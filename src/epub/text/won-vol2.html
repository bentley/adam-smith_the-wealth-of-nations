 monopoly of the home market, but desire likewise the most extensive
foreign sale for their goods. Their country has no jurisdiction in
foreign nations, and therefore can seldom procure them any monopoly
there. They are generally obliged, therefore, to content themselves with
 petitioning for certain encouragements to exportation.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_44">Of these encouragements what are called Drawbacks seem to be the<span class="type-margin"><span>Drawbacks of duty paid on domestic produce are reasonable, as they preserve the natural distribution of labour.</span></span>
 most reasonable. To allow the merchant to draw back upon exportation,
either the whole or a part of whatever excise or inland duty is imposed
upon domestic industry, can never occasion the exportation of a greater
quantity of goods than what would have been exported had no duty been
imposed. Such encouragements do not tend to turn towards any particular
employment a greater share of the capital of the country, than what
would go to that employment<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt002" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt002_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 of its own accord, but only to hinder the duty from driving away any
part of that share to other employments. They tend not to overturn that
balance which naturally establishes itself among all the various
employments of the society; but to hinder it from being overturned by
the duty. They tend not to destroy, but to preserve what it is in most
cases advantageous <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>2<span class="bracket">]</span></span> to preserve, the natural division and distribution of labour in the society.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_45"><span class="type-margin"><span>So are also drawbacks of duty paid on goods imported.</span></span>The
 same thing may be said of the drawbacks upon the re-exportation of
foreign goods imported; which in Great Britain generally amount to by
much the largest part of the duty upon importation.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt003" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt003_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> By the second of the rules, annexed to the act of parliament,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt004" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt004_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> which<span class="type-margin"><span>Under the old subsidy a drawback of one-half is allowed.</span></span>
 imposed, what is now called, the old subsidy, every merchant, whether
English or alien, was allowed to draw back half that duty upon
exportation; the English merchant, provided the exportation took place
within twelve months; the alien, provided it took place within nine
months. Wines, currants, and wrought silks were the only goods which did
 not fall within this rule, having other and more advantageous
allowances. The duties imposed by this act of parliament were, at that
time, the only duties upon the importation of foreign goods. The term
within which this, and all other drawbacks, could be claimed, was
afterwards (by 7 Geo. I. chap. 21. sect. 10.) extended to three years.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt005" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt005_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_46"><span class="type-margin"><span>Of more recent duties the whole is generally allowed,</span></span>The
 duties which have been imposed since the old subsidy, are, the greater
part of them, wholly drawn back upon exportation. This general rule,
however, is liable to a great number of exceptions, and the doctrine of
drawbacks has become a much less simple matter, than it was at their
first institution.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_47"><span class="type-margin"><span>and in some cases the whole even of the old subsidy is allowed.</span></span>Upon
 the exportation of some foreign goods, of which it was expected that
the importation would greatly exceed what was necessary for the home
consumption, the whole duties are drawn back, without retaining even
half the old subsidy. Before the revolt of our North American colonies,
we had the monopoly of the tobacco of Maryland and Virginia. We imported
 about ninety-six thousand hogsheads, and the home consumption was not
supposed to exceed fourteen thousand.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt006" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt006_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 To facilitate the great exportation which was necessary, in order to
rid us of the rest, the whole duties were drawn back, provided the
exportation took place within three years.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt007" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt007_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_48">We still have, though not altogether, yet very
nearly, the monopoly of the sugars of our West Indian islands. If sugars
 are exported within a year, therefore, all the duties upon importation
are drawn back,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt008" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt008_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">6</a> and if exported within three years, all the duties, except half <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>3<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 the old subsidy, which still continues to be retained upon the
exportation of the greater part of goods. Though the importation of
sugar exceeds, a good deal, what is necessary for the home consumption,
the excess is inconsiderable, in comparison of what it used to be in
tobacco.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_49">Some goods, the particular objects of the jealousy of our own manufacturers,<span class="type-margin"><span>In the case of some prohibited goods there is no drawback</span></span>
 are prohibited to be imported for home consumption. They may, however,
upon paying certain duties, be imported and warehoused for exportation.
But upon such exportation, no part of these duties are drawn back. Our
manufacturers are unwilling, it seems, that even this restricted
importation should be encouraged, and are afraid lest some part of these
 goods should be stolen out of the warehouse, and thus come into
competition with their own. It is under these regulations only that we
can import wrought silks,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt009" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt009_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> French cambrics and lawns,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt010" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt010_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> callicoes painted, printed, stained, or dyed, &amp;c.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_50">We are unwilling even to be the carriers of French goods, and choose<span class="type-margin"><span>French imports generally are allowed a smaller drawback on re-exportation</span></span>
 rather to forego a profit to ourselves, than to suffer those, whom we
consider as our enemies, to make any profit by our means. Not only half
the old subsidy, but the second twenty-five per cent. is retained upon
the exportation of all French goods.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt011" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt011_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_51">By the fourth of the rules annexed to the old subsidy, the drawback<span class="type-margin"><span>Wines have been peculiarly favoured,</span></span>
 allowed upon the exportation of all wines amounted to a great deal more
 than half the duties which were, at that time, paid upon their
importation; and it seems, at that time, to have been the object of the
legislature to give somewhat more than ordinary encouragement to the
carrying trade in wine. Several of the other duties too, which were
imposed, either at the same time, or subsequent to the old subsidy; what
 is called the additional duty, the new subsidy, the one-third and
two-thirds subsidies, the impost 1692, the coinage on wine, were allowed
 to be wholly drawn back upon exportation.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt012" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt012_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> All those duties, however, except the additional duty and impost 1692,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt013" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt013_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a>
 being paid down in ready money, upon importation, the interest of so
large a sum occasioned an expence, which made it unreasonable to expect
any profitable carrying trade in this article. Only a part, therefore,
of the duty called the impost on wine,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt014" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt014_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">6</a> and no part of the twenty-five <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>4<span class="bracket">]</span></span> pounds the ton upon French wines,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt015" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt015_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> or of the duties imposed in 1745,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt016" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt016_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> in 1763,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt017" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt017_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> and in 1778,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt018" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt018_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 were allowed to be drawn back upon exportation. The two imposts of five
 per cent., imposed in 1779 and 1781, upon all the former duties of
customs,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt019" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt019_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a>
 being allowed to be wholly drawn back upon the exportation of all other
 goods, were likewise allowed to be drawn back upon that of wine. The
last duty that has been particularly imposed upon wine, that of 1780,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt020" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt020_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">6</a>
 is allowed to be wholly drawn back, an indulgence, which, when so many
heavy duties are retained, most probably could never occasion the
exportation of a single ton of wine. These rules take place with regard
to all places of lawful exportation, except the British colonies in
America.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_52"><span class="type-margin"><span>especially when exported to the American colonies,</span></span>The 15th Charles II. chap. 7. called an act for the encouragement of trade,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt021" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt021_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">7</a>
 had given Great Britain the monopoly of supplying the colonies with all
 the commodities of the growth or manufacture of Europe; and
consequently with wines. In a country of so extensive a coast as our
North American and West Indian colonies, where our authority was always
so very slender, and where the inhabitants were allowed to carry out, in
 their own ships, their non-enumerated commodities, at first, to all
parts of Europe, and afterwards, to all parts of Europe South of Cape
Finisterre,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt022" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt022_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">8</a>
 it is not very probable that this monopoly could ever be much
respected; and they probably, at all times, found means of bringing back
 some cargo from the countries to which they were allowed to carry out
one. They seem, however, to have found some difficulty in importing
European wines from the places of their growth, and they could not well
import them from Great Britain, where they were loaded with many heavy
duties, of which a considerable part was not drawn back upon
exportation. Madeira wine, not being a European commodity,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt023" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt023_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">9</a>
 could be imported directly into America and the West Indies, countries
which, in all their non-enumerated commodities, enjoyed a free trade to
the island of Madeira. These circumstances had probably introduced that
general taste for <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>5<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 Madeira wine, which our officers found established in all our colonies
at the commencement of the war which began in 1755, and which they
brought back with them to the mother-country, where that wine had not
been much in fashion before. Upon the conclusion of that war, in 1763
(by the 4th Geo. III. Chap. 15. Sect. 12.), all the duties, except 3 <span class="ital">l.</span> 10 <span class="ital">s.</span>
 were allowed to be drawn back, upon the exportation to the colonies of
all wines, except French wines, to the commerce and consumption of which
 national prejudice would allow no sort of encouragement. The period
between the granting of this indulgence and the revolt of our North
American colonies was probably too short to admit of any considerable
change in the customs of those countries.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_53">The same act, which, in the drawback upon all wines, except French<span class="type-margin"><span>though the export of other foreign commodities to those colonies was discouraged.</span></span>
 wines, thus favoured the colonies so much more than other countries; in
 those, upon the greater part of other commodities, favoured them much
less. Upon the exportation of the greater part of commodities to other
countries, half the old subsidy was drawn back. But this law enacted,
that no part of that duty should be drawn back upon the exportation to
the colonies of any commodities, of the growth or manufacture either of
Europe or the East Indies, except wines, white callicoes and muslins.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt024" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt024_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_54">Drawbacks were, perhaps, originally granted for the encouragement<span class="type-margin"><span>Drawbacks were originally granted to encourage the carrying trade, which was absurd, but they are reasonable enough.</span></span>
 of the carrying trade, which, as the freight of the ships is frequently
 paid by foreigners in money, was supposed to be peculiarly fitted for
bringing gold and silver into the country. But though the carrying trade
 certainly deserves no peculiar encouragement, though the motive of the
institution was, perhaps, abundantly foolish, the institution itself
seems reasonable enough. Such drawbacks cannot force into this trade a
greater share of the capital of the country than what would have gone to
 it of its own accord, had there been no duties upon importation. They
only prevent its being excluded altogether by those duties. The carrying
 trade, though it deserves no preference, ought not to be precluded, but
 to be left free like all other trades. It is a necessary resource for
those capitals which cannot find employment either in the agriculture or
 in the manufactures of the country, either in its home trade or in its
foreign trade of consumption.</p>

<p id="Smith_0206-02_55"><span class="type-margin"><span>The revenue gains by their existence when they do not amount to the whole of the duty paid</span></span>The
 revenue of the customs, instead of suffering, profits from such
drawbacks, by that part of the duty which is retained. If the whole
duties had been retained, the foreign goods upon which they are paid,
could seldom have been exported, nor consequently imported, for want of a
 market. The duties, therefore, of which a part is retained, would never
 have been paid.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_56"><span class="type-margin"><span>They would be justified even if they always did amount to the whole duty paid,</span></span>These
 reasons seem sufficiently to justify drawbacks, and would justify them,
 though the whole duties, whether upon the produce of domestic industry,
 or upon foreign goods, were always drawn back upon exportation. The
revenue of excise would in this case, indeed, suffer a little, and that
of the customs a good deal more; but the natural balance of industry,
the natural division and distribution of labour, which is always more or
 less disturbed by such duties, would be more nearly re-established by
such a regulation.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_57"><span class="type-margin"><span>but only to independent countries, not to those in respect of which there is a monopoly of trade</span></span>These
 reasons, however, will justify drawbacks only upon exporting goods to
those countries which are altogether foreign and independent, not to
those in which our merchants and manufacturers enjoy a monopoly. A
drawback, for example, upon the exportation of European goods to our
American colonies, will not always occasion a greater exportation than
what would have taken place without it. By means of the monopoly which
our merchants and manufacturers enjoy there, the same quantity might
frequently, perhaps, be sent thither, though the whole duties were
retained. The drawback, therefore, may frequently be pure loss to the
revenue of excise and customs, without altering the state of the trade,
or rendering it in any respect more extensive. How far such drawbacks
can be justified, as a proper encouragement to the industry of our
colonies, or how far it is advantageous to the mother-country, that they
 should be exempted from taxes which are paid by all the rest of their
fellow-subjects, will appear hereafter<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt025" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt025_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> when I come to treat of colonies.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_58"><span class="type-margin"><span>They give rise to frauds</span></span>Drawbacks,
 however, it must always be understood, are useful only in those cases
in which the goods for the exportation of which they are given, are
really exported to some foreign country; and not clandestinely
re-imported into our own. That some drawbacks, particularly those upon
tobacco, have frequently been abused in this manner, and have given
occasion to many frauds equally hurtful both to the revenue and to the
fair trader, is well known.</p>

<h2 id="lf0206-02_label_056">CHAPTER V: OF BOUNTIES</h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-02_59">BOUNTIES upon exportation are, in Great Britain, frequently<span class="type-margin"><span>Foreigners cannot be forced to buy our goods, so it is proposed to pay them to do so.</span></span>
 petitioned for, and sometimes granted to the produce of particular
branches of domestic industry. By means of them our merchants and
manufacturers, it is pretended, will be enabled to sell their goods as
cheap or cheaper than their rivals in the foreign market. A greater
quantity, it is said, will thus be exported, and the balance of trade
consequently turned more in favour of our own country. We cannot give
our workmen a monopoly in the foreign, as we have done in the home
market. We cannot force foreigners to buy their goods, as we have done
our own countrymen. The next best expedient, it has been thought,
therefore, is to pay them for buying. It is in this manner that the
mercantile system proposes to enrich the whole country, and to put money
 into all our pockets by means of the balance of trade.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_60">Bounties, it is allowed, ought to be given to those branches of trade<span class="type-margin"><span>Bounties are not demanded for any but losing trades,</span></span>
 only which cannot be carried on without them. But every branch of trade
 in which the merchant can sell his goods for a price which replaces to
him, with the ordinary profits of stock, the whole capital employed in
preparing and sending them to market, can be carried on without a
bounty. Every such branch is evidently upon a level with all the other
branches of trade which are carried on without bounties, and cannot
therefore require one more than they. Those trades only require bounties
 in which the merchant is obliged to sell his goods for a price which
does not replace to him his capital, together with the ordinary profit;
or in which he is obliged to sell them for less than it really costs him
 to send them to market. The bounty is given in order to make up this
loss, and to encourage him to continue, or perhaps to begin, a trade of
which the expence is supposed to be greater than the returns, of which
every operation eats up a part of the capital <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>8<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 employed in it, and which is of such a nature, that, if all other
trades resembled it, there would soon be no capital left in the country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_61"><span class="type-margin"><span>and their effect is to force trade into disadvantageous channels.</span></span>The
 trades, it is to be observed, which are carried on by means of
bounties, are the only ones which can be carried on between two nations
for any considerable time together, in such a manner as that one of them
 shall always and regularly lose, or sell its goods for less than it
really costs to send them to market. But if the bounty did not repay to
the merchant what he would otherwise lose upon the price of his goods,
his own interest would soon oblige him to employ his stock in another
way, or to find out a trade in which the price of the goods would
replace to him, with the ordinary profit, the capital employed in
sending them to market. The effect of bounties, like that of all the
other expedients of the mercantile system, can only be to force the
trade of a country into a channel much less advantageous than that in
which it would naturally run of its own accord.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_62"><span class="type-margin"><span>Charles Smith forgets the cost of raising the corn upon which the bounty is paid.</span></span>The ingenious and well-informed author of the tracts upon the corn-trade<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt026" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt026_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 has shown very clearly, that since the bounty upon the exportation of
corn was first established, the price of the corn exported, valued
moderately enough, has exceeded that of the corn imported, valued very
high, by a much greater sum than the amount of the whole bounties which
have been paid during that period. This, he imagines, upon the true
principles of the mercantile system, is a clear proof that this forced
corn trade is beneficial to the nation; the value of the exportation
exceeding that of the importation by a much greater sum than the whole
extraordinary expence which the public has been at in order to get it
exported. He does not consider that this extraordinary expence, or the
bounty, is the smallest part of the expence which the exportation of
corn really costs the society. The capital which the farmer employed in
raising it, must likewise be taken into the account. Unless the price of
 the corn when sold in the foreign markets replaces, not only the
bounty, but this capital, together with the ordinary profits of stock,
the society is a loser by the difference, or the national stock is so
much diminished. But the very reason for which it has been thought
necessary to grant a bounty, is the supposed insufficiency of the price
to do this.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_63"><span class="type-margin"><span>The fall in the price of corn since the establishment of the bounty is due to other causes.</span></span>The
 average price of corn, it has been said, has fallen considerably since
the establishment of the bounty. That the average price of corn began to
 fall somewhat towards the end of the last century, and has continued to
 do so during the course of the sixty-four first years of the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>9<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 present, I have already endeavoured to show. But this event, supposing
it to be as real as I believe it to be, must have happened in spite of
the bounty, and cannot possibly have happened in consequence of it. It
has happened in France, as well as in England, though in France there
was, not only no bounty, but, till 1764, the exportation of corn was
subjected to a general prohibition.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt027" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt027_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 This gradual fall in the average price of grain, it is probable,
therefore, is ultimately owing neither to the one regulation nor to the
other, but to that gradual and insensible rise in the real value of
silver, which, in the first book of this discourse, I have endeavoured
to show has taken place in the general market of Europe, during the
course of the present century.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt028" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt028_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> It seems to be altogether impossible that the bounty could ever contribute to lower the price of grain.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt029" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt029_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_64">In years of plenty, it has already been observed,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt030" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt030_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> the bounty, by<span class="type-margin"><span>The bounty keeps up the price both in years of plenty and of scarcity.</span></span>
 occasioning an extraordinary exportation, necessarily keeps up the
price of corn in the home market above what it would naturally fall to.
To do so was the avowed purpose of the institution. In years of
scarcity, though the bounty is frequently suspended, yet the great
exportation which it occasions in years of plenty, must frequently
hinder more or less the plenty of one year from relieving the scarcity
of another. Both in years of plenty, and in years of scarcity,
therefore, the bounty necessarily tends to raise the money price of corn
 somewhat higher than it otherwise would be in the home market.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_65">That, in the actual state of tillage, the bounty must necessarily have<span class="type-margin"><span>It has been supposed to encourage cultivation and so to lower price</span></span>
 this tendency, will not, I apprehend, be disputed by any reasonable
person. But it has been thought by many people that it tends to
encourage tillage, and that in two different ways; first, by opening a
more extensive foreign market to the corn of the farmer, it tends, they
imagine, to increase the demand for, and consequently the production of
that commodity; and secondly, by securing to him a better price than he
could otherwise expect in the actual state of tillage, it tends, they
suppose, to encourage tillage. This double encouragement must, they
imagine, in a long period of years, occasion such an increase in the
production of corn, as may lower its price in the home market, much more
 than the bounty can raise it, in the actual state which tillage may, at
 the end of that period, happen to be in.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt031" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt031_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>10<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_66"><span class="type-margin"><span>The addition to
 the price of corn at home caused by the bounty is a heavy tax on the
people, which restrains population and industry and in the long run
tends to diminish the consumption of corn</span></span>I answer, that
whatever extension of the foreign market can be occasioned by the
bounty, must, in every particular year, be altogether at the expence of
the home market; as every bushel of corn which is exported by means of
the bounty, and which would not have been exported without the bounty,
would have remained in the home market to increase the consumption, and
to lower the price of that commodity. The corn bounty, it is to be
observed, as well as every other bounty upon exportation, imposes two
different taxes upon the people; first, the tax which they are obliged
to contribute, in order to pay the bounty; and secondly, the tax which
arises from the advanced price of the commodity in the home market, and
which, as the whole body of the people are purchasers of corn, must, in
this particular commodity, be paid by the whole body of the people. In
this particular commodity, therefore, this second tax is by much the
heaviest of the two. Let us suppose that, taking one year with another,
the bounty of five shillings upon the exportation of the quarter of
wheat, raises the price of that commodity in the home market only
sixpence the bushel, or four shillings the quarter, higher than it
otherways would have been in the actual state of the crop. Even upon
this very moderate supposition,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt032" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt032_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 the great body of the people, over and above contributing the tax which
 pays the bounty of five shillings upon every quarter of wheat exported,
 must pay another of four shillings upon every quarter which they
themselves consume. But, according to the very well informed author of
the tracts upon the corn-trade, the average proportion of the corn
exported to that consumed at home, is not more than that of one to
thirty-one.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt033" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt033_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 For every five shillings, therefore, which they contribute to the
payment of the first tax, they must contribute six pounds four shillings
 to the payment of the second. So very heavy a tax upon the first
necessary of life, must either reduce the subsistence of the labouring
poor, or it must occasion some augmentation in their pecuniary wages,
proportionable to that in the pecuniary price of their subsistence. So
far as it operates in the one way, it must reduce the ability of the
labouring poor to educate and bring up their children, and must, so far,
 tend to restrain the population of the country. So far as it operates
in the other, it must reduce <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>11<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 the ability of the employers of the poor, to employ so great a number
as they otherwise might do, and must, so far, tend to restrain the
industry of the country. The extraordinary exportation of corn,
therefore, occasioned by the bounty, not only, in every particular year,
 diminishes the home, just as much as it extends the foreign market and
consumption, but, by restraining the population and industry of the
country, its final tendency is to stunt and restrain the gradual
extension of the home market; and thereby, in the long run, rather to
diminish, than to augment, the whole market and consumption of corn.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_67">This enhancement of the money price of corn, however, it has been<span class="type-margin"><span>The enhancement of price would encourage production if it was an enhancement of real price, but it is not,</span></span> thought, by rendering that commodity more profitable to the farmer, must necessarily encourage its production.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt034" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt034_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_68">I answer, that this might be the case if the
effect of the bounty was to raise the real price of corn, or to enable
the farmer, with an equal quantity of it, to maintain a greater number
of labourers in the same manner, whether liberal, moderate, or scanty,
that other labourers are commonly maintained in his neighbourhood. But
neither the bounty, it is evident, nor any other human institution, can
have any such effect. It is not the real, but the nominal price of corn,
 which can in any considerable degree be affected by the bounty.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt035" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt035_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 And though the tax which that institution imposes upon the whole body
of the people, may be very burdensome to those who pay it, it is of very
 little advantage to those who receive it.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt036" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt036_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_69">The real effect of the bounty is not so much to raise the real value<span class="type-margin"><span>It is only a degradation of the value of silver</span></span>
 of corn, as to degrade the real value of silver; or to make an equal
quantity of it exchange for a smaller quantity, not only of corn, but of
 all other home-made commodities: for the money price of corn regulates
that of all other home-made<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt037" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt037_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> commodities.</p>

 certain proportion to that of corn, though this proportion is different
 in different periods. It regulates, for example, the money price of
grass and hay, of butcher’s meat, of horses, and the maintenance of
horses, of land carriage consequently, or of the greater part of the
inland commerce of the country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_72"><span class="type-margin"><span>and of almost all manufactures.</span></span>By regulating the money price of all the other parts of the rude produce of land, it regulates that of the materials of almost<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt038" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt038_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 all manufactures. By regulating the money price of labour, it regulates
 that of manufacturing art and industry. And by regulating both, it
regulates that of the complete manufacture. The money price of labour,
and of every thing that is the produce either of land or labour, must
necessarily either rise or fall in proportion to the money price of
corn.</p>

 in consequence of the bounty, therefore, the farmer should be enabled
to sell his corn for four shillings the bushel instead of three and
sixpence, and to pay his landlord a money rent proportionable to this
rise in the money price of his produce; yet if, in consequence of this
rise in the price of corn, four shillings will purchase no more

 better. In the purchase of foreign commodities this enhancement in the
price of corn may give them some little advantage. In that of home-made
commodities it can give them none at all. And almost the whole expence
of the farmer, and the far greater part even of that of the landlord, is
 in home-made commodities.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt042" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt042_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a></p>

 degradation in the value of silver which is the effect of the fertility
 of the mines, and which operates equally, or very near equally, through
 the greater part of the commercial world, is a matter of very little
consequence to any particular country. The consequent rise of all money
prices, though it does not make those who receive them really richer,
does not make them really poorer. A service of plate becomes really
cheaper, and every thing else remains precisely of the same real value
as before.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_75"><span class="type-margin"><span>but degradation confined to one country discourages the industry of that country.</span></span>But
 that degradation in the value of silver which, being the effect either
of the peculiar situation, or of the political institutions of a
particular country, takes place only in that country, is a matter of
very <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>13<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 great consequence, which, far from tending to make any body really
richer, tends to make every body really poorer. The rise in the money
price of all commodities, which is in this case peculiar to that
country, tends to discourage more or less every sort of industry which
is carried on within it, and to enable foreign nations, by furnishing
almost all sorts of goods for a smaller quantity of silver than its own
workmen can afford to do, to undersell them, not only in the foreign,
but even in the home market.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_76">It is the peculiar situation of Spain and Portugal as proprietors of<span class="type-margin"><span>In Spain and Portugal gold and silver are naturally cheaper than in the rest of Europe,</span></span>
 the mines, to be the distributors of gold and silver to all the other
countries of Europe. Those metals ought naturally, therefore, to be
somewhat cheaper in Spain and Portugal than in any other part of Europe.
 The difference, however, should be no more than the amount of the
freight and insurance; and, on account of the great value and small bulk
 of those metals, their freight is no great matter, and their insurance
is the same as that of any other goods of equal value. Spain and
Portugal, therefore, could suffer very little from their peculiar
situation, if they did not aggravate its disadvantages by their
political institutions.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_77">Spain by taxing, and Portugal by prohibiting the exportation of<span class="type-margin"><span>but by the hindrances to exportation they are made still cheaper,</span></span>
 gold and silver, load that exportation with the expence of smuggling,
and raise the value of those metals in other countries so much more
above what it is in their own, by the whole amount of this expence.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt043" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt043_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 When you dam up a stream of water, as soon as the dam is full, as much
water must run over the dam-head as if there was no dam at all. The
prohibition of exportation cannot detain a greater quantity of gold and
silver in Spain and Portugal than what they can afford to employ, than
what the annual produce of their land and labour will allow them to
employ, in coin, plate, gilding, and other ornaments of gold and silver.
 When they have got this quantity the dam is full, and the whole stream
which flows in afterwards must run over. The annual exportation of gold
and silver from Spain and Portugal accordingly is, by all accounts,
notwithstanding these restraints, very near equal to the whole annual
importation. As the water, however, must always be deeper behind the
dam-head than before it, so the quantity of gold and silver which these
restraints detain in Spain and Portugal must, in proportion to the
annual produce of their land and labour, be greater than what is to be
found in other countries. The higher and <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>14<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 stronger the dam-head, the greater must be the difference in the depth
of water behind and before it. The higher the tax, the higher the
penalties with which the prohibition is guarded, the more vigilant and
severe the police which looks after the execution of the law, the
greater must be the difference in the proportion of gold and silver to
the annual produce of the land and labour of Spain and Portugal, and to
that of other countries. It is said accordingly to be very considerable,
 and that you frequently find there a profusion of plate in houses,
where there is nothing else which would, in other countries, be thought
suitable or correspondent to this sort of magnificence. The cheapness of
 gold and silver, or what is the same thing, the dearness of all
commodities, which is the necessary effect of this redundancy of the<span class="type-margin"><span>and agriculture and manufactures are thereby discouraged.</span></span>
 precious metals, discourages both the agriculture and manufactures of
Spain and Portugal, and enables foreign nations to supply them with many
 sorts of rude, and with almost all sorts of manufactured produce, for a
 smaller quantity of gold and silver than what they themselves can
either raise or make them for at home. The tax and prohibition operate
in two different ways. They not only lower very much the value of the
precious metals in Spain and Portugal, but by detaining there a certain
quantity of those metals which would otherwise flow over other
countries, they keep up their value in those other countries somewhat
above what it otherwise would be, and thereby give those countries a
double advantage in their commerce with Spain and Portugal. Open the
flood-gates, and there will presently be less water above, and more
below, the dam-head, and it will soon come to a level in both places.
Remove the tax and the prohibition, and as the quantity of gold and
silver will diminish considerably in Spain and Portugal, so it will
increase somewhat in other countries, and the value of those metals,
their proportion to the annual produce of land and labour, will soon
come to a level, or very near to a level, in all. The loss which Spain
and Portugal could sustain by this exportation of their gold and silver
would be altogether nominal and imaginary. The nominal value of their
goods, and of the annual produce of their land and labour, would fall,
and would be expressed or represented by a smaller quantity of silver
than before; but their real value would be the same as before, and would
 be sufficient to maintain, command, and employ, the same quantity of
labour. As the nominal value of their goods would fall, the real value
of what remained of their gold and silver would rise, and a smaller
quantity of those metals would answer all the same purposes of commerce
and circulation which had employed a greater quantity before. The gold <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>15<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 and silver which would go abroad would not go abroad for nothing, but
would bring back an equal value of goods of some kind or another. Those
goods too would not be all matters of mere luxury and expence, to be
consumed by idle people who produce nothing in return for their
consumption. As the real wealth and revenue of idle people would not be
augmented by this extraordinary exportation of gold and silver, so
neither would their consumption be much augmented by it. Those goods
would, probably, the greater part of them, and certainly some part of
them, consist in materials, tools, and provisions, for the employment
and maintenance of industrious people, who would reproduce, with a
profit, the full value of their consumption. A part of the dead stock of
 the society would thus be turned into active stock, and would put into
motion a greater quantity of industry than had been employed before. The
 annual produce of their land and labour would immediately be augmented a
 little, and in a few years would, probably, be augmented a great deal;
their industry being thus relieved from one of the most oppressive
burdens which it at present labours under.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_78">The bounty upon the exportation of corn necessarily operates<span class="type-margin"><span>The corn bounty acts in the same way,</span></span>
 exactly in the same way as this absurd policy of Spain and Portugal.
Whatever be the actual state of tillage, it renders our corn somewhat
dearer in the home market than it otherwise would be in that state, and
somewhat cheaper in the foreign; and as the average money price of corn
regulates more or less that of all other commodities, it lowers the
value of silver considerably in the one, and tends to raise it a little
in the other. It enables foreigners, the Dutch in particular, not only
to eat our corn cheaper than they otherwise could do, but sometimes to
eat it cheaper than even our own people can do upon the same occasions;
as we are assured by an excellent authority, that of Sir Matthew Decker.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt044" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt044_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 It hinders our own workmen from furnishing their goods for so small a
quantity of silver as they otherwise might do; and enables the Dutch to
furnish their’s for a smaller. It tends to render our manufactures
somewhat dearer in every market, and their’s somewhat cheaper than they
otherwise would be, and consequently to give their industry a double
advantage over our own.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_79"><span class="type-margin"><span>it discourages manufactures without much benefiting farmers and country gentlemen.</span></span>The bounty, as it raises in the home market, not so much the real, as the nominal price<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt045" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt045_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 of our corn, as it augments, not the quantity of labour which a certain
 quantity of corn can maintain and employ, but only the quantity of
silver which it will exchange for, it discourages <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>16<span class="bracket">]</span></span> our manufactures, without rendering any considerable service<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt046" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt046_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 either to our farmers or country gentlemen. It puts, indeed, a little
more money into the pockets of both, and it will perhaps be somewhat
difficult to persuade the greater part of them that this is not
rendering them a very considerable service.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt047" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt047_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> But if this money sinks in its value, in the quantity of labour, provisions, and home-made<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt048" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt048_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 commodities of all different kinds which it is capable of purchasing,
as much as it rises in its quantity, the service will be little more
than nominal<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt049" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt049_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> and imaginary.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_80"><span class="type-margin"><span>It is essentially serviceable only to the corn merchants.</span></span>There
 is, perhaps, but one set of men in the whole commonwealth to whom the
bounty either was or could be essentially serviceable.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt050" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt050_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a>
 These were the corn merchants, the exporters and importers of corn. In
years of plenty the bounty necessarily occasioned a greater exportation
than would otherwise have taken place; and by hindering the plenty of
one year from relieving the scarcity of another, it occasioned in years
of scarcity a greater importation than would otherwise have been
necessary. It increased the business of the corn merchant in both; and
in years of scarcity, it not only enabled him to import a greater
quantity, but to sell it for a better price, and consequently with a
greater profit than he could otherwise have made, if the plenty of one
year had not been more or less hindered from relieving the scarcity of
another. It is in this set of men, accordingly, that I have observed the
 greatest zeal for the continuance or renewal of the bounty.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_81"><span class="type-margin"><span>The country gentlemen established the duties on the importation of corn, and the bounty, in imitation of the manufacturers,</span></span>Our
 country gentlemen, when they imposed the high duties upon the
importation of foreign corn, which in times of moderate plenty amount to
 a prohibition, and when they established the bounty, seem to have
imitated the conduct of our manufacturers. By the one institution, they
secured to themselves the monopoly of the home market, and by the other
they endeavoured to prevent that market from ever being overstocked with
 their commodity. By both they endeavoured to raise its real value, in
the same manner as our manufacturers had, by the like institutions,
raised the real value of many different sorts of manufactured goods.
They did not perhaps attend to the great and essential difference which
nature has established between corn and almost every other sort of
goods.<span class="type-margin"><span>without attending to the essential difference between corn and other goods.</span></span> When, either by the monopoly of the home market, or by a bounty upon exportation, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>17<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 you enable our woollen or linen manufacturers to sell their goods for
somewhat a better price than they otherwise could get for them, you
raise, not only the nominal, but the real price of those goods. You
render them equivalent to a greater quantity of labour and subsistence,
you encrease not only the nominal, but the real profit, the real wealth
and revenue of those manufacturers, and you enable them either to live
better themselves, or to employ a greater quantity of labour in those
particular manufactures. You really encourage those manufactures, and
direct towards them a greater quantity of the industry of the country,
than what would probably go to them of its own accord. But when by the
like institutions you raise the nominal or money-price of corn, you do
not raise its real value. You do not increase the real wealth, the real
revenue either of our farmers or country gentlemen. You do not encourage
 the growth of corn, because you do not enable them to maintain and
employ more labourers in raising it. The nature of things has stamped
upon corn a real value which cannot be altered by merely altering its
money price.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt051" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt051_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> No bounty upon exportation, no monopoly of the home market, can raise that value.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt052" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt052_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 The freest competition cannot lower it. Through the world in general
that value is equal to the quantity of labour which it can maintain, and
 in every particular place it is equal to the quantity of labour which
it can maintain in the way, whether liberal, moderate, or scanty, in
which labour is commonly maintained in that place. Woollen or linen
cloth are not the regulating commodities by which the real value of all
other commodities must be finally measured and determined; corn is. The
real value of every other commodity is finally measured and determined
by the proportion which its average money price bears to the average
money price of corn. The real value of corn does not vary with those
variations in its average money price, which sometimes occur from one
century to another. It is the real value of silver which varies with
them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_82">Bounties upon the exportation of any home-made commodity are<span class="type-margin"><span>All
 the expedients of the mercantile system force industry into less
advantageous channels, bounties on exports force it into actually
disadvantageous channels the bounty on corn does not encourage its
production.</span></span> liable, first, to that general objection which
 may be made to all the different expedients of the mercantile system;
the objection of forcing some part of the industry of the country into a
 channel less advantageous than that in which it would run of its own
accord: and, secondly, to the particular objection of forcing it, not
only into a channel that is less advantageous, but into one that is
actually disadvantageous; the trade which cannot be carried on but by
means of a bounty being <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>18<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 necessarily a losing trade. The bounty upon the exportation of corn is
liable to this further objection, that it can in no respect promote the
raising of that particular commodity of which it was meant to encourage
the production. When our country gentlemen, therefore, demanded the
establishment of the bounty, though they acted in imitation of our
merchants and manufacturers, they did not act with that complete
comprehension of their own interest which commonly directs the conduct
of those two other orders of people. They loaded the public revenue with
 a very considerable expence; they imposed a very heavy tax upon the
whole body of the people; but they did not, in any sensible degree,
increase<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt053" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt053_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 the real value of their own commodity; and by lowering somewhat the
real value of silver, they discouraged, in some degree, the general
industry of the country, and, instead of advancing, retarded more or
less the improvement of their own lands, which necessarily depends upon
the general industry of the country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_83"><span class="type-margin"><span>A bounty on production would be more effectual than one on exportation and would lower the price of the commodity,</span></span>To
 encourage the production of any commodity, a bounty upon production,
one should imagine, would have a more direct operation, than one upon
exportation. It would, besides, impose only one tax upon the people,
that which they must contribute in order to pay the bounty. Instead of
raising, it would tend to lower the price of the commodity in the home
market; and thereby, instead of imposing a second tax upon the people,
it might, at least in part, repay them for what they had contributed to
the first. Bounties upon production, however, have been very rarely
granted.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt054" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt054_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 The prejudices established by the commercial system have taught us to
believe, that national wealth arises more immediately from exportation
than from production.<span class="type-margin"><span>but such bounties have been rare,</span></span>
 It has been more favoured accordingly, as the more immediate means of
bringing money into the country. Bounties upon production, it has been
said too, have been found by experience more liable to frauds than those
 upon exportation. How far this is true, I know not. That bounties upon
exportation have been abused to many fraudulent purposes, is very well
known. But it is not the interest of merchants and manufacturers, the
great inventors of all these expedients, that the home market should be
overstocked with their goods, an event which a bounty upon production<span class="type-margin"><span>owing to the interest of merchants and manufacturers</span></span> might sometimes occasion. A bounty upon <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>19<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 exportation, by enabling them to send abroad the surplus part, and to
keep up the price of what remains in the home market, effectually
prevents this. Of all the expedients of the mercantile system,
accordingly, it is the one of which they are the fondest. I have known
the different undertakers of some particular works agree privately among
 themselves to give a bounty out of their own pockets upon the
exportation of a certain proportion of the goods which they dealt in.
This expedient succeeded so well, that it more than doubled the price of
 their goods in the home market, notwithstanding a very considerable
increase in the produce. The operation of the bounty upon corn must have
 been wonderfully different, if it has lowered the money price of that
commodity.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_84">Something like a bounty upon production, however, has been granted<span class="type-margin"><span>The herring and whale fishery bounties are in part given on production.</span></span> upon some particular occasions.

 are the same as those of bounties upon exportation. By means of them a
part of the capital of the country is employed in bringing goods to

<p id="Smith_0206-02_86"><span class="type-margin"><span>In granting the herring bounties Parliament has been imposed on, since (1) the herring buss bounty is too large,</span></span>Notwithstanding
 these favourable allegations, however, the following considerations
dispose me to believe, that in granting at least one of these bounties,
the legislature has been very grossly imposed upon.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_87">First, the herring buss bounty seems too large.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_88">From the commencement of the winter fishing
1771 to the end of the winter fishing 1781, the tonnage bounty upon the
herring buss fishery has been at thirty shillings the ton. During these
eleven years the whole number of barrels caught by the herring buss
fishery of Scotland amounted to 378,347. The herrings caught and cured
at sea, are called sea sticks.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt065" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt065_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 In order to render them what are called merchantable herrings, it is
necessary to repack them with an additional quantity of salt; and in
this case, it is reckoned, that three barrels of sea sticks, are usually
 repacked into two barrels of merchantable herrings. The number of
barrels of merchantable herrings, therefore, caught during these eleven
years, will amount only, according to this account, to 252,231⅓. During
these eleven years the tonnage bounties paid amounted to 155,463 <span class="ital">l.</span> 11 <span class="ital">s.</span> or to 8 <span class="ital">s.</span> 2¼ <span class="ital">d.</span> upon every barrel of sea sticks, and to 12 <span class="ital">s.</span> 3¾ <span class="ital">d.</span> upon every barrel of merchantable herrings.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_89">The salt with which these herrings are cured,
is sometimes Scotch, and sometimes foreign salt; both which are
delivered free of all excise duty to the fish-curers. The excise duty
upon Scotch salt is at present 1 <span class="ital">s.</span> 6 <span class="ital">d.</span> that upon foreign salt 10 <span class="ital">s.</span>
 the bushel. A barrel of herrings is supposed to require about one
bushel and one-fourth of a bushel foreign salt. Two bushels are the
supposed average of Scotch salt. If the herrings are entered for
exportation, no part of this duty is paid up; if entered for home
consumption, whether the herrings were cured with foreign or with Scotch
 salt, only one shilling the barrel is paid up. It was the old Scotch
duty upon a bushel of salt, the quantity which, at a low estimation, had
 been supposed necessary for curing a barrel of herrings. In Scotland,
foreign salt is very little used for any other purpose but the curing of
 fish. But from the 5th April 1771, to the 5th April 1782, the quantity
of foreign salt imported amounted to 936,974 bushels, at eighty-four
pounds the bushel: the quantity of Scotch salt delivered from the works
to the fish-curers, to no more than 168,226, at fifty-six pounds the
bushel only. It would appear, therefore, that it is principally foreign
salt that is used in the fisheries. Upon every barrel of herrings
exported there is, besides, a bounty of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>21<span class="bracket">]</span></span> 2 <span class="ital">s.</span> 8 <span class="ital">d.</span>
 and more than two-thirds of the buss caught herrings are exported. Put
all these things together, and you will find that, during these eleven
years, every barrel of buss caught herrings, cured with Scotch salt when
 exported, has cost government 17 <span class="ital">s.</span> 11¾ <span class="ital">d.;</span> and when entered for home consumption 14 <span class="ital">s.</span> 3¾ <span class="ital">d.:</span> and that every barrel cured with foreign salt, when exported, has cost government 1 <span class="ital">l.</span> 7 v. 5¾ <span class="ital">d.;</span> and when entered for home consumption 1 <span class="ital">l.</span> 3 <span class="ital">s.</span> 9¾ <span class="ital">d.</span>
 The price of a barrel of good merchantable herrings runs from seventeen
 and eighteen to four and five and twenty shillings; about a guinea at
an average.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt066" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt066_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_90">Secondly, the bounty to the white herring fishery is a tonnage<span class="type-margin"><span>(2) the bounty is not proportioned to the fish caught,</span></span>
 bounty; and is proportioned to the burden of the ship, not to her
diligence or success in the fishery; and it has, I am afraid, been too
common for vessels to fit out for the sole purpose of catching, not the
fish, but the bounty. In the year 1759, when the bounty was at fifty
shillings the ton, the whole buss fishery of Scotland brought in only
four barrels of sea sticks. In that year each barrel of sea sticks cost
government in bounties alone 113 <span class="ital">l.</span> 15 <span class="ital">s.;</span> each barrel of merchantable herrings 159 <span class="ital">l.</span> 7 <span class="ital">s.</span> 6 <span class="ital">d.</span></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_91">Thirdly, the mode of fishing for which this tonnage bounty in the<span class="type-margin"><span>(3) the bounty is given to busses, whereas the fishery ought to be carried on by boats,</span></span>
 white herring fishery has been given (by busses or decked vessels from
twenty to eighty tons burthen), seems not so well adapted to the
situation of Scotland as to that of Holland; from the practice of which
country it appears to have been borrowed. Holland lies at a great
distance from the seas to which herrings are known principally to
resort; and can, therefore, carry on that fishery only in decked
vessels, which can carry water and provisions sufficient for a voyage to
 a distant sea. But the Hebrides or western islands, the islands of
Shetland, and the northern and north-western coasts of Scotland, the
countries in whose neighbourhood the herring fishery is principally
carried on, are everywhere intersected by arms of the sea, which run up a
 considerable way into the land, and which, in the language of the
country, are called sea-lochs. It is to these sea-lochs that the
herrings principally resort during the seasons in which they visit those
 seas; for the visits of this, and, I am assured, of many other sorts of
 fish, are not quite regular and constant. A boat fishery, therefore,
seems to be the mode of fishing best adapted to the peculiar situation
of Scotland: the fishers carrying the herrings on shore, as fast as they
 are taken, to be either cured or consumed fresh. But the great
encouragement which a bounty of thirty shillings the ton gives to the
buss fishery, is necessarily a <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>22<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 discouragement to the boat fishery; which, having no such bounty,
cannot bring its cured fish to market upon the same terms as the buss
fishery. The boat fishery, accordingly, which, before the establishment
of the buss bounty, was very considerable, and is said to have employed a
 number of seamen, not inferior to what the buss fishery employs at
present, is now gone almost entirely to decay. Of the former extent,
however, of this now ruined and abandoned fishery, I must acknowledge,
that I cannot pretend to speak with much precision. As no bounty was
paid upon the outfit of the boat-fishery, no account was taken of it by
the officers of the customs or salt duties.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_92"><span class="type-margin"><span>(4) the bounty has raised, or at any rate not lowered, the price of herrings.</span></span>Fourthly,
 in many parts of Scotland, during certain seasons of the year, herrings
 make no inconsiderable part of the food of the common people. A bounty,
 which tended to lower their price in the home market, might contribute a
 good deal to the relief of a great number of our fellow-subjects, whose
 circumstances are by no means affluent. But the herring buss bounty
contributes to no such good purpose. It has ruined the boat fishery,
which is, by far, the best adapted for the supply of the home market,
and the additional bounty of 2 <span class="ital">s.</span> 8 <span class="ital">d.</span>
 the barrel upon exportation, carries the greater part, more than two
thirds, of the produce of the buss fishery abroad. Between thirty and
forty years ago, before the establishment of the buss bounty, sixteen
shillings the barrel, I have been assured, was the common price of white
 herrings. Between ten and fifteen years ago, before the boat fishery
was entirely ruined, the price is said to have run from seventeen to
twenty shillings the barrel. For these last five years, it has, at an
average, been at twenty-five shillings the barrel. This high price,
however, may have been owing to the real scarcity of the herrings upon
the coast of Scotland. I must observe too, that the cask or barrel,
which is usually sold with the herrings, and of which the price is
included in all the foregoing prices, has, since the commencement of the
 American war, risen to about double its former price, or from about
three shillings to about six shillings. I must likewise observe, that
the accounts I have received of the prices of former times, have been by
 no means quite uniform and consistent; and an old man of great accuracy
 and experience has assured me, that more than fifty years ago, a guinea
 was the usual price of a barrel of good merchantable herrings; and
this, I imagine, may still be looked upon as the average price. All
accounts, however, I think, agree, that the price has not been lowered
in the home market, in consequence of the buss bounty.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_93"><span class="type-margin"><span>Profits in the business have not been high.</span></span>When
 the undertakers of fisheries, after such liberal bounties have been
bestowed upon them, continue to sell their commodity at the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>23<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 same, or even at a higher price than they were accustomed to do before,
 it might be expected that their profits should be very great; and it is
 not improbable that those of some individuals may have been so. In
general, however, I have every reason to believe, they have been quite
otherwise. The usual effect of such bounties is to encourage rash
undertakers to adventure in a business which they do not understand, and
 what they lose by their own negligence and ignorance, more than
compensates all that they can gain by the utmost liberality of
government. In 1750, by the same act which first gave the bounty of
thirty shillings the ton for the encouragement of the white herring
fishery (the 23 Geo. II. chap. 24.), a joint stock company was erected,
with a capital of five hundred thousand pounds, to which the subscribers
 (over and above all other encouragements, the tonnage bounty just now
mentioned, the exportation bounty of two shillings and eight pence the
barrel, the delivery of both British and foreign salt duty free) were,
during the space of fourteen years, for every hundred pounds which they
subscribed and paid into the stock of the society, entitled to three
pounds a year, to be paid by the receiver-general of the customs in
equal half-yearly payments. Besides this great company, the residence of
 whose governor and directors was to be in London, it was declared
lawful to erect different fishing-chambers in all the different
out-ports of the kingdom, provided a sum not less than ten thousand
pounds was subscribed into the capital of each, to be managed at its own
 risk, and for its own profit and loss. The same annuity, and the same
encouragements of all kinds, were given to the trade of those inferior
chambers, as to that of the great company. The subscription of the great
 company was soon filled up, and several different fishing-chambers were
 erected in the different out-ports of the kingdom. In spite of all
these encouragements, almost all those different companies, both great
and small, lost either the whole, or the greater part of their capitals;
 scarce a vestige now remains of any of them, and the white herring
fishery is now entirely, or almost entirely, carried on by private
adventurers.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_94">If any particular manufacture was necessary, indeed, for the defence<span class="type-margin"><span>Bounties for manufactures necessary for the defence of the country are not un reasonable</span></span>
 of the society, it might not always be prudent to depend upon our
neighbours for the supply; and if such manufacture could not otherwise
be supported at home, it might not be unreasonable that all the other
branches of industry should be taxed in order to support it. The
bounties upon the exportation of British-made sail-cloth, and
British-made gun-powder, may, perhaps, both be vindicated upon this
principle.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>24<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_95"><span class="type-margin"><span>It is less absurd to give bounties in time of prosperity than in times of distress</span></span>But
 though it can very seldom be reasonable to tax the industry of the
great body of the people, in order to support that of some particular
class of manufacturers; yet in the wantonness of great prosperity, when
the public enjoys a greater revenue than it knows well what to do with,
to give such bounties to favourite manufactures, may, perhaps, be as
natural, as to incur any other idle expence. In public, as well as in
private expences, great wealth may, perhaps, frequently be admitted as
an apology for great folly. But there must surely be something more than
 ordinary absurdity, in continuing such profusion in times of general
difficulty and distress.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt067" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt067_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_96"><span class="type-margin"><span>Some allowances called bounties are, properly speaking, drawbacks</span></span>What
 is called a bounty is sometimes no more than a drawback, and
consequently is not liable to the same objections as what is properly a
bounty. The bounty, for example, upon refined sugar exported, may be
considered as a drawback of the duties upon the brown and muscovado
sugars from which it is made. The bounty upon wrought silk exported, a
drawback of the duties upon raw and thrown silk imported. The bounty
upon gunpowder exported, a drawback of the duties upon brimstone and
saltpetre imported. In the language of the customs those allowances only
 are called drawbacks, which are given upon goods exported in the same
form in which they are imported. When that form has been so altered by
manufacture of any kind, as to come under a new denomination, they are
called bounties.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt068" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt068_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_97"><span class="type-margin"><span>Prizes to successful artists and manufacturers do not divert industry to less advantageous channels, but encourage perfection.</span></span>Premiums
 given by the public to artists and manufacturers who excel in their
particular occupations, are not liable to the same objections as
bounties. By encouraging extraordinary dexterity and ingenuity, they
serve to keep up the emulation of the workmen actually employed in those
 respective occupations, and are not considerable enough to turn towards
 any one of them a greater share of the capital of the country than what
 would go to it of its own accord. Their tendency is not to overturn the
 natural balance of employments, but to render the work which is done in
 each as perfect and complete as possible. The expence of premiums,
besides, is very trifling; that of bounties very great. The bounty upon
corn alone has sometimes cost the public in one year more than three
hundred thousand pounds.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt069" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt069_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_98">Bounties are sometimes called premiums, as
drawbacks are sometimes called bounties. But we must in all cases attend
 to the nature of the thing, without paying any regard to the word.</p>

<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-02_99">I CANNOT conclude this chapter concerning bounties, without<span class="type-margin"><span>The corn bounty and corn laws are undeserving of praise</span></span>
 observing that the praises which have been bestowed upon the law which
establishes the bounty upon the exportation of corn, and upon that
system of regulations which is connected with it, are altogether
unmerited. A particular examination of the nature of the corn trade, and
 of the principal British laws which relate to it, will sufficiently
demonstrate the truth of this assertion. The great importance of this
subject must justify the length of the digression.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_100">The trade of the corn merchant is composed of four different branches,<span class="type-margin"><span>There are four branches of the corn trade</span></span>
 which, though they may sometimes be all carried on by the same person,
are in their own nature four separate and distinct trades. These are,
first, the trade of the inland dealer; secondly, that of the merchant
importer for home consumption; thirdly, that of the merchant exporter of
 home produce for foreign consumption; and, fourthly, that of the
merchant carrier, or of the importer of corn in order to export it
again.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_101"><span id="lf0206-02_label_102">I.</span> The interest of the inland dealer, and that of the great body of<span class="type-margin"><span><span id="lf0206-02_label_103">I.</span> The Inland Dealer, whose interest is the same as that of the people, <span class="ital">vis.,</span> that the consumption should be proportioned to the supply available.</span></span>
 the people, how opposite soever they may at first sight appear, are,
even in years of the greatest scarcity, exactly the same. It is his
interest to raise the price of his corn as high as the real scarcity of
the season requires, and it can never be his interest to raise it
higher. By raising the price he discourages the consumption, and puts
every body more or less, but particularly the inferior ranks of people,
upon thrift and good management. If, by raising it too high, he
discourages the consumption so much that the supply of the season is
likely to go beyond the consumption of the season, and to last for some
time after the next crop begins to come in, he runs the hazard, not only
 of losing a considerable part of his corn by natural causes, but of
being obliged to sell what remains of it for much less than what he
might have had for it several months before. If by not raising the price
 high enough he discourages the consumption so little, that the supply
of the season is likely to fall short of the consumption of the season,
he not only loses a part of the profit which he might otherwise have
made, but he exposes the people to suffer before the end of the season,
instead of the hardships of a dearth, the dreadful horrors of a famine.
It is the interest of the people that their daily, weekly, and monthly
consumption, should be proportioned as exactly as possible to the supply
 <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>26<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of the season. The interest of the inland corn dealer is the same. By
supplying them, as nearly as he can judge, in this proportion, he is
likely to sell all his corn for the highest price, and with the greatest
 profit; and his knowledge of the state of the crop, and of his daily,
weekly, and monthly sales, enable<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt071" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt071_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 him to judge, with more or less accuracy, how far they really are
supplied in this manner. Without intending the interest of the people,
he is necessarily led, by a regard to his own interest, to treat them,
even in years of scarcity, pretty much in the same manner as the prudent
 master of a vessel is sometimes obliged to treat his crew. When he
foresees that provisions are likely to run short, he puts them upon
short allowance. Though from excess of caution he should sometimes do
this without any real necessity, yet all the inconveniencies which his
crew can thereby suffer are inconsiderable, in comparison of the danger,
 misery, and ruin, to which they might sometimes be exposed by a less
provident conduct. Though from excess of avarice, in the same manner,
the inland corn merchant should sometimes raise the price of his corn
somewhat higher than the scarcity of the season requires, yet all the
inconveniencies which the people can suffer from this conduct, which
effectually secures them from a famine in the end of the season, are
inconsiderable, in comparison of what they might have been exposed to by
 a more liberal way of dealing in the beginning of it. The corn merchant
 himself is likely to suffer the most by this excess of avarice; not
only from the indignation which it generally excites against him, but,
though he should escape the effects of this indignation, from the
quantity of corn which it necessarily leaves upon his hands in the end
of the season, and which, if the next season happens to prove
favourable, he must always sell for a much lower price than he might
otherwise have had.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_102"><span class="type-margin"><span>The interest
of a monopoly might perhaps be to destroy a portion of the crop, but
corn cannot be monopolised where the trade is free</span></span>Were it
possible, indeed, for one great company of merchants to possess
themselves of the whole crop of an extensive country, it might, perhaps,
 be their interest to deal with it as the Dutch are said to do with the
spiceries of the Moluccas, to destroy or throw away a considerable part
of it, in order to keep up the price of the rest.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt072" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt072_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 But it is scarce possible, even by the violence of law, to establish
such an extensive monopoly with regard to corn; and, wherever the law
leaves the trade free, it is of all commodities the least liable to be
engrossed or monopolized by the force of a few large capitals, which buy
 up the greater part of it. Not only its value far exceeds what the
capitals of a few private men are capable of purchasing, but supposing
they were <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>27<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 capable of purchasing it, the manner in which it is produced renders
this purchase altogether impracticable. As in every civilized country it
 is the commodity of which the annual consumption is the greatest, so a
greater quantity of industry is annually employed in producing corn than
 in producing any other commodity. When it first comes from the ground
too, it is necessarily divided among a greater number of owners than any
 other commodity; and these owners can never be collected into one place
 like a number of independent manufacturers, but are necessarily
scattered through all the different corners of the country. These first
owners either immediately supply the consumers in their own
neighbourhood, or they supply other inland dealers who supply those
consumers. The inland dealers in corn, therefore, including both the
farmer and the baker, are necessarily more numerous than the dealers in
any other commodity, and their dispersed situation renders it altogether
 impossible for them to enter into any general combination. If in a year
 of scarcity therefore, any of them should find that he had a good deal
more corn upon hand than, at the current price, he could hope to dispose
 of before the end of the season, he would never think of keeping up
this price to his own loss, and to the sole benefit of his rivals and
competitors, but would immediately lower it, in order to get rid of his
corn before the new crop began to come in. The same motives, the same
interests, which would thus regulate the conduct of any one dealer,
would regulate that of every other, and oblige them all in general to
sell their corn at the price which, according to the best of their
judgment, was most suitable to the scarcity or plenty of the season.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_103"><span class="type-margin"><span>Dearths are
never occasioned by combination, but always by scarcity and famines are
always caused by the supposed remedies for dearths applied by
government.</span></span>Whoever examines, with attention, the history
of the dearths and famines which have afflicted any part of Europe,
during either the course of the present or that of the two preceding
centuries, of several of which we have pretty exact accounts, will find,
 I believe, that a dearth never has arisen from any combination among
the inland dealers in corn, nor from any other cause but a real
scarcity, occasioned sometimes, perhaps, and in some particular places,
by the waste of war, but in by far the greatest number of cases, by the
fault of the seasons; and that a famine has never arisen from any other
cause but the violence of government attempting, by improper means, to
remedy the inconveniencies of a dearth.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_104">In an extensive corn country, between all the different parts of<span class="type-margin"><span>Scarcities are never great enough to cause famine.</span></span>
 which there is a free commerce and communication, the scarcity
occasioned by the most unfavourable seasons can never be so great as to
produce a famine; and the scantiest crop, if managed with frugality <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>28<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 and œconomy, will maintain, through the year, the same number of people
 that are commonly fed in a more affluent manner by one of moderate
plenty. The seasons most unfavourable to the crop are those of excessive
 drought or excessive rain. But, as corn grows equally upon high and low
 lands, upon grounds that are disposed to be too wet, and upon those
that are disposed to be too dry, either the drought or the rain which is
 hurtful to one part of the country is favourable to another; and though
 both in the wet and in the dry season the crop is a good deal less than
 in one more properly tempered, yet in both what is lost in one part of
the country is in some measure compensated by what is gained in the
other. In rice countries, where the crop not only requires a very moist
soil, but where in a certain period of its growing it must be laid under
 water, the effects of a drought are much more dismal. Even in such
countries, however, the drought is, perhaps, scarce ever so universal,
as necessarily to occasion a famine, if the government would allow a
free trade. The drought in Bengal, a few years ago, might probably have
occasioned a very great dearth. Some improper regulations, some
injudicious restraints imposed by the servants of the East India Company
 upon the rice trade, contributed, perhaps, to turn that dearth into a
famine.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_105"><span class="type-margin"><span>Governments cause famines by ordering corn to be sold at a reasonable price.</span></span>When
 the government, in order to remedy the inconveniencies of a dearth,
orders all the dealers to sell their corn at what it supposes a
reasonable price, it either hinders them from bringing it to market,
which may sometimes produce a famine even in the beginning of the
season; or if they bring it thither, it enables the people, and thereby
encourages them to consume it so fast, as must necessarily produce a
famine before the end of the season. The unlimited, unrestrained freedom
 of the corn trade, as it is the only effectual preventative of the
miseries of a famine, so it is the best palliative of the
inconveniencies of a dearth; for the inconveniencies of a real scarcity
cannot be remedied; they can only be palliated. No trade deserves more
the full protection of the law, and no trade requires it so much;
because no trade is so much exposed to popular odium.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_106"><span class="type-margin"><span>The corn merchant is odious to the populace,</span></span>In
 years of scarcity the inferior ranks of people impute their distress to
 the avarice of the corn merchant, who becomes the object of their
hatred and indignation. Instead of making profit upon such occasions,
therefore, he is often in danger of being utterly ruined, and of having
his magazines plundered and destroyed by their violence. It is in years
of scarcity, however, when prices are high, that the corn merchant
expects to make his principal profit. He is generally in contract with
some farmers to furnish him for a certain number of years with <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>29<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 a certain quantity of corn at a certain price. This contract price is
settled according to what is supposed to be the moderate and reasonable,
 that is, the ordinary or average price, which, before the late years of
 scarcity, was commonly about eight-and-twenty shillings for the quarter
 of wheat, and for that of other grain in proportion. In years of
scarcity, therefore, the corn merchant buys a great part of his corn for
 the ordinary price, and sells it for a much higher. That this
extraordinary profit, however, is no more than sufficient to put his
trade upon a fair level with other trades, and to compensate the many
losses which he sustains upon other occasions, both from the perishable
nature of the commodity itself, and from the frequent and unforeseen
fluctuations of its price, seems evident enough, from this single
circumstance, that great fortunes are as seldom made in this as in any
other trade. The popular odium, however, which attends it in years of<span class="type-margin"><span>and this deters respectable people from entering the trade.</span></span>
 scarcity, the only years in which it can be very profitable, renders
people of character and fortune averse to enter into it. It is abandoned
 to an inferior set of dealers; and millers, bakers, mealmen, and meal
factors, together with a number of wretched hucksters, are almost the
only middle people that, in the home market, come between the grower and
 the consumer.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_107">The ancient policy of Europe, instead of discountenancing this<span class="type-margin"><span>This popular odium was encouraged by legislation.</span></span> popular odium against a trade so beneficial to the public, seems, on the contrary, to have authorised and encouraged it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_108">By the 5th and 6th of Edward VI. cap. 14. it was enacted, That whoever should buy any corn or grain<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt073" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt073_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 with intent to sell it again, should be reputed an unlawful engrosser,
and should, for the first fault suffer two months imprisonment, and
forfeit the value of the corn; for the second, suffer six months
imprisonment, and forfeit double the value; and for the third, be set in
 the pillory, suffer imprisonment during the king’s pleasure, and
forfeit all his goods and chattels. The ancient policy of most other
parts of Europe was no better than that of England.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_109">Our ancestors seem to have imagined that the people would buy<span class="type-margin"><span>Many restraints were imposed on traders.</span></span>
 their corn cheaper of the farmer than of the corn merchant, who, they
were afraid, would require, over and above the price which he paid to
the farmer, an exorbitant profit to himself. They endeavoured,
therefore, to annihilate his trade altogether. They even endeavoured to
hinder as much as possible any middle man of any kind from coming <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>30<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 in between the grower and the consumer; and this was the meaning of the
 many restraints which they imposed upon the trade of those whom they
called kidders or carriers of corn, a trade which nobody was allowed to
exercise without a licence ascertaining his qualifications as a man of
probity and fair dealing.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt074" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt074_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The authority of three justices of the peace was, by the statute of
Edward VI. necessary, in order to grant this licence. But even this
restraint was afterwards thought insufficient, and by a statute of
Elizabeth,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt075" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt075_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> the privilege of granting it was confined to the quarter-sessions.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_110"><span class="type-margin"><span>Endeavours were made to force the farmers to be retailers, though manufacturers were forbidden to be so.</span></span>The
 ancient policy of Europe endeavoured in this manner to regulate
agriculture, the great trade of the country, by maxims quite different
from those which it established with regard to manufactures, the great
trade of the towns. By leaving the farmer no other customers but either
the consumers or their immediate factors,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt076" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt076_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 the kidders and carriers of corn, it endeavoured to force him to
exercise the trade, not only of a farmer, but of a corn merchant or corn
 retailer. On the contrary, it in many cases prohibited the manufacturer
 from exercising the trade of a shopkeeper, or from selling his own
goods by retail. It meant by the one law to promote the general interest
 of the country, or to render corn cheap, without, perhaps, its being
well understood how this was to be done. By the other it meant to
promote that of a particular order of men, the shopkeepers, who would be
 so much undersold by the manufacturer, it was supposed, that their
trade would be ruined if he was allowed to retail at all.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_111">The manufacturer, however, though he had been
allowed to keep a shop, and to sell his own goods by retail, could not
have undersold the common shopkeeper. Whatever part of his capital he
might have placed in his shop, he must have withdrawn it from his
manufacture. In order to carry on his business on a level with that of
other people, as he must have had the profit of a manufacturer on the
one part, so he must have had that of a shopkeeper upon the other. Let
us suppose, for example, that in the particular town where he lived, ten
 per cent. was the ordinary profit both of manufacturing and shopkeeping
 stock; he must in this case have charged upon every piece of his own
goods <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>31<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 which he sold in his shop, a profit of twenty per cent. When he carried
 them from his workhouse to his shop, he must have valued them at the
price for which he could have sold them to a dealer or shopkeeper, who
would have bought them by wholesale. If he valued them lower, he lost a
part of the profit of his manufacturing capital. When again he sold them
 from his shop, unless he got the same price at which a shopkeeper would
 have sold them, he lost a part of the profit of his shopkeeping
capital. Though he might appear, therefore, to make a double profit upon
 the same piece of goods, yet as these goods made successively a part of
 two distinct capitals, he made but a single profit upon the whole
capital employed about them; and if he made less than this profit, he
was a loser, or did not employ his whole capital with the same advantage
 as the greater part of his neighbours.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_112">What the manufacturer was prohibited to do,
the farmer was in some measure enjoined to do; to divide his capital
between two different employments; to keep one part of it in his
granaries and stack yard, for supplying the occasional demands of the
market; and to employ the other in the cultivation of his land. But as
he could not afford to employ the latter for less than the ordinary
profits of farming stock, so he could as little afford to employ the
former for less than the ordinary profits of mercantile stock. Whether
the stock which really carried on the business of the corn merchant
belonged to the person who was called a farmer, or to the person who was
 called a corn merchant, an equal profit was in both cases requisite, in
 order to indemnify its owner for employing it in this manner; in order
to put his business upon a level with other trades, and in order to
hinder him from having an interest to change it as soon as possible for
some other. The farmer, therefore, who was thus forced to exercise the
trade of a corn merchant, could not afford to sell his corn cheaper than
 any other corn merchant would have been obliged to do in the case of a
free competition.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_113">The dealer who can employ his whole stock in one single branch of<span class="type-margin"><span>The dealer confined to one branch of business can sell cheaper.</span></span>
 business, has an advantage of the same kind with the workman who can
employ his whole labour in one single operation. As the latter acquires a
 dexterity which enables him, with the same two hands, to perform a much
 greater quantity of work; so the former acquires so easy and ready a
method of transacting his business, of buying and disposing of his
goods, that with the same capital he can transact a much greater
quantity of business. As the one can commonly afford his work a good
deal cheaper, so the other can commonly afford his <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>32<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 goods somewhat cheaper than if his stock and attention were both
employed about a greater variety of objects. The greater part of
manufacturers could not afford to retail their own goods so cheap as a
vigilant and active shopkeeper, whose sole business it was to buy them
by wholesale, and to retail them again. The greater part of farmers
could still less afford to retail their own corn, to supply the
inhabitants of a town, at perhaps four or five miles distance from the
greater part of them, so cheap as a vigilant and active corn merchant,
whose sole business it was to purchase corn by wholesale, to collect it
into a great magazine, and to retail it again.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_114"><span class="type-margin"><span>Laws
preventing the manufacturer from being a shopkeeper and compelling the
farmer to be a corn merchant were both impolitic and unjust, but the
latter was the most pernicious.</span></span>The law which prohibited
the manufacturer from exercising the trade of a shopkeeper, endeavoured
to force this division in the employment of stock to go on faster than
it might otherwise have done. The law which obliged the farmer to
exercise the trade of a corn merchant, endeavoured to hinder it from
going on so fast. Both laws were evident violations of natural liberty,
and therefore unjust; and they were both too as impolitic as they were
unjust. It is the interest of every society, that things of this kind
should never either be forced or obstructed. The man who employs either
his labour or his stock in a greater variety of ways than his situation
renders necessary, can never hurt his neighbour by underselling him. He
may hurt himself, and he generally does so. Jack of all trades will
never be rich, says the proverb. But the law ought always to trust
people with the care of their own interest, as in their local situations
 they must generally be able to judge better of it than the legislator
can do. The law, however, which obliged the farmer to exercise the trade
 of a corn merchant, was by far the most pernicious of the two.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_115"><span class="type-margin"><span>by obstructing the improvement of land.</span></span>It
 obstructed not only that division in the employment of stock which is
so advantageous to every society, but it obstructed likewise the
improvement and cultivation of the land. By obliging the farmer to carry
 on two trades instead of one, it forced him to divide his capital into
two parts, of which one only could be employed in cultivation. But if he
 had been at liberty to sell his whole crop to a corn merchant as fast
as he could thresh it out, his whole capital might have returned
immediately to the land, and have been employed in buying more cattle,
and hiring more servants, in order to improve and cultivate it better.
But by being obliged to sell his corn by retail, he was obliged to keep a
 great part of his capital in his granaries and stack yard through the
year, and could not, therefore, cultivate so well as with the same
capital he might otherwise have done. This law, therefore, necessarily
obstructed the improvement of the land, and, instead of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>33<span class="bracket">]</span></span> tending to render corn cheaper, must have tended to render it scarcer, and therefore dearer, than it would otherwise have been.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_116"><span class="type-margin"><span>Corn merchants support the farmers just as wholesale dealers support the manufacturers.</span></span>After
 the business of the farmer, that of the corn merchant is in reality the
 trade which, if properly protected and encouraged, would contribute the
 most to the raising of corn. It would support the trade of the farmer,
in the same manner as the trade of the wholesale dealer supports that of
 the manufacturer.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_117"><span class="type-margin"><span>Wholesale dealers allow manufacturers to devote their whole capital to manufacturing.</span></span>The
 wholesale dealer, by affording a ready market to the manufacturer, by
taking his goods off his hand as fast as he can make them, and by
sometimes even advancing their price to him before he has made them,
enables him to keep his whole capital, and sometimes even more than his
whole capital, constantly employed in manufacturing, and consequently to
 manufacture a much greater quantity of goods than if he was obliged to
dispose of them himself to the immediate consumers, or even to the
retailers. As the capital of the wholesale merchant too is generally
sufficient to replace that of many manufacturers, this intercourse
between him and them interests the owner of a large capital to support
the owners of a great number of small ones, and to assist them in those
losses and misfortunes which might otherwise prove ruinous to them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_118">An intercourse of the same kind universally established between the<span class="type-margin"><span>So corn merchants should allow farmers to devote their whole capital to cultivation.</span></span>
 farmers and the corn merchants, would be attended with effects equally
beneficial to the farmers. They would be enabled to keep their whole
capitals, and even more than their whole capitals, constantly employed
in cultivation. In case of any of those accidents, to which no trade is
more liable than theirs, they would find in their ordinary customer, the
 wealthy corn merchant, a person who had both an interest to support
them, and the ability to do it, and they would not, as at present, be
entirely dependent upon the forbearance of their landlord, or the mercy
of his steward. Were it possible, as perhaps it is not, to establish
this intercourse universally, and all at once, were it possible to turn
all at once the whole farming stock of the kingdom to its proper
business, the cultivation of land, withdrawing it from every other
employment into which any part of it may be at present diverted, and
were it possible, in order to support and assist upon occasion the
operations of this great stock, to provide all at once another stock
almost equally great, it is not perhaps very easy to imagine how great,
how extensive, and how sudden would be the improvement which this change
 of circumstances would alone produce upon the whole face of the
country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_119">The statute of Edward VI., therefore, by prohibiting as much as<span class="type-margin"><span>Accordingly
 the statute of Edward VI. endeavoured to annihilate a trade which is
the best palliative and preventative of a dearth.</span></span> possible any middle man from coming in between the grower and the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>34<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 consumer, endeavoured to annihilate a trade, of which the free exercise
 is not only the best palliative of the inconveniencies of a dearth, but
 the best preventative of that calamity: after the trade of the farmer,
no trade contributing so much to the growing of corn as that of the corn
 merchant.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_120"><span class="type-margin"><span>Its provisions were moderated by later statutes down to 15 Car II., c. 7.</span></span>The
 rigour of this law was afterwards softened by several subsequent
statutes, which successively permitted the engrossing of corn when the
price of wheat should not exceed twenty, twenty-four, thirty-two, and
forty shillings the quarter.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt077" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt077_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 At last, by the 15th of Charles II. c. 7, the engrossing or buying of
corn in order to sell it again, as long as the price of wheat did not
exceed forty-eight shillings the quarter, and that of other grain in
proportion, was declared lawful to all persons not being forestallers,
that is, not selling again in the same market within three months.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt078" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt078_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 All the freedom which the trade of the inland corn dealer has ever yet
enjoyed, was bestowed upon it by this statute. The statute of the
twelfth of the present king, which repeals almost all the other ancient
laws against engrossers and forestallers, does not repeal the
restrictions of this particular statute, which therefore still continue
in force.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt079" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt079_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_121"><span class="type-margin"><span>which is absurd, as it supposes,</span></span>This statute, however, authorises in some measure two very absurd popular prejudices.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_122"><span class="type-margin"><span>(1) that engrossing is likely to be hurtful after a certain price has been reached,</span></span>First,
 it supposes that when the price of wheat has risen so high as
forty-eight shillings the quarter, and that of other grain in
proportion, corn is likely to be so engrossed as to hurt the people. But
 from what has been already said, it seems evident enough that corn can
at no price be so engrossed by the inland dealers as to hurt the people:
 and forty-eight shillings the quarter besides, though it may be
considered as a very high price, yet in years of scarcity it is a price
which frequently takes place immediately after harvest, when scarce any
part of the new crop can be sold off, and when it is impossible even for
 ignorance to suppose that any part of it can be so engrossed as to hurt
 the people.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_123"><span class="type-margin"><span>(2) that forestalling is likely to be hurtful after a certain price has been reached.</span></span>Secondly,
 it supposes that there is a certain price at which corn is likely to be
 forestalled, that is, bought up in order to be sold again soon after in
 the same market, so as to hurt the people. But if a merchant <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>35<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 ever buys up corn, either going to a particular market or in a
particular market, in order to sell it again soon after in the same
market, it must be because he judges that the market cannot be so
liberally supplied through the whole season as upon that particular
occasion, and that the price, therefore, must soon rise. If he judges
wrong in this, and if the price does not rise, he not only loses the
whole profit of the stock which he employs in this manner, but a part of
 the stock itself, by the expence and loss which necessarily attend<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt080" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt080_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 the storing and keeping of corn. He hurts himself, therefore, much more
 essentially than he can hurt even the particular people whom he may
hinder from supplying themselves upon that particular market day,
because they may afterwards supply themselves just as cheap upon any
other market day. If he judges right, instead of hurting the great body
of the people, he renders them a most important service. By making them
feel the inconveniencies of a dearth somewhat earlier than they
otherwise might do, he prevents their feeling them afterwards so
severely as they certainly would do, if the cheapness of price
encouraged them to consume faster than suited the real scarcity of the
season. When the scarcity is real, the best thing that can be done for
the people is to divide the inconveniencies of it as equally as possible
 through all the different months, and weeks, and days of the year. The
interest of the corn merchant makes him study to do this as exactly as
he can: and as no other person can have either the same interest, or the
 same knowledge, or the same abilities to do it so exactly as he, this
most important operation of commerce ought to be trusted entirely to
him; or, in other words, the corn trade, so far at least as concerns the
 supply of the home market, ought to be left perfectly free.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_124">The popular fear of engrossing and forestalling may be compared<span class="type-margin"><span>The fear of engrossing and forestalling is as groundless as that of witchcraft.</span></span>
 to the popular terrors and suspicions of witchcraft. The unfortunate
wretches accused of this latter crime were not more innocent of the
misfortunes imputed to them, than those who have been accused of the
former. The law which put an end to all prosecutions against witchcraft,
 which put it out of any man’s power to gratify his own malice by
accusing his neighbour of that imaginary crime, seems effectually to
have put an end to those fears and suspicions, by taking away the great
cause which encouraged and supported them. The law which should restore
entire freedom to the inland trade of corn, would probably prove as
effectual to put an end to the popular fears of engrossing and
forestalling.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>36<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_125"><span class="type-margin"><span>Still, the 15 Car. II., c. 7, is the best of the corn laws, as it gives the inland corn trade all the freedom it possesses,</span></span>The
 15th of Charles II. c. 7, however, with all its imperfections, has
perhaps contributed more both to the plentiful supply of the home
market, and to the increase of tillage, than any other law in the
statute book. It is from this law that the inland corn trade has derived
 all the liberty and protection which it has ever yet enjoyed; and both
the supply of the home market, and the interest of tillage, are much
more effectually promoted by the inland, than either by the importation
or exportation trade.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_126"><span class="type-margin"><span>The inland trade is much more important than the foreign.</span></span>The
 proportion of the average quantity of all sorts of grain imported into
Great Britain to that of all sorts of grain consumed, it has been
computed by the author of the tracts upon the corn trade, does not
exceed that of one to five hundred and seventy. For supplying the home
market, therefore, the importance of the inland trade must be to that of
 the importation trade as five hundred and seventy to one.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt081" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt081_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_127">The average quantity of all sorts of grain
exported from Great Britain does not, according to the same author,
exceed the one-and-thirtieth part of the annual produce.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt082" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt082_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 For the encouragement of tillage, therefore, by providing a market for
the home produce, the importance of the inland trade must be to that of
the exportation trade as thirty to one.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_128">I have no great faith in political arithmetic,
 and I mean not to warrant the exactness of either of these
computations. I mention them only in order to show of how much less
consequence, in the opinion of the most judicious and experienced
persons, the foreign trade of corn is than the home trade. The great
cheapness of corn in the years immediately preceding the establishment
of the bounty, may perhaps, with reason, be ascribed in some measure to
the operation of this statute of Charles II., which had been enacted
about five-and twenty years before, and which had therefore full time to
 produce its effect.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_129">A very few words will sufficiently explain all that I have to say concerning the other three branches of the corn trade.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_130"><span class="type-margin"><span><span id="lf0206-02_label_801">II.</span> The Importer, whose trade benefits the people and does not really hurt the farmers and country gentlemen</span></span><span id="lf0206-02_label_116">II.</span>
 The trade of the merchant importer of foreign corn for home
consumption, evidently contributes to the immediate supply of the home
market, and must so far be immediately beneficial to the great body of
the people. It tends, indeed, to lower somewhat the average money price
of corn, but not to diminish its real value, or the quantity <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>37<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of labour which it is capable of maintaining. If importation was at all
 times free, our farmers and country gentlemen would, probably, one year
 with another, get less money for their corn than they do at present,
when importation is at most times in effect prohibited; but the money
which they got would be of more value, would buy more goods of all other
 kinds, and would employ more labour. Their real wealth, their real
revenue, therefore, would be the same as at present, though it might be
expressed by a smaller quantity of silver; and they would neither be
disabled nor discouraged from cultivating corn as much as they do at
present. On the contrary, as the rise in the real value of silver, in
consequence of lowering the money price of corn, lowers somewhat the
money price of all other commodities, it gives the industry of the
country, where it takes place, some advantage in all foreign markets,
and thereby tends to encourage and increase that industry. But the
extent of the home market for corn must be in proportion to the general
industry of the country where it grows, or to the number of those who
produce something else, and therefore have something else, or what comes
 to the same thing, the price of something else, to give in exchange for
 corn. But in every country the home market, as it is the nearest and
most convenient, so is it likewise the greatest and most important
market for corn. That rise in the real value of silver, therefore, which
 is the effect of lowering the average money price of corn, tends to
enlarge the greatest and most important market for corn, and thereby to
encourage, instead of discouraging, its growth.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_131">By the 22d of Charles II. c. 13, the importation of wheat, whenever<span class="type-margin"><span>The Act of 2 Car. II., c. 13, imposed very high duties on importation</span></span>
 the price in the home market did not exceed fifty-three shillings and
four pence the quarter, was subjected to a duty of sixteen shillings the
 quarter; and to a duty of eight shillings whenever the price did not
exceed four pounds.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt083" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt083_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The former of these two prices has, for more than a century past, taken
 place only in times of very great scarcity; and the latter has, so far
as I know, not taken place at all. Yet, till wheat had risen above this
latter price, it was by this statute subjected to a very high duty; and,
 till it had risen above the former, to a <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>38<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 duty which amounted to a prohibition. The importation of other sorts of
 grain was restrained at rates, and by duties, in proportion to the
value of the grain, almost equally<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt084" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt084_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> high.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt085" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt085_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> Subsequent laws still further increased those duties.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>39<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_132">The distress which, in years of scarcity, the strict execution of those<span class="type-margin"><span>but its operation was generally suspended in years of scarcity.</span></span> laws might have brought<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt086" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt086_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 upon the people, would probably have been very great. But, upon such
occasions, its execution was generally suspended by temporary statutes,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt087" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt087_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 which permitted, for a limited time, the importation of foreign corn.
The necessity of these temporary statutes sufficiently demonstrates the
impropriety of this general one.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_133">These restraints upon importation, though prior to the establishment<span class="type-margin"><span>Restraint was necessary on account of the bounty.</span></span>
 of the bounty, were dictated by the same spirit, by the same
principles, which afterwards enacted that regulation. How hurtful soever
 in themselves, these or some other restraints upon importation became
necessary in consequence of that regulation. If, when wheat was either
below forty-eight shillings the quarter, or not much above it, foreign
corn could have been imported either duty free, or upon paying only a
small duty, it might have been exported again, with the benefit of the
bounty, to the great loss of the public revenue, and to the entire
perversion of the institution, of which the object was to extend the

 certainly does not contribute directly to the plentiful supply of the
home market. It does so, however, indirectly. From whatever source this
supply may be usually drawn, whether from home growth or from foreign
importation, unless more corn is either usually grown, or usually
imported into the country, than what is usually consumed in it, the
supply of the home market can never be very plentiful. But unless the
surplus can, in all ordinary cases, be exported, the growers will be
careful never to grow more, and the importers never to import more, than
 what the bare consumption of the home market requires. That market will
 very seldom be overstocked; but it will generally be understocked, the
people, whose business it is to supply it, being generally afraid lest
their goods should be left upon their hands. The prohibition of
exportation limits the improvement and cultivation of the country to
what the supply of its own inhabitants requires. The freedom of
exportation enables it to extend cultivation<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt088" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt088_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> for the supply of foreign nations.</p>

<p id="Smith_0206-02_135"><span class="type-margin"><span>Liberty of exportation was made complete in 1700,</span></span>By
 the 12th of Charles II. c. 4. the exportation of corn was permitted
whenever the price of wheat did not exceed forty shillings the quarter,
and that of other grain in proportion.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt089" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt089_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> By the 15th of the same prince,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt090" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt090_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> this liberty was extended till the price of wheat exceeded forty-eight shillings the quarter; and by the 22d,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt091" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt091_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 to all higher prices. A poundage, indeed, was to be paid to the king
upon such exportation. But all grain was rated so low in the book of
rates, that this poundage amounted only upon wheat to a shilling, upon
oats to four pence, and upon all other grain to six pence the quarter.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt092" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt092_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> By the 1st of William and Mary,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt093" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt093_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a>
 the act which established the bounty, this small duty was virtually
taken off whenever the price of wheat did not exceed forty-eight
shillings the quarter; and by the 11th and 12th of William III. c. 20.
it was expressly taken off at all higher prices.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_136">The trade of the merchant exporter was, in
this manner, not only encouraged by a bounty, but rendered much more
free than that of the inland dealer. By the last of these statutes, corn
 could be engrossed at any price for exportation; but it could not be
engrossed for inland sale, except when the price did not exceed
forty-eight shillings the<span class="type-margin"><span>though the interest of the exporter sometimes differs from that of the people of his country.</span></span> quarter.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt094" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt094_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">6</a>
 The interest of the inland dealer, however, it has already been shown,
can never be opposite to that of the great body of the people. That of
the merchant exporter may, and in fact sometimes is. If, while his own
country labours under a dearth, a neighbouring country should be
afflicted with a famine, it might be his interest to carry corn to the
latter country in such quantities as might very much aggravate the
calamities of the dearth. The plentiful supply of the home market was
not the direct object of those statutes; but, under the pretence of
encouraging agriculture, to raise the money price of corn as high as
possible, and thereby to occasion, as much as possible, a constant
dearth in the home market. By the discouragement of importation, the
supply of that market, even in times of great scarcity, was confined to
the home growth; and by the encouragement of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>41<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 exportation, when the price was so high as forty-eight shillings the
quarter, that market was not, even in times of considerable scarcity,
allowed to enjoy the whole of that growth. The temporary laws,
prohibiting for a limited time the exportation of corn, and taking off
for a limited time the duties upon its importation, expedients to which
Great Britain has been obliged so frequently to have recourse,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt095" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt095_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 sufficiently demonstrate the impropriety of her general system. Had
that system been good, she would not so frequently have been reduced to
the necessity of departing from it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_137">Were all nations to follow the liberal system of free exportation and<span class="type-margin"><span>The bad policy of some great countries may sometimes render it necessary for small countries to restrain exportation</span></span>
 free importation, the different states into which a great continent was
 divided would so far resemble the different provinces of a great
empire. As among the different provinces of a great empire the freedom
of the inland trade appears, both from reason and experience, not only
the best palliative of a dearth, but the most effectual preventative of a
 famine; so would the freedom of the exportation and importation trade
be among the different states into which a great continent was divided.
The larger the continent, the easier the communication through all the
different parts of it, both by land and by water, the less would any one
 particular part of it ever be exposed to either of these calamities,
the scarcity of any one country being more likely to be relieved by the
plenty of some other. But very few countries have entirely adopted this
liberal system. The freedom of the corn trade is almost every where more
 or less restrained, and, in many countries, is confined by such absurd
regulations, as frequently aggravate the unavoidable misfortune of a
dearth, into the dreadful calamity of a famine. The demand of such
countries for corn may frequently become so great and so urgent, that a
small state in their neighbourhood, which happened at the same time to
be labouring under some degree of dearth, could not venture to supply
them without exposing itself to the like dreadful calamity. The very bad
 policy of one country may thus render it in some measure dangerous and
imprudent to establish what would otherwise be the best policy in
another. The unlimited freedom of exportation, however, would be much
less dangerous in great states, in which the growth being much greater,
the supply could seldom be much affected by any quantity of corn that
was likely to be exported. In a Swiss canton, or in some of the little
states of Italy, it may, perhaps, sometimes be necessary to restrain the
 exportation of corn. In such great countries as France or England it
scarce ever can. To <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>42<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 hinder, besides, the farmer from sending his goods at all times to the
best market, is evidently to sacrifice the ordinary laws of justice to
an idea of public utility, to a sort of reasons of state; an act of
legislative authority which ought to be exercised only, which can be
pardoned only in cases of the most urgent necessity. The price at which
the exportation of corn is prohibited, if it is ever to be prohibited,
ought always to be a very high price.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_138"><span class="type-margin"><span>The corn laws are like the laws on religion.</span></span>The
 laws concerning corn may every where be compared to the laws concerning
 religion. The people feel themselves so much interested in what relates
 either to their subsistence in this life, or to their happiness in a
life to come, that government must yield to their prejudices, and, in
order to preserve the public tranquillity, establish that system which
they approve of. It is upon this account, perhaps, that we so seldom
find a reasonable system established with regard to either of those two
capital objects.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_139"><span class="type-margin"><span><span id="lf0206-02_label_132">IV.</span> The Merchant Carrier, whose trade contributes to the plentiful supply of the home market.</span></span><span id="lf0206-02_label_802">IV.</span>
 The trade of the merchant carrier, or of the importer of foreign corn
in order to export it again, contributes to the plentiful supply of the
home market. It is not indeed the direct purpose of his trade to sell
his corn there. But he will generally be willing to do so, and even for a
 good deal less money than he might expect in a foreign market; because
he saves in this manner the expence of loading and unloading, of freight
 and insurance. The inhabitants of the country which, by means of the
carrying trade, becomes the magazine and storehouse for the supply of
other countries, can very seldom be in want themselves. Though the
carrying trade might thus contribute to reduce the average money price
of corn in the home market, it would not thereby lower its real value.
It would only raise somewhat the real value of silver.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_140"><span class="type-margin"><span>British law in effect prohibited the carrying trade in corn.</span></span>The
 carrying trade was in effect prohibited in Great Britain, upon all
ordinary occasions, by the high duties upon the importation of foreign
corn, of the greater part of which there was no drawback<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt096" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt096_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>;
 and upon extraordinary occasions, when a scarcity made it necessary to
suspend those duties by temporary statutes, exportation was always
prohibited. By this system of laws, therefore, the carrying trade was in
 effect prohibited upon all occasions.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_141"><span class="type-margin"><span>The prosperity of Great Britain is not due to the corn bounty, but to the security of enjoying the fruits of labour.</span></span>That
 system of laws, therefore, which is connected with the establishment of
 the bounty, seems to deserve no part of the praise which has been
bestowed upon it. The improvement and prosperity of Great Britain, which
 has been so often ascribed to those laws, may very easily be accounted
for by other causes. That security which the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>43<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 laws in Great Britain give to every man that he shall enjoy the fruits
of his own labour, is alone sufficient to make any country flourish,
notwithstanding these and twenty other absurd regulations of commerce;
and this security was perfected by the revolution, much about the same
time that the bounty was established. The natural effort of every
individual to better his own condition, when suffered to exert itself
with freedom and security, is so powerful a principle, that it is alone,
 and without any assistance, not only capable of carrying on the society
 to wealth and prosperity, but of surmounting a hundred impertinent
obstructions with which the folly of human laws too often incumbers its
operations; though the effect of these obstructions is always more or
less either to encroach upon its freedom, or to diminish its security.
In Great Britain industry is perfectly secure; and though it is far from
 being perfectly free, it is as free or freer than in any other part of
Europe.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_142">Though the period of the greatest prosperity and improvement of<span class="type-margin"><span>That the greatest prosperity has been subsequent proves nothing.</span></span>
 Great Britain, has been posterior to that system of laws which is
connected with the bounty, we must not upon that account impute it to
those laws. It has been posterior likewise to the national debt. But the
 national debt has most assuredly not been the cause of it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_143">Though the system of laws which is connected with the bounty, has<span class="type-margin"><span>Spain
 and Portugal are poorer than Great Britain because their bad policy is
more effectual, and not counteracted by general liberty and security.</span></span>
 exactly the same tendency with the police of Spain and Portugal; to
lower somewhat the value of the precious metals in the country where it
takes place;<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt097" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt097_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 yet Great Britain is certainly one of the richest countries in Europe,
while Spain and Portugal are perhaps among the most beggarly. This
difference of situation, however, may easily be accounted for from two
different causes. First, the tax in Spain, the prohibition in Portugal
of exporting gold and silver,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt098" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt098_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 and the vigilant police which watches over the execution of those laws,
 must, in two very poor countries, which between them import annually
upwards of six millions sterling,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt099" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt099_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 operate, not only more directly, but much more forcibly in reducing the
 value of those metals there, than the corn laws can do in Great
Britain. And, secondly, this bad policy is not in those countries
counter-balanced by the general liberty and security of the people.
Industry is there neither free nor secure, and the civil and
ecclesiastical governments of both Spain and Portugal, are such as would
 alone be sufficient to perpetuate their present state of poverty, even
though their regulations of commerce were as wise as the greater part of
 them are absurd and foolish.</p>

 of them a small duty is imposed of only six-pence upon the quarter of
wheat, and upon that of other grain in proportion. With regard to all
these different sorts of grain, but particularly with regard to wheat,
the home market is thus opened to foreign supplies at prices
considerably lower than before.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt102" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt102_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_146"><span class="type-margin"><span>stops the bounty earlier,</span></span>By
 the same statute the old bounty of five shillings upon the exportation
of wheat ceases so soon as the price rises to forty-four shillings the
quarter, instead of forty-eight, the price at which it ceased before;
that of two shillings and six-pence upon the exportation of barley
ceases so soon as the price rises to twenty-two shillings, instead of
twenty-four, the price at which it ceased before; that of two shillings
and six-pence upon the exportation of oatmeal ceases so soon as the
price rises to fourteen shillings, instead of fifteen, the price at
which it ceased before. The bounty upon rye is reduced from three
shillings and six-pence to three shillings, and it ceases so soon as the
 price rises to twenty-eight shillings, instead of thirty-two, the price
 at which it ceased before.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt103" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt103_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>

the sooner they cease, and the lower they are, so much the better.</p>

 for the exportation of oats whenever the price does not exceed fourteen
 shillings. No bounty had ever been given before for the exportation of
this grain, no more than for that of peas or beans.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt106" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt106_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>

 as the price rises to forty-four shillings the quarter; that of rye so
soon as it rises to twenty-eight shillings; that of barley so soon as it
 rises to twenty-two shillings; and that of oats so soon as they rise to
 fourteen shillings. Those several prices seem all of them a good deal
too low, and there seems to be an impropriety, besides, in prohibiting
exportation altogether at those precise prices at which that bounty,
which was given in order to force it, is withdrawn.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt107" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt107_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>

<h2 id="lf0206-02_label_146">CHAPTER VI: OF TREATIES OF COMMERCE</h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-02_152"><span class="type-margin"><span>Treaties of commerce are advantageous to the favoured,</span></span>WHEN
 a nation binds itself by treaty either to permit the entry of certain
goods from one foreign country which it prohibits from all others, or to
 exempt the goods of one country from duties to which it subjects those
of all others, the country, or at least the merchants and manufacturers
of the country, whose commerce is so favoured, must necessarily derive
great advantage from the treaty. Those merchants and manufacturers enjoy
 a sort of monopoly in the country which is so indulgent to them. That
country becomes a market both more extensive and more advantageous for
their goods: more extensive, because the goods of other nations being
either excluded or subjected to heavier duties, it takes off a greater
quantity of theirs: more advantageous, because the merchants of the
favoured country, enjoying a sort of monopoly there, will often sell
their goods for a better price than if exposed to the free competition
of all other nations.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_153"><span class="type-margin"><span>but disadvantageous to the favouring country.</span></span>Such
 treaties, however, though they may be advantageous to the merchants and
 manufacturers of the favoured, are necessarily disadvantageous to those
 of the favouring country. A monopoly is thus granted against them to a
foreign nation; and they must frequently buy the foreign goods they have
 occasion for, dearer than if the free competition of other nations was
admitted. That part of its own produce with which such a nation
purchases foreign goods, must consequently be sold cheaper, because when
 two things are exchanged for one another, the cheapness of the one is a
 necessary consequence, or rather is the same thing with the dearness of
 the other. The exchangeable value of its annual produce, therefore, is
likely to be diminished by every such treaty. This diminution, however,
can scarce amount to any positive loss, but only to a lessening of the
gain which it might otherwise make. Though it sells its goods cheaper
than it <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>47<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 otherwise might do, it will not probably sell them for less than they
cost; nor, as in the case of bounties, for a price which will not
replace the capital employed in bringing them to market, together with
the ordinary profits of stock. The trade could not go on long if it did.
 Even the favouring country, therefore, may still gain by the trade,
though less than if there was a free competition.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_154"><span class="type-margin"><span>Treaties have been concluded with the object of obtaining a favourable balance of trade,</span></span>Some
 treaties of commerce, however, have been supposed advantageous upon
principles very different from these; and a commercial country has
sometimes granted a monopoly of this kind against itself to certain
goods of a foreign nation, because it expected that in the whole
commerce between them, it would annually sell more than it would buy,
and that a balance in gold and silver would be annually returned to it.
It is upon this principle that the treaty of commerce between England
and Portugal, concluded in 1703, by Mr. Methuen,<span class="type-margin"><span><span class="ital">e.g.,</span> the Methuen treaty,</span></span> has been so much commended.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt109" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt109_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> The following is a literal translation<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt110" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt110_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> of that treaty, which consists of three articles only.</p>
<div id="lf0206-02_div_008" class="type-section">
<h2 id="lf0206-02_head_006">ART. I</h2>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_155">His sacred royal majesty of Portugal promises,
 both in his own name, and that of his successors, to admit, for ever
hereafter, into Portugal, the woollen cloths, and the rest of the
woollen manufactures of the British, as was accustomed, till they were
prohibited by the law; nevertheless upon this condition:</p>
</div>
<div id="lf0206-02_div_009" class="type-section">
<h2 id="lf0206-02_head_007">ART. II</h2>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_156">That is to say, that her sacred royal majesty
of Great Britain shall, in her own name, and that of her successors, be
obliged, for ever hereafter, to admit the wines of the growth of
Portugal into Britain: so that at no time, whether there shall be peace
or war between the kingdoms of Britain and France, any thing more shall
be demanded for these wines by the name of custom or duty, or by
whatsoever other title, directly or indirectly, whether they shall be
imported into Great Britain in pipes or hogsheads, or other casks, than
what shall be demanded for the like quantity or measure of French wine,
deducting <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>48<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 or abating a third part of the custom or duty. But if at any time this
deduction or abatement of customs, which is to be made as aforesaid,
shall in any manner be attempted and prejudiced, it shall be just and
lawful for his sacred royal majesty of Portugal, again to prohibit the
woollen cloths, and the rest of the British woollen manufactures.</p>
</div>
<div id="lf0206-02_div_010" class="type-section">
<h2 id="lf0206-02_head_008">ART. III</h2>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_157">The most excellent lords the plenipotentiaries
 promise and take upon themselves that their above-named masters shall
ratify this treaty; and within the space of two months the ratifications
 shall be exchanged.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_158"><span class="type-margin"><span>which is evidently advantageous to Portugal and disadvantageous to Great Britain.</span></span>By
 this treaty the crown of Portugal becomes bound to admit the English
woollens upon the same footing as before the prohibition; that is, not
to raise the duties which had been paid before that time. But it does
not become bound to admit them upon any better terms than those of any
other nation, of France or Holland for example. The crown of Great
Britain, on the contrary, becomes bound to admit the wines of Portugal,
upon paying only two-thirds of the duty, which is paid for those of
France, the wines most likely to come into competition with them. So far
 this treaty, therefore, is evidently advantageous to Portugal, and
disadvantageous to Great Britain.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_159"><span class="type-margin"><span>Portugal sends much gold to England</span></span>It
 has been celebrated, however, as a masterpiece of the commercial policy
 of England. Portugal receives annually from the Brazils a greater
quantity of gold than can be employed in its domestic commerce, whether
in the shape of coin or of plate. The surplus is too valuable to be
allowed to lie idle and locked up in coffers, and as it can find no
advantageous market at home, it must, notwithstanding any prohibition,
be sent abroad, and exchanged for something for which there is a more
advantageous market at home. A large share of it comes annually to
England, in return either for English goods, or for those of other
European nations that receive their returns through England. Mr. Baretti
 was informed that the weekly packet-boat from Lisbon brings, one week
with another, more than fifty thousand pounds in gold to England.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt111" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt111_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The sum had probably been exaggerated. It would amount to more than two
 millions six hundred thousand pounds a year, which is more than the
Brazils are supposed to afford.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt112" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt112_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>

 of Portugal. Some privileges which had been granted them, not by
treaty, but by the free grace of that crown, at the solicitation,
indeed, it is probable, and in return for much greater favours, defence
and protection, from the crown of Great Britain, had been either
infringed or revoked. The people, therefore, usually most interested in
celebrating the Portugal trade, were then rather disposed to represent
it as less advantageous than it had commonly been imagined. The far
greater part, almost the whole, they pretended, of this annual
importation of gold, was not on account of Great Britain, but of other
European nations; the fruits and wines of Portugal annually imported
into Great Britain nearly compensating the value of the British goods
sent thither.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_161"><span class="type-margin"><span>but even if it were not so, the trade would not be more valuable than another of equal magnitude.</span></span>Let
 us suppose, however, that the whole was on account of Great Britain,
and that it amounted to a still greater sum than Mr. Baretti seems to
imagine: this trade would not, upon that account, be more advantageous
than any other in which, for the same value sent out, we received an
equal value of consumable goods in return.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_162">It is but a very small part of this importation which, it can be supposed,<span class="type-margin"><span>Most
 of the gold must be sent abroad again and exchanged for goods, and it
would be better to buy the goods direct with home produce instead of
buying gold in Portugal.</span></span> is employed as an annual addition
 either to the plate or to the coin of the kingdom. The rest must all be
 sent abroad and exchanged for consumable goods of some kind or other.
But if those consumable goods were purchased directly with the produce
of English industry, it would be more for the advantage of England, than
 first to purchase with that produce the gold of Portugal, and
afterwards to purchase with that gold those consumable goods. A direct
foreign trade of consumption is always more advantageous than a
round-about one;<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt113" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt113_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> and to bring the same value of foreign goods to the home market, requires a much smaller capital in the one way<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt114" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt114_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 than in the other. If a smaller share of its industry, therefore, had
been employed in producing goods fit for the Portugal market, and a
greater in producing those fit for the other markets, where those
consumable goods for which there is a demand in Great Britain are to be
had, it would have been more for the advantage of England. To procure
both the gold, which it wants for its own use, and the consumable goods,
 would, in this way, employ a much smaller capital than at present.
There would be a spare capital, therefore, to be employed for other
purposes, in exciting an additional quantity of industry, and in raising
 a greater annual produce.</p>

<p id="Smith_0206-02_163"><span class="type-margin"><span>Britain would find little difficulty in procuring gold even if excluded from trade with Portugal.</span></span>Though
 Britain were entirely excluded from the Portugal trade, it could find
very little difficulty in procuring all the annual supplies of gold
which it wants, either for the purposes of plate, or of coin, or of
foreign trade. Gold, like every other commodity, is always somewhere or
another to be got for its value by those who have that value to give for
 it. The annual surplus of gold in Portugal, besides, would still be
sent abroad, and though not carried away by Great Britain, would be
carried away by some other nation, which would be glad to sell it again
for its price, in the same manner as Great Britain does at present. In
buying gold of Portugal, indeed, we buy it at the first hand; whereas,
in buying it of any other nation, except Spain, we should buy it at the
second, and might pay somewhat dearer. This difference, however, would
surely be too insignificant to deserve the public attention.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_164"><span class="type-margin"><span>It is said that all our gold comes from Portugal, but if it did not come from Portugal it would come from other countries.</span></span>Almost
 all our gold, it is said, comes from Portugal. With other nations the
balance of trade is either against us, or not much in our favour. But we
 should remember, that the more gold we import from one country, the
less we must necessarily import from all others. The effectual demand
for gold, like that for every other commodity, is in every country
limited to a certain quantity. If nine-tenths of this quantity are
imported from one country, there remains a tenth only to be imported
from all others. The more gold besides that is annually imported from
some particular countries, over and above what is requisite for plate
and for coin, the more must necessarily be exported to some others; and
the more that most insignificant object of modern policy, the balance of
 trade, appears to be in our favour with some particular countries, the
more it must necessarily appear to be against us with many others.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_165"><span class="type-margin"><span>If the attempt
 of France and Spain to exclude British ships from Portuguese ports had
been successful, it would have been an advantage to England.</span></span>It
 was upon this silly notion, however, that England could not subsist
without the Portugal trade, that, towards the end of the late war,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt115" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt115_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 France and Spain, without pretending either offence or provocation,
required the king of Portugal to exclude all British ships from his
ports, and for the security of this exclusion, to receive into them
French or Spanish garrisons. Had the king of Portugal submitted to those
 ignominious terms which his brother-in-law the king of Spain proposed
to him, Britain would have been freed from a much greater inconveniency
than the loss of the Portugal trade, the burden of supporting a very
weak ally, so unprovided of every thing for his own defence, that the
whole power of England, had it been directed to that single purpose,
could scarce perhaps have defended him for another campaign. The loss of
 the Portugal trade would, no doubt, have <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>51<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 occasioned a considerable embarrassment to the merchants at that time
engaged in it, who might not, perhaps, have found out, for a year or
two, any other equally advantageous method of employing their capitals;
and in this would probably have consisted all the inconveniency which
England could have suffered from this notable piece of commercial
policy.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_166">The great annual importation of gold and silver is neither for the<span class="type-margin"><span>The great importation of gold and silver is for foreign trade</span></span>
 purpose of plate nor of coin, but of foreign trade. A round-about
foreign trade of consumption can be carried on more advantageously by
means of these metals than of almost any other goods. As they are the
universal instruments of commerce, they are more readily received in
return for all commodities than any other goods; and on account of their
 small bulk and great value, it costs less to transport them backward
and forward from one place to another than almost any other sort of
merchandize, and they lose less of their value by being so transported.
Of all the commodities, therefore, which are bought in one foreign
country, for no other purpose but to be sold or exchanged again for some
 other goods in another, there are none so convenient as gold and
silver. In facilitating all the different round-about foreign trades of
consumption which are carried on in Great Britain, consists the
principal advantage of the Portugal trade; and though it is not a
capital advantage, it is, no doubt, a considerable one.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_167">That any annual addition which, it can reasonably be supposed, is<span class="type-margin"><span>Very little is required for plate and coin.</span></span>
 made either to the plate or to the coin of the kingdom, could require
but a very small annual importation of gold and silver, seems evident
enough; and though we had no direct trade with Portugal, this small
quantity could always, somewhere or another, be very easily got.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_168">Though the goldsmiths trade be very considerable in Great Britain,<span class="type-margin"><span>New gold plate is mostly made from old.</span></span>
 the far greater part of the new plate which they annually sell, is made
 from other old plate melted down; so that the addition annually made to
 the whole plate of the kingdom cannot be very great, and could require
but a very small annual importation.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_169">It is the same case with the coin. Nobody imagines, I believe, that<span class="type-margin"><span>New coin is mostly made from old, as there is a profit on melting good coin.</span></span> even the greater part of the annual coinage, amounting, for ten years together, before the late reformation of the gold coin,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt116" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt116_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> to upwards of eight hundred thousand pounds a year in gold,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt117" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt117_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 was an annual addition to the money before current in the kingdom. In a
 country where the expence of the coinage is defrayed by the government,
 the value of the coin, even when it contains its full standard weight
of gold and silver, can never be much greater than that of an equal
quantity of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>52<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 those metals uncoined; because it requires only the trouble of going to
 the mint, and the delay perhaps of a few weeks, to procure for any
quantity of uncoined gold and silver an equal quantity of those metals
in coin. But, in every country, the greater part of the current coin is
almost always more or less worn, or otherwise degenerated from its
standard. In Great Britain it was, before the late reformation, a good
deal so, the gold being more than two per cent. and the silver more than
 eight per cent. below its standard weight. But if forty-four guineas
and a half, containing their full standard weight, a pound weight of
gold, could purchase very little more than a pound weight of uncoined
gold, forty-four guineas and a half wanting a part of their weight could
 not purchase a pound weight, and something was to be added in order to
make up the deficiency. The current price of gold bullion at market,
therefore, instead of being the same with the mint price, or 46 <span class="ital">l.</span> 14 <span class="ital">s.</span> 6 <span class="ital">d.</span> was then about 47 <span class="ital">l.</span> 14 <span class="ital">s.</span>
 and sometimes about forty-eight pounds. When the greater part of the
coin, however, was in this degenerate condition, forty-four guineas and a
 half, fresh from the mint, would purchase no more goods in the market
than any other ordinary guineas, because when they came into the coffers
 of the merchant, being confounded with other money, they could not
afterwards be distinguished without more trouble than the difference was
 worth. Like other guineas they were worth no more than 46 <span class="ital">l.</span> 14 <span class="ital">s.</span> 6 <span class="ital">d.</span>
 If thrown into the melting pot, however, they produced, without any
sensible loss, a pound weight of standard gold, which could be sold at
any time for between 47 <span class="ital">l.</span> 14 <span class="ital">s.</span> and 48 <span class="ital">l.</span>
 either in gold or silver, as fit for all the purposes of coin as that
which had been melted down. There was an evident profit, therefore, in
melting down new coined money, and it was done so instantaneously, that
no precaution of government could prevent it. The operations of the mint
 were, upon this account, somewhat like the web of Penelope; the work
that was done in the day was undone in the night. The mint was employed,
 not so much in making daily additions to the coin, as in replacing the
very best part of it which was daily melted down.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_170"><span class="type-margin"><span>A seignorage raises the value of coin above that of bullion of equal weight,</span></span>Were
 the private people, who carry their gold and silver to the mint, to pay
 themselves for the coinage, it would add to the value of those metals
in the same manner as the fashion does to that of plate. Coined gold and
 silver would be more valuable than uncoined. The seignorage, if it was
not exorbitant, would add to the bullion the whole value of the duty;
because, the government having every where the exclusive privilege of
coining, no coin can come to market cheaper than they think proper to
afford it. If the duty was exorbitant indeed, that is, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>53<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 if it was very much above the real value of the labour and expence
requisite for coinage, false coiners, both at home and abroad, might be
encouraged, by the great difference between the value of bullion and
that of coin, to pour in so great a quantity of counterfeit money as
might reduce the value of the government money. In France, however,
though the seignorage is eight per cent. no sensible inconveniency of
this kind is found to arise from it. The dangers to which a false coiner
 is every where exposed, if he lives in the country of which he
counterfeits the coin, and to which his agents or correspondents are
exposed if he lives in a foreign country, are by far too great to be
incurred for the sake of a profit of six or seven per cent.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_171">The seignorage in France raises the value of the coin higher than<span class="type-margin"><span>as in France</span></span> in proportion to the quantity of pure gold which it contains. Thus by the edict of January 1726, the<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt118" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt118_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 mint price of fine gold of twenty-four carats was fixed at seven
hundred and forty livres nine sous and one denier one-eleventh, the mark
 of eight Paris ounces. The gold coin of France, making an allowance for
 the remedy of the mint, contains twenty-one carats and three-fourths of
 fine gold, and two carats one-fourth of alloy. The mark of standard
gold, therefore, is worth no more than about six hundred and seventy-one
 livres ten deniers. But in France this mark of standard gold is coined
into thirty Louis-d’ors of twenty-four livres each, or into seven
hundred and twenty livres. The coinage, therefore, increases the value
of a mark of standard gold bullion, by the difference between six
hundred and seventy-one livres ten deniers, and seven hundred and twenty
 livres; or by forty-eight livres nineteen sous and two deniers.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_172">A seignorage will, in many cases, take away altogether, and will, in<span class="type-margin"><span>It diminishes or destroys the profit obtained by melting coin.</span></span>
 all cases, diminish the profit of melting down the new coin. This
profit always arises from the difference between the quantity of bullion
 which the common currency ought to contain, and that which it actually
does contain. If this difference is less than the seignorage, there will
 be loss instead of profit. If it is equal to the seignorage, there will
 neither be profit nor loss. If it is greater than the seignorage, there
 <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>54<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 will indeed be some profit, but less than if there was no seignorage.
If, before the late reformation of the gold coin, for example, there had
 been a seignorage of five per cent. upon the coinage, there would have
been a loss of three per cent. upon the melting down of the gold coin.
If the seignorage had been two per cent. there would have been neither
profit nor loss. If the seignorage had been one per cent. there would
have been a profit, but of one per cent. only instead of two per cent.
Wherever money is received by tale, therefore, and not by weight, a
seignorage is the most effectual preventative of the melting down of the
 coin, and, for the same reason, of its exportation. It is the best and
heaviest pieces that are commonly either melted down or exported;
because it is upon such that the largest profits are made.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_173"><span class="type-margin"><span>The abolition of seignorage in England was probably due to the bank of England,</span></span>The law for the encouragement of the coinage, by rendering it duty-free, was first enacted, during the reign of Charles II.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt119" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt119_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> for a limited time; and afterwards continued, by different prolongations, till 1769, when it was rendered perpetual.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt120" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt120_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 The bank of England, in order to replenish their coffers with money,
are frequently obliged to carry bullion to the mint; and it was more for
 their interest, they probably imagined, that the coinage should be at
the expence of the government, than at their own. It was, probably, out
of complaisance to this great company that the government agreed to
render this law perpetual. Should the custom of weighing gold, however,
come to be disused, as it is very likely to be on account of its
inconveniency; should the gold coin of England come to be received by
tale, as it was before the late recoinage, this great company may,
perhaps, find that they have upon this, as upon some other occasions,
mistaken their own interest not a little.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_174"><span class="type-margin"><span>but the bank would have lost nothing by a seignorage whether it equalled the depreciation,</span></span>Before
 the late recoinage, when the gold currency of England was two per cent.
 below its standard weight, as there was no seignorage, it was two per
cent. below the value of that quantity of standard gold bullion which it
 ought to have contained. When this great company, therefore, bought
gold bullion in order to have it coined, they were obliged to pay for it
 two per cent. more than it was worth after the coinage. But if there
had been a seignorage of two per cent. upon the coinage, the common gold
 currency, though two per cent. below <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>55<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 its standard weight, would notwithstanding have been equal in value to
the quantity of standard gold which it ought to have contained; the
value of the fashion compensating in this case the diminution of the
weight. They would indeed have had the seignorage to pay, which being
two per cent. their loss upon the whole transaction would have been two
per cent. exactly the same, but no greater than it actually was.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_175">If the seignorage had been five per cent. and the gold currency only<span class="type-margin"><span>exceeded it,</span></span>
 two per cent. below its standard weight, the bank would in this case
have gained three per cent. upon the price of the bullion; but as they
would have had a seignorage of five per cent. to pay upon the coinage,
their loss upon the whole transaction would, in the same manner, have
been exactly two per cent.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_176">If the seignorage had been only one per cent. and the gold currency<span class="type-margin"><span>or fell short of it</span></span>
 two per cent. below its standard weight, the bank would in this case
have lost only one per cent. upon the price of the bullion; but as they
would likewise have had a seignorage of one per cent. to pay, their loss
 upon the whole transaction would have been exactly two per cent. in the
 same manner as in all other cases.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_177">If there was a reasonable seignorage, while at the same time the<span class="type-margin"><span>Nor would it lose if there were no depreciation</span></span>
 coin contained its full standard weight, as it has done very nearly
since the late re-coinage, whatever the bank might lose by the
seignorage, they would gain upon the price of the bullion; and whatever
they might gain upon the price of the bullion, they would lose by the
seignorage. They would neither lose nor gain, therefore, upon the whole
transaction, and they would in this, as in all the foregoing cases, be
exactly in the same situation as if there was no seignorage.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_178">When the tax upon a commodity is so moderate as not to encourage<span class="type-margin"><span>A seignorage is paid by no one,</span></span>
 smuggling, the merchant who deals in it, though he advances, does not
properly pay the tax, as he gets it back in the price of the commodity.
The tax is finally paid by the last purchaser or consumer. But money is a
 commodity with regard to which every man is a merchant. Nobody buys it
but in order to sell it again; and with regard to it there is in
ordinary cases no last purchaser or consumer. When the tax upon coinage,
 therefore, is so moderate as not to encourage false coining, though
every body advances the tax, nobody finally pays it; because every body
gets it back in the advanced value of the coin.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_179">A moderate seignorage, therefore, would not in any case augment<span class="type-margin"><span>and could not have augmented the expense of the bank.</span></span>
 the expence of the bank, or of any other private persons who carry
their bullion to the mint in order to be coined, and the want of a <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>56<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 moderate seignorage does not in any case diminish it. Whether there is
or is not a seignorage, if the currency contains its full standard
weight, the coinage costs nothing to any body, and if it is short of
that weight, the coinage must always cost the difference between the
quantity of bullion which ought to be contained in it, and that which
actually is contained in it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_180"><span class="type-margin"><span>The government loses and nobody gains by the absence of seignorage</span></span>The
 government, therefore, when it defrays the expence of coinage, not only
 incurs some small expence, but loses some small revenue which it might
get by a proper duty; and neither the bank nor any other private persons
 are in the smallest degree benefited by this useless piece of public
generosity.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_181"><span class="type-margin"><span>Supposing the coin should again become depreciated, a seignorage would preserve the bank from considerable loss.</span></span>The
 directors of the bank, however, would probably be unwilling to agree to
 the imposition of a seignorage upon the authority of a speculation
which promises them no gain, but only pretends to insure them from any
loss. In the present state of the gold coin, and as long as it continues
 to be received by weight, they certainly would gain nothing by such a
change. But if the custom of weighing the gold coin should ever go into
disuse, as it is very likely to do, and if the gold coin should ever
fall into the same state of degradation in which it was before the late
recoinage, the gain, or more properly the savings of the bank, in
consequence of the imposition of a seignorage, would probably be very
considerable. The bank of England is the only company which sends any
considerable quantity of bullion to the mint, and the burden of the
annual coinage falls entirely, or almost entirely, upon it. If this
annual coinage had nothing to do but to repair the unavoidable losses
and necessary wear and tear<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt121" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt121_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 of the coin, it could seldom exceed fifty thousand or at most a hundred
 thousand pounds. But when the coin is degraded below its standard
weight, the annual coinage must, besides this, fill up the large
vacuities which exportation and the melting pot are continually making
in the current coin. It was upon this account that during the ten or
twelve years immediately preceding the late reformation of the gold
coin, the annual coinage amounted at an average to more than eight
hundred and fifty thousand pounds.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt122" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt122_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 But if there had been a seignorage of four or five per cent. upon the
gold coin, it would probably, even in the state in which things then
were, have put an effectual stop to the business both of exportation and
 of the melting pot. The bank, instead of losing every year about two
and a half per cent. upon the bullion which was to be coined into more
than eight hundred and fifty thousand pounds, or incurring an annual
loss of more than twenty-one <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>57<span class="bracket">]</span></span> thousand two hundred and fifty pounds, would not probably have incurred the tenth part of that loss.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_182">The revenue allotted by parliament for defraying the expence of<span class="type-margin"><span>The saving to the government may be regarded as too trifling, but that of the bank is worth consideration.</span></span> the coinage is but fourteen thousand pounds a year,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt123" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt123_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 and the real expence which it costs the government, or the fees of the
officers of the mint, do not upon ordinary occasions, I am assured,
exceed the half of that sum. The saving of so very small a sum, or even
the gaining of another which could not well be much larger, are objects
too inconsiderable, it may be thought, to deserve the serious attention
of government. But the saving of eighteen or twenty thousand pounds a
year in case of an event which is not improbable, which has frequently
happened before, and which is very likely to happen again, is surely an
object which well deserves the serious attention even of so great a
company as the bank of England.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_183">Some of the foregoing reasonings and
observations might perhaps have been more properly placed in those
chapters of the first book which treat of the origin and use of money,
and of the difference between the real and the nominal price of
commodities. But as the law for the encouragement of coinage derives its
 origin from those vulgar prejudices which have been introduced by the
mercantile system; I judged it more proper to reserve them for this
chapter. Nothing could be more agreeable to the spirit of that system
than a sort of bounty upon the production of money, the very thing
which, it supposes, constitutes the wealth of every nation. It is one of
 its many admirable expedients for enriching the country.</p>

<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-02_184">THE interest which
occasioned the first settlement of the different European colonies in
America and the West Indies, was not altogether so plain and distinct as
 that which directed the establishment of those of ancient Greece and
Rome.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_185"><span class="type-margin"><span>Greek colonies were sent out when the population grew too great at home</span></span>All
 the different states of ancient Greece possessed, each of them, but a
very small territory, and when the people in any one of them multiplied
beyond what that territory could easily maintain, a part of them were
sent in quest of a new habitation in some remote and distant part of the
 world; the warlike neighbours who surrounded them on all sides,
rendering it difficult for any of them to enlarge very much its
territory at home. The colonies of the Dorians resorted chiefly to Italy
 and Sicily, which, in the times preceding the foundation of Rome, were
inhabited by barbarous and uncivilized nations: those of the Ionians and
 Eolians, the two other great tribes of the Greeks, to Asia Minor and
the islands of the Egean Sea, of which the inhabitants seem at that time
 to have been pretty much in the same state as those of Sicily and
Italy. The mother city, though she considered the colony as a child, at
all times entitled to great favour and assistance, and owing in return
much gratitude and respect, yet considered<span class="type-margin"><span>The mother city claimed noauthority</span></span>
 it as an emancipated child, over whom she pretended to claim no direct
authority or jurisdiction. The colony settled its own form of
government, enacted its own laws, elected its own magistrates, and made
peace or war with its neighbours as an independent state, which had no
occasion to wait for the approbation or consent of the mother city.
Nothing can be more plain and distinct than the interest which directed
every such establishment.</p>

 founded upon an Agrarian law, which divided the public territory in a
certain proportion among the different citizens who composed the state.
The course of human affairs, by marriage, by succession, and by
alienation, necessarily deranged this original division, and frequently
threw the lands, which had been allotted for the maintenance of many
different families into the possession of a single person. To remedy
this disorder, for such it was supposed to be, a law was made,
restricting the quantity of land which any citizen could possess to five
 hundred jugera, about three hundred and fifty English acres. This law,
however, though we read of its having been executed upon one or two
occasions, was either neglected or evaded, and the inequality of
fortunes went on continually increasing. The greater part of the
citizens had no land, and without it the manners and customs of those
times rendered it difficult for a freeman to maintain his independency.
In the present times, though a poor man has no land of his own, if he
has a little stock, he may either farm the lands of another, or he may
carry on some little retail trade; and if he has no stock, he may find
employment either as a country labourer, or as an artificer. But, among
the ancient Romans, the lands of the rich were all cultivated by slaves,
 who wrought under an overseer, who was likewise a slave; so that a poor
 freeman had little chance of being employed either as a farmer or as a
labourer. All trades and manufactures too, even the retail trade, were
carried on by the slaves of the rich for the benefit of their masters,
whose wealth, authority, and protection made it difficult for a poor
freeman to maintain the competition against them. The citizens,
therefore, who had no land, had scarce any other means of subsistence
but the bounties of the candidates at the annual elections. The
tribunes, when they had a mind to animate the people against the rich
and the great, put them in mind of the ancient division of lands, and
represented that law which restricted this sort of private property as
the fundamental law of the republic. The people became clamorous to get
land, and the rich and the great, we may believe, were perfectly
determined not to give them any part of theirs. To satisfy them in some
measure, therefore, they frequently proposed to send out a new colony.
But conquering Rome was, even upon such occasions, under no necessity of
 turning out her citizens to seek their fortune, if one may say so,
through the wide world, without knowing where they were to settle. She
assigned them lands generally in the conquered provinces of Italy,
where, being within the dominions of the republic, they could never form
 any independent state; but were at best but <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>60<span class="bracket">]</span></span> a sort of corporation, which, though it had the power of enacting byelaws<span class="type-margin"><span>they were entirely subject to the mother city.</span></span>
 for its own government, was at all times subject to the correction,
jurisdiction, and legislative authority of the mother city. The sending
out a colony of this kind, not only gave some satisfaction to the
people, but often established a sort of garrison too in a newly
conquered province, of which the obedience might otherwise have been
doubtful. A Roman colony, therefore, whether we consider the nature of
the establishment itself, or the motives for making it, was altogether
different from a Greek one. The words accordingly, which in the original
 languages denote those different establishments, have very different
meanings. The Latin word (<span class="ital">Colonia</span>) signifies
simply a plantation. The Greek word (αποικα), on the contrary, signifies
 a separation of dwelling, a departure from home, a going out of the
house. But, though the Roman colonies were in many respects different
from the Greek ones, the interest which prompted to establish them was
equally plain and distinct. Both institutions derived their origin
either from irresistible necessity, or from clear and evident utility.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_187"><span class="type-margin"><span>The utility of the American colonies is not so evident.</span></span>The
 establishment of the European colonies in America and the West Indies
arose from no necessity: and though the utility which has resulted from
them has been very great, it is not altogether so clear and evident. It
was not understood at their first establishment, and was not the motive
either of that establishment or of the discoveries which gave occasion
to it; and the nature, extent, and limits of that utility are not,
perhaps, well understood at this day.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_188"><span class="type-margin"><span>The Venetians had a profitable trade in East India goods,</span></span>The
 Venetians, during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, carried on a
very advantageous commerce in spiceries, and other East India goods,
which they distributed among the other nations of Europe. They purchased
 them chiefly<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt124" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt124_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 in Egypt, at that time under the dominion of the Mammeluks, the enemies
 of the Turks, of whom the Venetians were the enemies; and this union of
 interest, assisted by the money of Venice, formed such a connection as
gave the Venetians almost a monopoly of the trade.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_189"><span class="type-margin"><span>which was envied by the Portuguese and led them to discover the Cape of Good Hope passage,</span></span>The
 great profits of the Venetians tempted the avidity of the Portuguese.
They had been endeavouring, during the course of the fifteenth century,
to find out by sea a way to the countries from which the Moors brought
them ivory and gold dust across the Desart. They discovered the
Madeiras, the Canaries, the Azores, the Cape de Verd islands, the coast
of Guinea, that of Loango, Congo, Angola, and Benguela,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt125" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt125_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 and finally, the Cape of Good Hope. They had long wished to share in
the profitable traffic of the Venetians, and this last discovery <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>61<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 opened to them a probable prospect of doing so. In 1497, Vasco de Gama
sailed from the port of Lisbon with a fleet of four ships, and, after a
navigation of eleven months, arrived upon the coast of Indostan, and
thus completed a course of discoveries which had been pursued with great
 steadiness, and with very little interruption, for near a century
together.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_190">Some years before this, while the expectations of Europe were in<span class="type-margin"><span>while Columbus endeavoured to reach the East Indies by sailing westwards.</span></span>
 suspense about the projects of the Portuguese, of which the success
appeared yet to be doubtful, a Genoese pilot formed the yet more daring
project of sailing to the East Indies by the West. The situation of
those countries was at that time very imperfectly known in Europe. The
few European travellers who had been there had magnified the distance;
perhaps through simplicity and ignorance, what was really very great,
appearing almost infinite to those who could not measure it; or,
perhaps, in order to increase somewhat more the marvellous of their own
adventures in visiting regions so immensely remote from Europe. The
longer the way was by the East, Columbus very justly concluded, the
shorter it would be by the West. He proposed, therefore, to take that
way, as both the shortest and the surest, and he had the good fortune to
 convince Isabella of Castile of the probability of his project. He
sailed from the port of Palos in August 1492, near five years before the
 expedition of Vasco de Gama set out from Portugal, and, after a voyage
of between two and three months, discovered first some of the small
Bahama or Lucayan islands, and afterwards the great island of St.
Domingo.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_191">But the countries which Columbus discovered, either in this or in<span class="type-margin"><span>Columbus mistook the countries he found for the Indies.</span></span>
 any of his subsequent voyages, had no resemblance to those which he had
 gone in quest of. Instead of the wealth, cultivation and populousness
of China and Indostan, he found, in St. Domingo, and in all the other
parts of the new world which he ever visited, nothing but a country
quite covered with wood, uncultivated, and inhabited only by some tribes
 of naked and miserable savages. He was not very willing, however, to
believe that they were not the same with some of the countries described
 by Marco Polo, the first European who had visited, or at least had left
 behind him any description of China or the East Indies; and a very
slight resemblance, such as that which he found between the name of
Cibao, a mountain in St. Domingo, and that of Cipango, mentioned by
Marco Polo, was frequently sufficient to make him return to this
favourite prepossession, though contrary to the clearest evidence.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt126" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt126_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> In his letters to Ferdinand and Isabella he called <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>62<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 the countries which he had discovered, the Indies. He entertained no
doubt but that they were the extremity of those which had been described
 by Marco Polo, and that they were not very distant from the Ganges, or
from the countries which had been conquered by Alexander. Even when at
last convinced that they were different, he still flattered himself that
 those rich countries were at no great distance, and in a subsequent
voyage, accordingly, went in quest of them along the coast of Terra
Firma, and towards the isthmus of Darien.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_192"><span class="type-margin"><span>Hence the names East and West Indies.</span></span>In
 consequence of this mistake of Columbus, the name of the Indies has
stuck to those unfortunate countries ever since; and when it was at last
 clearly discovered that the new were altogether different from the old
Indies, the former were called the West, in contradistinction to the
latter, which were called the East Indies.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_193"><span class="type-margin"><span>The countries discovered were not rich</span></span>It
 was of importance to Columbus, however, that the countries which he had
 discovered, whatever they were, should be represented to the court of
Spain as of very great consequence; and, in what constitutes the real
riches of every country, the animal and vegetable productions of the
soil, there was at that time nothing which could well justify such a
representation of them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_194"><span class="type-margin"><span>in animals</span></span>The Cori, something between a rat and a rabbit, and supposed by Mr. Buffon<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt127" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt127_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 to be the same with the Aperea of Brazil, was the largest viviparous
quadruped in St. Domingo. This species seems never to have been very
numerous, and the dogs and cats of the Spaniards are said to have long
ago almost entirely extirpated it, as well as some other tribes of a
still smaller size.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt128" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt128_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> These, however, together with a pretty large lizard, called the Ivana or Iguana,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt129" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt129_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> constituted the principal part of the animal food which the land afforded.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_195"><span class="type-margin"><span>or vegetables,</span></span>The
 vegetable food of the inhabitants, though from their want of industry
not very abundant, was not altogether so scanty. It consisted in Indian
corn, yams, potatoes, bananes, &amp;c. plants which were then altogether
 unknown in Europe, and which have never since been very much esteemed
in it, or supposed to yield a sustenance equal to what is drawn from the
 common sorts of grain and pulse, which have been cultivated in this
part of the world time out of mind.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_196"><span class="type-margin"><span>cotton being not then considered of great consequence.</span></span>The
 cotton plant indeed afforded the material of a very important
manufacture, and was at that time to Europeans undoubtedly the most
valuable of all the vegetable productions of those islands. But though
in the end of the fifteenth century the muslins and other <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>63<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 cotton goods of the East Indies were much esteemed in every part of
Europe, the cotton manufacture itself was not cultivated in any part of
it. Even this production, therefore, could not at that time appear in
the eyes of Europeans to be of very great consequence.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_197">Finding nothing either in the animals or vegetables of the newly<span class="type-margin"><span>So Columbus relied on the minerals.</span></span>
 discovered countries, which could justify a very advantageous
representation of them, Columbus turned his view towards their minerals;
 and in the richness of the productions of this third kingdom, he
flattered himself, he had found a full compensation for the
insignificancy of those of the other two. The little bits of gold with
which the inhabitants ornamented their dress, and which, he was
informed, they frequently found in the rivulets and torrents that fell
from the mountains, were sufficient to satisfy him that those mountains
abounded with the richest gold mines. St. Domingo, therefore, was
represented as a country abounding with gold, and, upon that account
(according to the prejudices not only of the present times, but of those
 times), an inexhaustible source of real wealth to the crown and kingdom
 of Spain. When Columbus, upon his return from his first voyage, was
introduced with a sort of triumphal honours to the sovereigns of Castile
 and Arragon, the principal productions of the countries which he had
discovered were carried in solemn procession before him. The only
valuable part of them consisted in some little fillets, bracelets, and
other ornaments of gold, and in some bales of cotton. The rest were mere
 objects of vulgar wonder and curiosity; some reeds of an extraordinary
size, some birds of a very beautiful plumage, and some stuffed skins of
the huge alligator and manati; all of which were preceded by six or
seven of the wretched natives, whose singular colour and appearance
added greatly to the novelty of the shew.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_198">In consequence of the representations of Columbus, the council of<span class="type-margin"><span>The
 Council of Castile was attracted by the gold, Columbus proposing that
the government should have half the gold and silver discovered.</span></span>
 Castile determined to take possession of countries of which the
inhabitants were plainly incapable of defending themselves. The pious
purpose of converting them to Christianity sanctified the injustice of
the project. But the hope of finding treasures of gold there, was the
sole motive which prompted to undertake it; and to give this motive the
greater weight, it was proposed by Columbus that the half of all the
gold and silver that should be found there should belong to the crown.
This proposal was approved of by the council.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_199">As long as the whole or the far greater part of the gold, which the<span class="type-margin"><span>This was an impossible tax and was soon reduced</span></span>
 first adventurers imported into Europe, was got by so very easy a
method as the plundering of the defenceless natives, it was not perhaps
very difficult to pay even this heavy tax. But when the natives were <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>64<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 once fairly stript of all that they had, which, in St. Domingo, and in
all the other countries discovered by Columbus, was done completely in
six or eight years, and when in order to find more it had become
necessary to dig for it in the mines, there was no longer any
possibility of paying this tax. The rigorous exaction of it,
accordingly, first occasioned, it is said, the total abandoning of the
mines of St. Domingo, which have never been wrought since. It was soon
reduced therefore to a third; then to a fifth; afterwards to a tenth;
and at last to a twentieth part of the gross produce of the gold mines.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt130" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt130_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The tax upon silver continued for a long time to be a fifth of the
gross produce. It was reduced to a tenth only in the course of the
present century.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt131" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt131_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 But the first adventurers do not appear to have been much interested
about silver. Nothing less precious than gold seemed worthy of their
attention.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_200"><span class="type-margin"><span>The subsequent Spanish enterprises were all prompted by the same motive.</span></span>All
 the other enterprises of the Spaniards in the new world, subsequent to
those of Columbus, seem to have been prompted by the same motive. It was
 the sacred thirst of gold that carried Oieda, Nicuessa, and Vasco
Nugnes de Balboa, to the isthmus of Darien, that carried Cortez to
Mexico, and Almagro and Pizzarro to Chili and Peru. When those
adventurers arrived upon any unknown coast, their first enquiry was
always if there was any gold to be found there; and according to the
information which they received concerning this particular, they
determined either to quit the country or to settle in it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_201"><span class="type-margin"><span>A prudent law-giver would not wish to encourage gold and silver mining,</span></span>Of
 all those expensive and uncertain projects, however, which bring
bankruptcy upon the greater part of the people who engage in them, there
 is none perhaps more perfectly ruinous than the search after new silver
 and gold mines. It is perhaps the most disadvantageous lottery in the
world, or the one in which the gain of those who draw the prizes bears
the least proportion to the loss of those who draw the blanks: for
though the prizes are few and the blanks many, the common price of a
ticket is the whole fortune of a very rich man. Projects of mining,
instead of replacing the capital employed in them, together with the
ordinary profits of stock, commonly absorb both capital and profit. They
 are the projects, therefore, to which of all others a prudent
law-giver, who desired to increase the capital of his nation, would
least chuse to give any extraordinary encouragement, or to turn towards
them a greater share of that capital than what would go to them of its
own accord. Such in reality is the absurd confidence which <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>65<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 almost all men have in their own good fortune, that wherever there is
the least probability of success, too great a share of it is apt to go
to them of its own accord.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_202">But though the judgment of sober reason and experience concerning<span class="type-margin"><span>but people have always believed in an Eldorado.</span></span>
 such projects has always been extremely unfavourable, that of human
avidity has commonly been quite otherwise. The same passion which has
suggested to so many people the absurd idea of the philosopher’s stone,
has suggested to others the equally absurd one of immense rich mines of
gold and silver. They did not consider that the value of those metals
has, in all ages and nations, arisen chiefly from their scarcity, and
that their scarcity has arisen from the very small quantities of them
which nature has any where deposited in one place, from the hard and
intractable substances with which she has almost every where surrounded
those small quantities, and consequently from the labour and expence
which are every where necessary in order to penetrate to and get at
them. They flattered themselves that veins of those metals might in many
 places be found as large and as abundant as those which are commonly
found of lead, or copper, or tin, or iron. The dream of Sir Walter
Raleigh concerning the golden city and country of Eldorado,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt132" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt132_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 may satisfy us, that even wise men are not always exempt from such
strange delusions. More than a hundred years after the death of that
great man, the Jesuit Gumila was still convinced of the reality of that
wonderful country, and expressed with great warmth, and I dare to say,
with great sincerity, how happy he should be to carry the light of the
gospel to a people who could so well reward the pious labours of their
missionary.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt133" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt133_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_203">In the countries first discovered by the Spaniards, no gold or silver<span class="type-margin"><span>In this case expectations were to some extent realised, so far as the Spaniards were concerned,</span></span>
 mines are at present known which are supposed to be worth the working.
The quantities of those metals which the first adventurers are said to
have found there, had probably been very much magnified, as well as the
fertility of the mines which were wrought immediately <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>66<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 after the first discovery. What those adventurers were reported to have
 found, however, was sufficient to inflame the avidity of all their
countrymen. Every Spaniard who sailed to America expected to find an
Eldorado. Fortune too did upon this what she has done upon very few
other occasions. She realized in some measure the extravagant hopes of
her votaries, and in the discovery and conquest of Mexico and Peru (of
which the one happened about thirty, the other about forty years after
the first expedition of Columbus), she presented them with something not
 very unlike that profusion of the precious metals which they sought
for.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_204">A project of commerce to the East Indies,
therefore, gave occasion to the first discovery of the West. A project
of conquest gave occasion to all the establishments of the Spaniards in
those newly discovered countries. The motive which excited them to this
conquest was a project of gold and silver mines; and a course of
accidents, which no human wisdom could foresee, rendered this project
much more successful than the undertakers had any reasonable grounds for
 expecting.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_205"><span class="type-margin"><span>but the other nations were not so successful.</span></span>The
 first adventurers of all the other nations of Europe, who attempted to
make settlements in America, were animated by the like chimerical views;
 but they were not equally successful. It was more than a hundred years
after the first settlement of the Brazils, before any silver, gold, or
diamond mines were discovered there. In the English, French, Dutch, and
Danish colonies, none have ever yet been discovered; at least none that
are at present supposed to be worth the working. The first English
settlers in North America, however, offered a fifth of all the gold and
silver which should be found there to the king, as a motive for granting
 them their patents. In the patents to Sir Walter Raleigh, to the London
 and Plymouth companies, to the council of Plymouth, &amp;c. this fifth
was accordingly reserved to the crown. To the expectation of finding
gold and silver mines, those first settlers too joined that of
discovering a north-west passage to the East Indies. They have hitherto
been disappointed in both.</p>

<p id="Smith_0206-02_207">The colonists carry out with them a knowledge of agriculture and<span class="type-margin"><span>Colonists take out knowledge and regular government,</span></span>
 of other useful arts, superior to what can grow up of its own accord in
 the course of many centuries among savage and barbarous nations. They
carry out with them too the habit of subordination, some notion of the
regular government which takes place in their own country, of the system
 of laws which supports<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt134" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt134_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 it, and of a regular administration of justice; and they naturally
establish something of the same kind in the new settlement. But among
savage and barbarous nations, the natural progress of law and government
 is still slower than the natural progress of arts, after law and
government have been so far established, as is necessary for their
protection. Every colonist gets<span class="type-margin"><span>land is plentiful and cheap,</span></span>
 more land than he can possibly cultivate. He has no rent, and scarce
any taxes to pay. No landlord shares with him in its produce, and the
share of the sovereign is commonly but a trifle. He has every motive to
render as great as possible a produce, which is thus to be almost
entirely his own. But his land is commonly so extensive, that with all
his own industry, and with all the industry of other people whom he can
get to employ, he can seldom make it produce the tenth part of what it
is capable of producing. He is eager, therefore, to collect labourers
from all quarters, and to reward them with the most liberal wages. But
those liberal wages, joined to the plenty and cheapness of<span class="type-margin"><span>wages are high</span></span>
 land, soon make those labourers leave him, in order to become landlords
 themselves, and to reward, with equal liberality, other labourers, who
soon leave them for the same reason that they left their first master.
The liberal reward of labour encourages marriage. The children, during
the tender years of infancy, are well fed and properly<span class="type-margin"><span>and children are taken care of and are profitable.</span></span>
 taken care of, and when they are grown up, the value of their labour
greatly overpays their maintenance. When arrived at maturity, the high
price of labour, and the low price of land, enable them to establish
themselves in the same manner as their fathers did before them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_208">In other countries, rent and profit eat up wages, and the two superior<span class="type-margin"><span>Population and improvement, which mean wealth and greatness, are encouraged.</span></span>
 orders of people oppress the inferior one. But in new colonies, the
interest of the two superior orders obliges them to treat the inferior
one with more generosity and humanity; at least, where that inferior one
 is not in a state of slavery. Waste lands of the greatest natural
fertility, are to be had for a trifle. The increase of revenue which the
 proprietor, who is always the undertaker, expects from their
improvement constitutes his profit; which in these circumstances is
commonly very great. But this great profit cannot be made without
employing the labour of other people in clearing and cultivating the
land; and the disproportion between the great extent of the land and the
 small <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>68<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 number of the people, which commonly takes place in new colonies, makes
 it difficult for him to get this labour. He does not, therefore,
dispute about wages, but is willing to employ labour at any price. The
high wages of labour encourage population. The cheapness and plenty of
good land encourage improvement, and enable the proprietor to pay those
high wages. In those wages consists almost the whole price of the land;
and though they are high, considered as the wages of labour, they are
low, considered as the price of what is so very valuable. What
encourages the progress of population and improvement, encourages that
of real wealth and greatness.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_209"><span class="type-margin"><span>The progress of the Greek colonies was very rapid.</span></span>The
 progress of many of the ancient Greek colonies towards wealth and
greatness, seems accordingly to have been very rapid. In the course of a
 century or two, several of them appear to have rivalled, and even to
have surpassed their mother cities. Syracuse and Agrigentum in Sicily,
Tarentum and Locri in Italy, Ephesus and Miletus in Lesser Asia, appear
by all accounts to have been at least equal to any of the cities of
ancient Greece. Though posterior in their establishment, yet all the
arts of refinement, philosophy, poetry, and eloquence, seem to have been
 cultivated as early, and to have been improved as highly in them, as in
 any part of the mother country. The schools of the two oldest Greek
philosophers, those of Thales and Pythagoras, were established, it is
remarkable, not in ancient Greece, but the one in an Asiatic, the other
in an Italian colony.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt135" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt135_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 All those colonies had established themselves in countries inhabited by
 savage and barbarous nations, who easily gave place to the new
settlers. They had plenty of good land, and as they were altogether
independent of the mother city, they were at liberty to manage their own
 affairs in the way that they judged was most suitable to their own
interest.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_210"><span class="type-margin"><span>That of the Roman colonies much less so.</span></span>The
 history of the Roman colonies is by no means so brilliant. Some of
them, indeed, such as Florence, have in the course of many ages, and
after the fall of the mother city, grown up to be considerable states.
But the progress of no one of them seems ever to have been very rapid.
They were all established in conquered provinces, which in most cases
had been fully inhabited before. The quantity of land assigned to each
colonist was seldom very considerable, and as the colony was not
independent, they were not always at liberty to manage their own affairs
 in the way that they judged was most suitable to their own interest.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_211"><span class="type-margin"><span>The American colonies have had plenty of land and not very much interference from their mother countries</span></span>In
 the plenty of good land, the European colonies established in America
and the West Indies resemble, and even greatly surpass, those <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>69<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of ancient Greece. In their dependency upon the mother state, they
resemble those of ancient Rome; but their great distance from Europe has
 in all of them alleviated more or less the effects of this dependency.
Their situation has placed them less in the view and less in the power
of their mother country. In pursuing their interest their own way, their
 conduct has, upon many occasions, been overlooked, either because not
known or not understood in Europe; and upon some occasions it has been
fairly suffered and submitted to, because their distance rendered it
difficult to restrain it. Even the violent and arbitrary government of
Spain has, upon many occasions, been obliged to recall or soften the
orders which had been given for the government of her<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt136" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt136_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 colonies, for fear of a general insurrection. The progress of all the
European colonies in wealth, population, and improvement, has
accordingly been very great.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_212">The crown of Spain, by its share of the gold and silver, derived some<span class="type-margin"><span>The progress of the Spanish colonies, Mexico and Peru, has been very considerable.</span></span>
 revenue from its colonies, from the moment of their first
establishment. It was a revenue too, of a nature to excite in human
avidity the most extravagant expectations of still greater riches. The
Spanish colonies, therefore, from the moment of their first
establishment, attracted very much the attention of their mother
country; while those of the other European nations were for a long time
in a great measure neglected. The former did not, perhaps, thrive the
better in consequence of this attention; nor the latter the worse in
consequence of this neglect. In proportion to the extent of the country
which they in some measure possess, the Spanish colonies are considered
as less populous and thriving than those of almost any other European
nation. The progress even of the Spanish colonies, however, in
population and improvement, has certainly been very rapid and very
great. The city of Lima, founded since the conquest, is represented by
Ulloa, as containing fifty thousand inhabitants near thirty years ago.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt137" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt137_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> Quito, which had been but a miserable hamlet of Indians, is represented by the same author as in his time equally populous.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt138" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt138_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 Gemelli Carreri, a pretended traveller, it is said, indeed, but who
seems every where to have written upon extreme good information,
represents the city of Mexico as containing a hundred thousand
inhabitants;<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt139" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt139_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 a number which, in spite of all the exaggerations of the Spanish
writers, is, probably, more than five times greater than what it
contained in the time of Montezuma. These numbers exceed greatly those
of Boston, New York, and Philadelphia, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>70<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 the three greatest cities of the English colonies. Before the conquest
of the Spaniards there were no cattle fit for draught either in Mexico
or Peru. The lama was their only beast of burden, and its strength seems
 to have been a good deal inferior to that of a common ass. The plough
was unknown among them. They were ignorant of the use of iron. They had
no coined money, nor any established instrument of commerce of any kind.
 Their commerce was carried on by barter. A sort of wooden spade was
their principal instrument of agriculture. Sharp stones served them for
knives and hatchets to cut with; fish bones and the hard sinews of
certain animals served them for needles to sew with; and these seem to
have been their principal instruments of trade.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt140" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt140_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 In this state of things, it seems impossible, that either of those
empires could have been so much improved or so well cultivated as at
present, when they are plentifully furnished with all sorts of European
cattle, and when the use of iron, of the plough, and of many of the arts
 of Europe, has been introduced among them. But the populousness of
every country must be in proportion to the degree of its improvement and
 cultivation. In spite of the cruel destruction of the natives which
followed the conquest, these two great empires are, probably, more
populous now than they ever were before: and the people are surely very
different; for we must acknowledge, I apprehend, that the Spanish
creoles are in many respects superior to the ancient Indians.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_213"><span class="type-margin"><span>The Portuguese colony of Brazil is very populous</span></span>After
 the settlements of the Spaniards, that of the Portugueze in Brazil is
the oldest of any European nation in America. But as for a long time
after the first discovery, neither gold nor silver mines were found in
it, and as it afforded, upon that account, little or no revenue to the
crown, it was for a long time in a great measure neglected; and during
this state of neglect, it grew up to be a great and powerful colony.
While Portugal was under the dominion of Spain, Brazil was attacked by
the Dutch, who got possession of seven of the fourteen provinces into
which it is divided. They expected soon to conquer the other seven, when
 Portugal recovered its independency by the elevation of the family of
Braganza to the throne. The Dutch then, as enemies to the Spaniards,
became friends to the Portugueze, who were likewise the enemies of the
Spaniards. They agreed, therefore, to leave that part of Brazil, which
they had not conquered, to the king of Portugal, who agreed to leave
that part which they had conquered to them, as a matter not worth
disputing about with such good allies. But the Dutch Government soon
began to oppress the Portugueze colonists, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>71<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 who, instead of amusing themselves with complaints, took arms against
their new masters, and by their own valour and resolution, with the
connivance, indeed, but without any avowed assistance from the mother
country, drove them out of Brazil. The Dutch, therefore, finding it
impossible to keep any part of the country to themselves, were contented
 that it should be entirely restored to the crown of Portugal.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt141" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt141_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> In this colony there are said to be more than six hundred thousand people,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt142" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt142_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 either Portugueze or descended from Portugueze, creoles, mulattoes, and
 a mixed race between Portugueze and Brazilians. No one colony in
America is supposed to contain so great a number of people of European
extraction.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_214">Towards the end of the fifteenth, and during the greater part of the<span class="type-margin"><span>When Spain declined, various countries obtained a footing in America</span></span>
 sixteenth century, Spain and Portugal were the two great naval powers
upon the ocean: for though the commerce of Venice extended to every part
 of Europe, its fleets had scarce ever sailed beyond the Mediterranean.
The Spaniards, in virtue of the first discovery, claimed all America as
their own; and though they could not hinder so great a naval power as
that of Portugal from settling in Brazil, such was, at that time, the
terror of their name, that the greater part of the other nations of
Europe were afraid to establish themselves in any other part of that
great continent. The French, who attempted to settle in Florida, were
all murdered by the Spaniards.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt143" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt143_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 But the declension of the naval power of this latter nation, in
consequence of the defeat or miscarriage of, what they called, their
Invincible Armada, which happened towards the end of the sixteenth
century, put it out of their power to obstruct any longer the
settlements of the other European nations. In the course of the
seventeenth century, therefore, the English, French, Dutch, Danes, and
Swedes, all the great nations who had any ports upon the ocean,
attempted to make some settlements in the new world.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_215">The Swedes established themselves in New Jersey; and the number<span class="type-margin"><span>The Swedish colony of New Jersey was prospering when swallowed up by New York.</span></span>
 of Swedish families still to be found there, sufficiently demonstrates,
 that this colony was very likely to prosper, had it been protected by
the mother country. But being neglected by Sweden it was soon swallowed
up by the Dutch colony of New York, which again, in 1674,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt144" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt144_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> fell under the dominion of the English.</p>

 countries in the new world that have ever been possessed by the Danes.
These little settlements too were under the government of an <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>72<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 exclusive company, which had the sole right, both of purchasing the
surplus produce of the colonists, and of supplying them with such goods
of other countries as they wanted, and which, therefore, both in its
purchases and sales, had not only the power of oppressing them, but the
greatest temptation to do so. The government of an exclusive company of
merchants is, perhaps, the worst of all governments for any country
whatever. It was not, however, able to stop altogether the progress of
these colonies, though it rendered it more slow and languid. The late
king of Denmark dissolved this company, and since that time the
prosperity of these colonies has been very great.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_217"><span class="type-margin"><span>The Dutch colony of Surinam is prosperous though still under an exclusive company.</span></span>The
 Dutch settlements in the West, as well as those in the East Indies,
were originally put under the government of an exclusive company. The
progress of some of them, therefore, though it has been considerable, in
 comparison with that of almost any country that has been long peopled
and established, has been languid and slow in comparison with that of
the greater part of new colonies. The colony of Surinam, though very
considerable, is still inferior to the greater part of the sugar
colonies of the other European nations. The colony of Nova Belgia, now
divided into the two provinces of New York and New Jersey, would
probably have soon become considerable too, even though it had remained
under the government of the Dutch. The plenty and cheapness of good land
 are such powerful causes of prosperity, that the very worst government
is scarce capable of checking altogether the efficacy of their
operation. The great distance too from the mother country would enable
the colonists to evade more or less, by smuggling, the monopoly which
the company enjoyed against them. At present the company allows all
Dutch ships to trade to Surinam upon paying two and a half per cent.
upon the value of their cargo for a licence; and only reserves to itself
 exclusively the direct trade from Africa to America, which consists
almost entirely in the slave trade. This relaxation in the exclusive
privileges of the company, is probably the principal cause of that
degree of prosperity which that colony at present enjoys. Curaçoa and
Eustatia, the two principal islands belonging to the Dutch, are free
ports open to the ships of all nations; and this freedom, in the midst
of better colonies whose ports are open to those of one nation only, has
 been the great cause of the prosperity of those two barren islands.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_218"><span class="type-margin"><span>The French colony of Canada has shown rapid progress since the dissolution</span></span>The
 French colony of Canada was, during the greater part of the last

was necessarily very slow in comparison with that of other new <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>73<span class="bracket">]</span></span> colonies; but it became much more rapid when this company was<span class="type-margin"><span>of the exclusive company</span></span>
 dissolved after the fall of what is called the Mississippi scheme. When
 the English got possession of this country, they found in it near
double the number of inhabitants which father Charlevoix had assigned to
 it between twenty and thirty years before.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt145" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt145_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 That jesuit had travelled over the whole country, and had no
inclination to represent it as less considerable than it really was.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_219">The French colony of St. Domingo was established by pirates and<span class="type-margin"><span>St Domingo, in spite of various obstacles, and the other French sugar colonies, are very thriving</span></span> free-booters, who, for a long time, neither required the protection, nor acknowledged the authority of France; and when that<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt146" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt146_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 race of banditti became so far citizens as to acknowledge this
authority, it was for a long time necessary to exercise it with very
great gentleness. During this period the population and improvement of
this colony increased very fast. Even the oppression of the exclusive
company, to which it was for some time subjected, with all the other
colonies of France, though it no doubt retarded, had not been able to
stop its progress altogether. The course of its prosperity returned as
soon as it was relieved from that oppression. It is now the most
important of the sugar colonies of the West Indies, and its produce is
said to be greater than that of all the English sugar colonies put
together. The other sugar colonies of France are in general all very
thriving.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_220">But there are no colonies of which the progress has been more rapid<span class="type-margin"><span>But the progress of the English colonies has been the most rapid</span></span> than that of the English in North America.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_221">Plenty of good land, and liberty to manage

prosperity of all new colonies.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_222">In the plenty of good land the English colonies of North America,<span class="type-margin"><span>They have not so much good land as the Spanish and Portuguese, but their institutions are more favourable to its improvement.</span></span>
 though, no doubt, very abundantly provided, are, however, inferior to
those of the Spaniards and Portugueze, and not superior to some of those
 possessed by the French before the late war. But the political
institutions of the English colonies have been more favourable to the
improvement and cultivation of this land, than those of any of the other
 three nations.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_223">First, the engrossing of uncultivated land, though it has by no<span class="type-margin"><span>(1) The engrossing of uncultivated land has been more restrained</span></span>
 means been prevented altogether, has been more restrained in the
English colonies than in any other. The colony law which imposes upon
every proprietor the obligation of improving and cultivating, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>74<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 within a limited time, a certain proportion of his lands, and which, in
 case of failure, declares those neglected lands grantable to any other
person; though it has not, perhaps, been very strictly executed, has,
however, had some effect.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_224"><span class="type-margin"><span>(2) Primogeniture and entails are less prevalent and alienation more frequent</span></span>Secondly,
 in Pennsylvania there is no right of primogeniture, and lands, like
moveables, are divided equally among all the children of the family. In
three of the provinces of New England the oldest has only a double
share, as in the Mosaical law. Though in those provinces, therefore, too
 great a quantity of land should sometimes be engrossed by a particular
individual, it is likely, in the course of a generation or two, to be
sufficiently divided again. In the other English colonies, indeed, the
right of primogeniture takes place, as in the law of England. But in all
 the English colonies the tenure of the<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt147" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt147_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 lands, which are all held by free socage, facilitates alienation, and
the grantee of any extensive tract of land, generally finds it for his
interest to alienate, as fast as he can, the greater part of it,
reserving only a small quitrent. In the Spanish and Portugueze colonies,
 what is called the right of Majorazzo<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt148" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt148_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 takes place in the succession of all those great estates to which any
title of honour is annexed. Such estates go all to one person, and are
in effect entailed and unalienable. The French colonies, indeed, are
subject to the custom of Paris, which, in the inheritance of land, is
much more favourable to the younger children than the law of England.
But, in the French colonies, if any part of an estate, held by the noble
 tenure of chivalry and homage, is alienated, it is, for a limited time,
 subject to the right of redemption, either by the heir of the superior
or by the heir of the family; and all the largest estates of the country
 are held by such noble tenures, which necessarily embarrass alienation.
 But, in a new colony, a great uncultivated estate is likely to be much
more speedily divided by alienation than by succession. The plenty and
cheapness of good land, it has already been observed,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt149" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt149_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 are the principal causes of the rapid prosperity of new colonies. The
engrossing of land, in effect, destroys this plenty and cheapness.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt150" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt150_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> The engrossing of uncultivated land, besides, is the greatest obstruction to its improvement. But the labour<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt151" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt151_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a>
 that is employed in the improvement and cultivation of land affords the
 greatest and most valuable produce to the society. The produce of
labour, in this case,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt152" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt152_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">6</a> pays not only its own wages, and the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>75<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 profit of the stock which employs it, but the rent of the land too upon
 which it is employed. The labour of the English colonists, therefore,
being more employed in the improvement and cultivation of land, is
likely to afford a greater and more valuable produce, than that of any
of the other three nations, which, by the engrossing of land, is more or
 less diverted towards other employments.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_225">Thirdly, the labour of the English colonists is not only likely to<span class="type-margin"><span>(3) Taxe are more moderate</span></span>
 afford a greater and more valuable produce, but, in consequence of the
moderation of their taxes, a greater proportion of this produce belongs
to themselves, which they may store up and employ in putting into motion
 a still greater quantity of labour. The English colonists have never
yet contributed any thing towards the defence of the mother country, or
towards the support of its civil government. They themselves, on the
contrary, have hitherto been defended almost entirely at the expence of
the mother country. But the expence of fleets and armies is out of all
proportion greater than the necessary expence of civil government. The
expence of their own civil government has always been very moderate. It
has generally been confined to what was necessary for paying competent
salaries to the governor, to the judges, and to some other officers of
police, and for maintaining a few of the most useful public works. The
expence of the civil establishment of Massachusett’s Bay, before the
commencement of the present<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt153" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt153_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> disturbances, used to be but about 18,000 <span class="ital">l.</span> a year. That of New Hampshire and Rhode Island 3,500 <span class="ital">l.</span> each. That of Connecticut 4,000 <span class="ital">l.</span> That of New York and Pennsylvania, 4,500 <span class="ital">l.</span> each. That of New Jersey 1,200 <span class="ital">l.</span> That of Virginia and South Carolina 8,000 <span class="ital">l.</span>
 each. The civil establishments of Nova Scotia and Georgia are partly
supported by an annual grant of parliament. But Nova Scotia pays,
besides, about 7,000 <span class="ital">l.</span> a year towards the public expences of the colony; and Georgia about 2,500 <span class="ital">l.</span>
 a year. All the different civil establishments in North America, in
short, exclusive of those of Maryland and North Carolina, of which no
exact account has been got, did not, before the commencement of the
present disturbances, cost the inhabitants above 64,700 <span class="ital">l.</span> a year;<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt154" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt154_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 an ever-memorable example at how small an expence three millions of
people may not only be governed, but well governed. The most important
part of the expence of government, indeed, that of defence and
protection, has constantly fallen upon the mother country. The
ceremonial too of the civil government in the colonies, upon the
reception of a new governor, upon the opening of a new assembly, &amp;c.
 <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>76<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 though sufficiently decent, is not accompanied with any expensive pomp
or parade. Their ecclesiastical government is conducted upon a plan
equally frugal. Tithes are unknown among them; and their clergy, who are
 far from being numerous, are maintained either by moderate stipends, or
 by the voluntary contributions of the people. The power of Spain and
Portugal, on the contrary, derives some support from the taxes levied
upon their colonies. France, indeed, has never drawn any considerable
revenue from its colonies, the taxes which it levies upon them being
generally spent among them. But the colony government of all these three
 nations is conducted upon a much more expensive plan, and is
accompanied with a much more expensive ceremonial. The sums spent upon
the reception of a new viceroy of Peru, for example, have frequently
been enormous.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt155" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt155_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Such ceremonials are not only real taxes paid by the rich colonists
upon those particular occasions, but they serve to introduce among them
the habit of vanity and expence upon all other occasions. They are not
only very grievous occasional taxes, but they contribute to establish
perpetual taxes of the same kind still more grievous; the ruinous taxes
of private luxury and extravagance. In the colonies of all those three
nations too, the ecclesiastical government is extremely oppressive.
Tithes take place in all of them, and are levied with the utmost rigour
in those of Spain and Portugal. All of them besides are oppressed with a
 numerous race of mendicant friars, whose beggary being not only
licensed, but consecrated by religion, is a most grievous tax upon the
poor people, who are most carefully taught that it is a duty to give,
and a very great sin to refuse them their charity. Over and above all
this, the clergy are, in all of them, the greatest engrossers of land.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_226"><span class="type-margin"><span>(4) The trade monopoly of the mother country has been less oppressive,</span></span>Fourthly,
 in the disposal of their surplus produce, or of what is over and above
their own consumption, the English colonies have been more favoured, and
 have been allowed a more extensive market, than those of any other
European nation. Every European nation has endeavoured more or less to
monopolize to itself the commerce of its colonies, and, upon that
account, has prohibited the ships of foreign nations from trading to
them, and has prohibited them from importing European goods from any
foreign nation. But the manner in which this monopoly has been exercised
 in different nations has been very different.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_227"><span class="type-margin"><span>since there has been no exclusive company with its interest to buy the produce of the colonies as cheap as possible,</span></span>Some
 nations have given up the whole commerce of their colonies to an
exclusive company, of whom the colonies were obliged to buy all <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>77<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 such European goods as they wanted, and to whom they were obliged to
sell the whole of their own surplus produce. It was the interest of the
company, therefore, not only to sell the former as dear, and to buy the
latter as cheap as possible, but to buy no more of the latter, even at
this low price, than what they could dispose of for a very high price in
 Europe. It was their interest, not only to degrade in all cases the
value of the surplus produce of the colony, but in many cases to
discourage and keep down the natural increase of its quantity. Of all
the expedients that can well be contrived to stunt the natural growth of
 a new colony, that of an exclusive company is undoubtedly the most
effectual. This, however, has been the policy of Holland, though their
company, in the course of the present century, has given up in many
respects the exertion of their exclusive privilege. This too was the
policy of Denmark till the reign of the late king. It has occasionally
been the policy of France, and of late, since 1755, after it had been
abandoned by all other nations, on account of its absurdity, it has
become the policy of Portugal with regard at least to two of the
principal provinces of Brazil, Fernambuco and Marannon.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt156" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt156_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_228">Other nations, without establishing an exclusive company, have<span class="type-margin"><span>nor any restriction of commerce to a particular port and to particular licensed ships,</span></span>
 confined the whole commerce of their colonies to a particular port of
the mother country, from whence no ship was allowed to sail, but either
in a fleet and at a particular season, or, if single, in consequence of a
 particular licence, which in most cases was very well paid for. This
policy opened, indeed, the trade of the colonies to all the natives of
the mother country, provided they traded from the proper port, at the
proper season, and in the proper vessels. But as all the different
merchants, who joined their stocks in order to fit out those licensed
vessels, would find it for their interest to act in concert, the trade
which was carried on in this manner would necessarily be conducted very
nearly upon the same principles as that of an exclusive company. The
profit of those merchants would be almost equally exorbitant and
oppressive. The colonies would be ill supplied, and would be obliged
both to buy very dear, and to sell very cheap. This, however, till
within these few years, had<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt157" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt157_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> always been the policy of Spain, and the price of all European goods, accordingly, is said to have been<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt158" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt158_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 enormous in the Spanish West Indies. At Quito, we are told by Ulloa, a
pound of iron sold for about four and six-pence, and a pound of steel
for about six and nine-pence sterling.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt159" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt159_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> But it is chiefly in order to purchase <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>78<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 European goods, that the colonies part with their own produce. The
more, therefore, they pay for the one, the less they really get for the
other, and the dearness of the one is the same thing with the cheapness
of the other. The policy of Portugal is in this respect the same as the
ancient policy of Spain,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt160" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt160_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> with regard to all its colonies, except Fernambuco and Marannon, and with regard to these it has lately adopted a still worse.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_229"><span class="type-margin"><span>but freedom for every subject to trade with every port in the mother country,</span></span>Other
 nations leave the trade of their colonies free to all their subjects,
who may carry it on from all the different ports of the mother country,
and who have occasion for no other licence than the common dispatches of
 the customhouse. In this case the number and dispersed situation of the
 different traders renders it impossible for them to enter into any
general combination, and their competition is sufficient to hinder them
from making very exorbitant profits. Under so liberal a policy the
colonies are enabled both to sell their own produce and to buy the goods
 of Europe at a reasonable price. But since the dissolution of the
Plymouth company, when our colonies were but in their infancy, this has
always been the policy of England. It has generally too been that of
France, and has been uniformly so since the dissolution of what, in
England, is commonly called their Mississippi company. The profits of
the trade, therefore, which France and England carry on with their
colonies, though no doubt somewhat higher than if the competition was
free to all other nations, are, however, by no means exorbitant; and the
 price of European goods accordingly is not extravagantly high in the
greater part of the colonies of either of those nations.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_230"><span class="type-margin"><span>and freedom to export everything but the enumerated commodities to other places besides the mother country.</span></span>In
 the exportation of their own surplus produce too, it is only with
regard to certain commodities that the colonies of Great Britain are
confined to the market of the mother country. These commodities having
been enumerated in the act of navigation and in some other subsequent
acts, have upon that account been called <span class="ital">enumerated commodities.</span><a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt161" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt161_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> The rest are called <span class="ital">non-enumerated;</span>
 and may be exported directly to other countries, provided it is in
British or Plantation ships, of which the owners and three-fourths of
the mariners are British subjects.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_231"><span class="type-margin"><span>Some most important productions are not enumerated</span></span>Among
 the non-enumerated commodities are some of the most important
productions of America and the West Indies; grain of all sorts, lumber,
salt provisions, fish, sugar, and rum.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>79<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_232">Grain is naturally the first and principal object of the culture of all<span class="type-margin"><span>as grain,</span></span>
 new colonies. By allowing them a very extensive market for it, the law
encourages them to extend this culture much beyond the consumption of a
thinly inhabited country, and thus to provide beforehand an ample
subsistence for a continually increasing population.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_233">In a country quite covered with wood, where timber consequently<span class="type-margin"><span>timber,</span></span>
 is of little or no value, the expence of clearing the ground is the
principal obstacle to improvement. By allowing the colonies a very
extensive market for their lumber, the law endeavours to facilitate
improvement by raising the price of a commodity which would otherwise be
 of little value, and thereby enabling them to make some profit of what
would otherwise be a mere expence.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_234">In a country neither half-peopled nor half cultivated, cattle naturally<span class="type-margin"><span>cattle,</span></span>
 multiply beyond the consumption of the inhabitants, and are often upon
that account of little or no value. But it is necessary, it has already
been shewn,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt162" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt162_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 that the price of cattle should bear a certain proportion to that of
corn before the greater part of the lands of any country can be
improved. By allowing to American cattle, in all shapes, dead and alive,
 a very extensive market, the law endeavours to raise the value of a
commodity of which the high price is so very essential to improvement.
The good effects of this liberty, however, must be somewhat diminished
by the 4th of George III. c. 15. which puts hides and skins among the
enumerated commodities, and thereby tends to reduce the value of
American cattle.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_235">To increase the shipping and naval power of Great Britain, by the<span class="type-margin"><span>fish,</span></span>
 extension of the fisheries of our colonies, is an object which the
legislature seems to have had almost constantly in view. Those
fisheries, upon this account, have had all the encouragement which
freedom can give them, and they have flourished accordingly. The New
England fishery in particular was, before the late<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt163" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt163_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 disturbances, one of the most important, perhaps, in the world. The
whale-fishery which, notwithstanding an extravagant bounty, is in Great
Britain carried on to so little purpose, that in the opinion of many
people (which I do not, however, pretend to warrant) the whole produce
does not much exceed the value of the bounties which are annually paid
for it, is in New England carried on without any bounty to a very great
extent. Fish is one of the principal articles with which the North
Americans trade to Spain, Portugal, and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_236">Sugar was originally an enumerated commodity which could be<span class="type-margin"><span>sugar,</span></span>
 exported only to Great Britain. But in 1731, upon a representation of
the sugar-planters, its exportation was permitted to all parts of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>80<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the world.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt164" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt164_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> The restrictions,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt165" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt165_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 however, with which this liberty was granted, joined to the high price
of sugar in Great Britain, have rendered it, in a great measure,
ineffectual. Great Britain and her colonies still continue to be almost
the sole market for all the sugar produced in the British plantations.
Their consumption increases so fast, that, though in consequence of the
increasing improvement of Jamaica, as well as of the Ceded Islands,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt166" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt166_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 the importation of sugar has increased very greatly within these twenty
 years, the exportation to foreign countries is said to be not much
greater than before.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_237"><span class="type-margin"><span>and rum.</span></span>Rum
 is a very important article in the trade which the Americans carry on
to the coast of Africa, from which they bring back negroe slaves in
return.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_238"><span class="type-margin"><span>Grain, meat and fish would have competed too strongly with British produce if forced into the British market.</span></span>If
 the whole surplus produce of America in grain of all sorts, in salt
provisions, and in fish, had been put into the enumeration, and thereby
forced into the market of Great Britain, it would have interfered too
much with the produce of the industry of our own people. It was probably
 not so much from any regard to the interest of America, as from a
jealousy of this interference, that those important commodities have not
 only been kept out of the enumeration, but that the importation into
Great Britain of all grain, except rice, and of salt provisions, has, in
 the ordinary state of the law, been prohibited.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_239"><span class="type-margin"><span>Originally
non-enumerated commodities could be exported to any part of the world.
Recently they have been confined to countries south of Cape Finisterre.</span></span>The
 non-enumerated commodities could originally be exported to all parts of
 the world. Lumber and rice, having been once put into the enumeration,
when they were afterwards taken out of it, were confined, as to the
European market, to the countries that lie south of Cape Finisterre.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt167" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt167_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 By the 6th of George III. c. 52. all non-enumerated commodities were
subjected to the like restriction. The parts of Europe which lie south
of Cape Finisterre, are not manufacturing countries, and we were less
jealous of the colony ships carrying home from them any manufactures
which could interfere with our own.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_240"><span class="type-margin"><span>The enumerated
 commodities are (1) commodities not produced at all in the mother
country, and (2) commodities of which only a small part of the supply is
 produced in the mother country,</span></span>The enumerated commodities
 are of two sorts: first, such as are either the peculiar produce of
America, or as cannot be produced, or at least are not produced, in the
mother country. Of this kind are, melasses, coffee, cacao-nuts, tobacco,
 pimento, ginger, whale-fins, raw <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>81<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 silk, cotton-wool, beaver, and other peltry of America, indigo, fustic,
 and other dying woods: secondly, such as are not the peculiar produce
of America, but which are and may be produced in the mother country,
though not in such quantities as to supply the greater part of her
demand, which is principally supplied from foreign countries. Of this
kind are all naval stores, masts, yards, and bowsprits, tar, pitch, and
turpentine, pig and bar iron, copper ore, hides and skins, pot and pearl
 ashes. The largest importation of commodities of the first kind could
not discourage the growth or interfere with the sale of any part of the
produce of the mother country. By confining them to the home market, our
 merchants, it was expected, would not only be enabled to buy them
cheaper in the Plantations, and consequently to sell them with a better
profit at home, but to establish between the Plantations and foreign
countries an advantageous carrying trade, of which Great Britain was
necessarily to be the center or emporium, as the European country into
which those commodities were first to be imported. The importation of
commodities of the second kind might be so managed too, it was supposed,
 as to interfere, not with the sale of those of the same kind which were
 produced at home, but with that of those which were imported from
foreign countries; because, by means of proper duties, they might be
rendered always somewhat dearer than the former, and yet a good deal
cheaper than the latter. By confining such commodities to the home
market, therefore, it was proposed to discourage the produce, not of
Great Britain, but of some foreign countries with which the balance of
trade was believed to be unfavourable to Great Britain.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_241">The prohibition of exporting from the colonies, to any other country<span class="type-margin"><span>On the importation of naval stores to Great Britain a bounty was given.</span></span>
 but Great Britain, masts, yards, and bowsprits, tar, pitch, and
turpentine, naturally tended to lower the price of timber in the
colonies, and consequently to increase the expence of clearing their
lands, the principal obstacle to their improvement. But about the
beginning of the present century, in 1703, the pitch and tar company of
Sweden endeavoured to raise the price of their commodities to Great
Britain, by prohibiting their exportation, except in their own ships, at
 their own price, and in such quantities as they thought proper.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt168" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt168_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 In order to counteract this notable piece of mercantile policy, and to
render herself as much as possible independent, not only of Sweden, but
of all the other northern powers, Great Britain gave a bounty upon the
importation of naval stores from America<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt169" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt169_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> and the effect of this bounty was to raise the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>82<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 price of timber in America, much more than the confinement to the home
market could lower it; and as both regulations were enacted at the same
time, their joint effect was rather to encourage than to discourage the
clearing of land in America.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_242"><span class="type-margin"><span>American pig iron is exempt from duty.</span></span>Though
 pig and bar iron too have been put among the enumerated commodities,
yet as, when imported from America, they are exempted from considerable
duties to which they are subject when imported from any other country,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt170" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt170_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 the one part of the regulation contributes more to encourage the
erection of furnaces in America, than the other to discourage it. There
is no manufacture which occasions so great a consumption of wood as a
furnace, or which can contribute so much to the clearing of a country
over-grown with it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_243"><span class="type-margin"><span>These regulations have raised the value of timber and thus helped to clear the country.</span></span>The
 tendency of some of these regulations to raise the value of timber in
America, and thereby to facilitate the clearing of the land, was
neither, perhaps, intended nor understood by the legislature. Though
their beneficial effects, however, have been in this respect accidental,
 they have not upon that account been less real.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_244"><span class="type-margin"><span>Freedom of trade prevails between the British American colonies and the British West Indies.</span></span>The
 most perfect freedom of trade is permitted between the British colonies
 of America and the West Indies, both in the enumerated and in the
non-enumerated commodities. Those colonies are now become so populous
and thriving, that each of them finds in some of the others a great and
extensive market for every part of its produce. All of them taken
together, they make a great internal market for the produce of one
another.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_245"><span class="type-margin"><span>British liberality does not extend to refined manufactures.</span></span>The
 liberality of England, however, towards the trade of her colonies has
been confined chiefly to what concerns the market for their produce,
either in its rude state, or in what may be called the very first stage
of manufacture. The more advanced or more refined manufactures even of
the colony produce, the merchants and manufacturers of Great Britain
chuse to reserve to themselves, and have prevailed upon the legislature
to prevent their establishment in the colonies, sometimes by high
duties, and sometimes by absolute prohibitions.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_246"><span class="type-margin"><span>Manufactured sugar is subject to heavy duty.</span></span>While, for example, Muskovado sugars from the British plantations, pay upon importation only 6 <span class="ital">s.</span> 4 <span class="ital">d.</span> the hundred weight; white sugars pay 1 <span class="ital">l.</span> 1 <span class="ital">s.</span> 1 <span class="ital">d.;</span> and refined, either double or single, in loaves 4 <span class="ital">l.</span> 2 <span class="ital">s.</span> 5 <span class="ital">d.</span>
 8/20. When those high duties were imposed, Great Britain was the sole,
and she still continues to be the principal market to which the sugars
of the British colonies could be exported. They amounted, therefore, to a
 prohibition, at first of claying or refining sugar for any <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>83<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 foreign market, and at present of claying or refining it for the
market, which takes off, perhaps, more than nine-tenths of the whole
produce. The manufacture of claying or refining sugar accordingly,
though it has flourished in all the sugar colonies of France, has been
little cultivated in any of those of England, except for the market of
the colonies themselves. While Grenada was in the hands of the French,
there was a refinery of sugar, by claying at least, upon almost every
plantation. Since it fell into those of the English, almost all works of
 this kind have been given up, and there are at present, October 1773, I
 am assured, not above two or three remaining in the island. At present,
 however, by an indulgence of the custom-house, clayed or refined sugar,
 if reduced from loaves into powder, is commonly imported as Muskovado.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_247">While Great Britain encourages in America the manufactures of<span class="type-margin"><span>Steel furnaces and slit-mills may not be erected in the colonies.</span></span>
 pig and bar iron, by exempting them from duties to which the like
commodities are subject when imported from any other country, she
imposes an absolute prohibition upon the erection of steel furnaces and
slit-mills in any of her American plantations.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt171" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt171_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 She will not suffer her colonists to work in those more refined
manufactures even for their own consumption; but insists upon their
purchasing of her merchants and manufacturers all goods of this kind
which they have occasion for.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_248">She prohibits the exportation from one province to another by<span class="type-margin"><span>Hats, wools and woollen goods produced in America may not be carried in bulk from province to province.</span></span> water, and even the carriage by land upon horseback or in a cart, of hats, of wools and woollen goods,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt172" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt172_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 of the produce of America; a regulation which effectually prevents the
establishment of any manufacture of such commodities for distant sale,
and confines the industry of her colonists in this way to such coarse
and household manufactures, as a private family commonly makes for its
own use, or for that of some of its neighbours in the same province.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_249">To prohibit a great people, however, from making all that they can<span class="type-margin"><span>Such prohibitions, though a violation of sacred rights, have not as yet been very hurtful.</span></span>
 of every part of their own produce, or from employing their stock and
industry in the way that they judge most advantageous to themselves, is a
 manifest violation of the most sacred rights of mankind. Unjust,
however, as such prohibitions may be, they have not hitherto been very
hurtful to the colonies. Land is still so cheap, and, consequently,
labour so dear among them, that they can import from the mother country,
 almost all the more refined or more advanced manufactures <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>84<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 cheaper than they could make them for themselves. Though they had not,
therefore, been prohibited from establishing such manufactures, yet in
their present state of improvement, a regard to their own interest
would, probably, have prevented them from doing so. In their present
state of improvement, those prohibitions, perhaps, without cramping
their industry, or restraining it from any employment to which it would
have gone of its own accord, are only impertinent badges of slavery
imposed upon them, without any sufficient reason, by the groundless
jealousy of the merchants and manufacturers of the mother country. In a
more advanced state they might be really oppressive and insupportable.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_250"><span class="type-margin"><span>The importation into Great Britain of various colonial productions is encouraged either by abatement of duties or by bounties</span></span>Great
 Britain too, as she confines to her own market some of the most
important productions of the colonies, so in compensation she gives to
some of them an advantage in that market; sometimes by imposing higher
duties upon the like productions when imported from other countries, and
 sometimes by giving bounties upon their importation from the colonies.
In the first way she gives an advantage in the home-market to the sugar,
 tobacco, and iron of her own colonies, and in the second to their raw
silk, to their hemp and flax, to their indigo, to their naval-stores,
and to their building-timber.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt173" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt173_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 This second way of encouraging the colony produce by bounties upon
importation, is, so far as I have been able to learn, peculiar to Great
Britain. The first is not. Portugal does not content herself with
imposing higher duties upon the importation of tobacco from any other
country, but prohibits it under the severest penalties.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_251"><span class="type-margin"><span>In regard to imports from Europe the British colonies have had more liberal treatment than those of other countries,</span></span>With
 regard to the importation of goods from Europe, England has likewise
dealt more liberally with her colonies than any other nation.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_252">Great Britain allows a part, almost always the
 half, generally a larger portion, and sometimes the whole of the duty
which is paid upon the importation of foreign goods, to be drawn back
upon their exportation to any foreign country.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt174" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt174_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 No independent foreign country, it was easy to foresee, would receive
them if they came to it loaded with the heavy duties to which almost all
 foreign goods are subjected on their importation into Great Britain.
Unless, therefore, some part of those duties was drawn back upon
exportation, there was an end of the carrying trade; a trade so much
favoured by the mercantile system.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_253"><span class="type-margin"><span>drawbacks being allowed,</span></span>Our colonies, however, are by no means independent foreign countries; and Great Britain having assumed to herself the exclusive <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>85<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 right of supplying them with all goods from Europe, might have forced
them (in the same manner as other countries have done their colonies) to
 receive such goods, loaded with all the same duties which they paid in
the mother country. But, on the contrary, till 1763, the same drawbacks
were paid upon the exportation of the greater part of foreign goods to
our colonies as to any independent foreign country. In 1763, indeed, by
the 4th of Geo. III. c. 15. this indulgence was a good deal abated, and
it was enacted, “That no part of the duty called the old subsidy should
be drawn back for any goods of the growth, production, or manufacture of
 Europe or the East Indies, which should be exported from this kingdom
to any British colony or plantation in America; wines, white callicoes
and muslins expected.”<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt175" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt175_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Before this law, many different sorts of foreign goods might have been
bought cheaper in the plantations than in the mother country; and some
may still.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_254">Of the greater part of the regulations concerning the colony trade,<span class="type-margin"><span>owing to the advice of interested merchants</span></span>
 the merchants who carry it on, it must be observed, have been the
principal advisers. We must not wonder, therefore, if, in the greater
part of them, their interest has been more considered than either that
of the colonies or that of the mother country. In their exclusive
privilege of supplying the colonies with all the goods which they wanted
 from Europe, and of purchasing all such parts of their surplus produce
as could not interfere with any of the trades which they themselves
carried on at home, the interest of the colonies was sacrificed to the
interest of those merchants. In allowing the same drawbacks upon the
re-exportation of the greater part of European and East India goods to
the colonies, as upon their re-exportation to any independent country,
the interest of the mother country was sacrificed to it, even according
to the mercantile ideas of that interest. It was for the interest of the
 merchants to pay as little as possible for the foreign goods which they
 sent to the colonies, and consequently, to get back as much as possible
 of the duties which they advanced upon their importation into Great
Britain. They might thereby be enabled to sell in the colonies, either
the same quantity of goods with a greater profit, or a greater quantity
with the same profit, and, consequently, to gain something either in the
 one way or the other. It was, likewise, for the interest of the
colonies to get all such goods as cheap and in as great abundance as
possible. But this might not always be for the interest of the mother
country. She might frequently suffer both in <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>86<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 her revenue, by giving back a great part of the duties which had been
paid upon the importation of such goods; and in her manufactures, by
being undersold in the colony market, in consequence of the easy terms
upon which foreign manufactures could be carried thither by means of
those drawbacks. The progress of the linen manufacture of Great Britain,
 it is commonly said, has been a good deal retarded by the drawbacks
upon the re-exportation of German linen to the American colonies.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_255">But though the policy of Great Britain with
regard to the trade of her colonies has been dictated by the same
mercantile spirit as that of other nations, it has, however, upon the
whole, been less illiberal and oppressive than that of any of them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_256"><span class="type-margin"><span>Except in regard to foreign trade the English colonies have complete liberty</span></span>In
 every thing, except their foreign trade, the liberty of the English
colonists to manage their own affairs their own way is complete. It is
in every respect equal to that of their fellow-citizens at home, and is
secured in the same manner, by an assembly of the representatives of the
 people, who claim the sole right of imposing taxes for the support of
the colony government. The authority of this assembly over-awes the
executive power, and neither the meanest nor the most obnoxious
colonist, as long as he obeys the law, has any thing to fear from the
resentment, either of the governor, or of any other civil or military
officer in the province. The colony assemblies, though like the house of
 commons in England, they are not always a very equal representation of
the people, yet they approach more nearly to that character; and<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt176" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt176_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 as the executive power either has not the means to corrupt them, or, on
 account of the support which it receives from the mother country, is
not under the necessity of doing so, they are perhaps in general more
influenced by the inclinations of their constituents. The councils,
which, in the colony legislatures, correspond to the house of lords in
Great Britain, are not composed of an hereditary nobility. In some of
the colonies, as in three of the governments of New England, those
councils are not appointed by the king, but chosen by the
representatives of the people. In none of the English colonies is there
any hereditary nobility. In all of them, indeed, as in all other free
countries, the descendant of an old colony family is more respected than
 an upstart of equal merit and fortune: but he is only more respected,
and he has no privileges by which he can be troublesome to his
neighbours. Before the commencement of the present disturbances, the
colony assemblies had not only the legislative, but a part of the
executive power. In Connecticut and Rhode Island, they elected <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>87<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the governor.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt177" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt177_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 In the other colonies they appointed the revenue officers who collected
 the taxes imposed by those respective assemblies, to whom those
officers were immediately responsible. There is more equality,
therefore, among the English colonists than among the inhabitants of the
 mother country. Their manners are more republican, and their
governments, those of three of the provinces of New England in
particular, have hitherto been more republican too.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_257">The absolute governments of Spain, Portugal, and France, on the<span class="type-margin"><span>The
 absolute governments of Spain, of Portugal, and in a less degree of
France, are even more violent in the colonies than at home.</span></span>
 contrary, take place in their colonies; and the discretionary powers
which such governments commonly delegate to all their inferior officers
are, on account of the great distance, naturally exercised there with
more than ordinary violence. Under all absolute governments there is
more liberty in the capital than in any other part of the country. The
sovereign himself can never have either interest or inclination to
pervert the order of justice, or to oppress the great body of the
people. In the capital his presence over-awes more or less all his
inferior officers, who in the remoter provinces, from whence the
complaints of the people are less likely to reach him, can exercise
their tyranny with much more safety. But the European colonies in
America are more remote than the most distant provinces of the greatest
empires which had ever been known before. The government of the English
colonies is perhaps the only one which, since the world began, could
give perfect security to the inhabitants of so very distant a province.
The administration of the French colonies, however, has always been
conducted with more gentleness and moderation than that of the Spanish
and Portuguese. This superiority of conduct is suitable both to the
character of the French nation, and to what forms the character of every
 nation, the nature of their government, which, though arbitrary and
violent in comparison with that of Great Britain, is legal and free in
comparison with those of Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_258">It is in the progress of the North American colonies, however, that<span class="type-margin"><span>The
 sugar colonies of France are more prosperous than the English because
they are not discouraged from refining, and slaves are better managed,</span></span>
 the superiority of the English policy chiefly appears. The progress of
the sugar colonies of France has been at least equal, perhaps superior,
to that of the greater part of those of England; and yet the sugar
colonies of England enjoy a free government nearly of the same kind with
 that which takes place in her colonies of North America. But the sugar
colonies of France are not discouraged, like those of England, from
refining their own sugar; and, what is of still greater <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>88<span class="bracket">]</span></span> importance, the genius of their government naturally introduces a better management of their negro slaves.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_259"><span class="type-margin"><span>absolute government being more favourable to the slaves than republican,</span></span>In
 all European colonies the culture of the sugar-cane is carried on by
negro slaves. The constitution of those who have been born in the
temperate climate of Europe could not, it is supposed, support the
labour of digging the ground under the burning sun of the West Indies;
and the culture of the sugar-cane, as it is managed at present, is all
hand labour, though, in the opinion of many, the drill plough might be
introduced into it with great advantage. But, as the profit and success
of the cultivation which is carried on by means of cattle, depend very
much upon the good management of those cattle; so the profit and success
 of that which is carried on by slaves, must depend equally upon the
good management of those slaves; and in the good management of their
slaves the French planters, I think it is generally allowed, are
superior to the English. The law, so far as it gives some weak
protection to the slave against the violence of his master, is likely to
 be better executed in a colony where the government is in a great
measure arbitrary, than in one where it is altogether free. In every
country where the unfortunate law of slavery is established, the
magistrate, when he protects the slave, intermeddles in some measure in
the management of the private property of the master; and, in a free
country, where the master is perhaps either a member of the colony
assembly, or an elector of such a member, he dare not do this but with
the greatest caution and circumspection. The respect which he is obliged
 to pay to the master, renders it more difficult for him to protect the
slave. But in a country where the government is in a great measure
arbitrary, where it is usual for the magistrate to intermeddle even in
the management of the private property of individuals, and to send them,
 perhaps, a lettre de cachet if they do not manage it according to his
liking, it is much easier for him to give some protection to the slave;
and common humanity naturally disposes him to do so. The protection of
the magistrate renders the slave less contemptible in the eyes of his
master, who is thereby induced to consider him with more regard, and to
treat him with more gentleness. Gentle usage renders the slave not only
more faithful, but more intelligent, and therefore, upon a double
account, more useful. He approaches more to the condition of a free
servant, and may possess some degree of integrity and attachment to his
master’s interest, virtues which frequently belong to free servants, but
 which never can belong to a slave, who is treated as slaves commonly
are in countries where the master is perfectly free and secure.</p>

<p id="Smith_0206-02_260">That the condition of a slave is better under an arbitrary than under<span class="type-margin"><span>as may be seen in Roman history</span></span>
 a free government, is, I believe, supported by the history of all ages
and nations. In the Roman history, the first time we read of the
magistrate interposing to protect the slave from the violence of his
master, is under the emperors. When Vedius Pollio, in the presence of
Augustus, ordered one of his slaves, who had committed a slight fault,
to be cut into pieces and thrown into his fish-pond in order to feed his
 fishes, the emperor commanded him, with indignation, to emancipate
immediately, not only that slave, but all the others that belonged to
him.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt178" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt178_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> Under the republic no magistrate could have had authority enough to protect the slave, much less to punish the master.</p>

 colonies of France, particularly the great colony of St. Domingo, has
been raised almost entirely from the gradual improvement and cultivation
 of those colonies. It has been almost altogether the produce of the
soil and of the industry<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt179" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt179_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 of the colonists, or, what comes to the same thing, the price of that
produce gradually accumulated by good management, and employed in
raising a still greater produce. But the stock which has improved and
cultivated the sugar colonies of England has, a great part of it, been
sent out from England, and has by no means been altogether the produce
of the soil and industry of the colonists.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt180" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt180_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 The prosperity of the English sugar colonies has been, in a great
measure, owing to the great riches of England, of which a part has
overflowed, if one may say so, upon those colonies. But the prosperity
of the sugar colonies of France has been entirely owing to the good
conduct of the colonists, which must therefore have had some superiority
 over that of the English; and this superiority has been remarked in
nothing so much as in the good management of their slaves.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_262">Such have been the general outlines of the policy of the different<span class="type-margin"><span>The policy of Europe has done nothing for the prosperity of the colonies</span></span> European nations with regard to their colonies.</p>

governments of New England. The English catholics, treated with much

Portuguese Jews, persecuted by the inquisition, stript of their
fortunes, and banished to Brazil, introduced, by their example, some
sort of order and industry among the transported felons and strumpets,
by whom that colony was originally peopled, and taught them the culture
of the sugar-cane.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt184" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt184_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 Upon all these different occasions it was, not the wisdom and policy,
but the disorder and injustice of the European governments, which
peopled and cultivated America.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_267"><span class="type-margin"><span>To the actual establishment of the colonies the governments of Europe contributed little,</span></span>In
 effectuating some of the most important of these establishments, the
different governments of Europe had as little merit as in projecting
them. The conquest of Mexico was the project, not of the council of
Spain, but of a governor of Cuba;<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt185" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt185_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> and it was effectuated by the spirit of the bold adventurer<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt186" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt186_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a>
 to whom it was entrusted, in spite of every thing which that governor,
who soon repented of having trusted such a person, could do to thwart
it. The conquerors of Chili and Peru, and of almost all the other
Spanish settlements upon the continent of America, carried out with them
 no other public encouragement, but a general permission to make
settlements and conquests in the name of the king of Spain. Those
adventures were all at the private risk and expence of the adventurers.
The government of Spain contributed scarce any thing to any of them.
That of England contributed as little towards effectuating the
establishment of some of its most important colonies in North America.</p>

 considerable as to attract the attention of the mother country, the
first regulations which she made with regard to them had always in view
to secure to herself the monopoly of their commerce; to confine their
market, and to enlarge her own at their expence, and, consequently,
rather to damp and discourage, than to quicken and forward the course of
 their prosperity. In the different ways in which this monopoly has been
 exercised, consists one of the most essential differences in the policy
 of the different European nations with regard to their colonies. The
best of them all, that of England, is only somewhat less illiberal and
oppressive than that of any of the rest.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_269">In what way, therefore, has the policy of Europe contributed either<span class="type-margin"><span>Europe has done nothing except provide the men who founded the colonies.</span></span>

actions, and of laying the foundation of so great an empire; and there
is no other quarter of the world of which the policy is capable of

inhabitants of this great continent with a variety of commodities which
they could not otherwise have possessed, some for conveniency and use,
some for pleasure, and some for ornament, and thereby contributes to
increase their enjoyments.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_275"><span class="type-margin"><span><span id="lf0206-02_label_233">(<span class="ital">b</span>)</span> an augmentation of industry not only in the countries which trade with America directly,</span></span>The
 discovery and colonization of America, it will readily be allowed, have
 contributed to augment the industry, first, of all the countries which
trade to it directly; such as Spain, Portugal, France, and England; and,
 secondly, of all those which, without trading to it directly, send,
through the medium of other countries, goods to it of their own produce;
 such as Austrian Flanders, and some provinces of Germany, which,
through the medium of the countries before mentioned, send to it a
considerable quantity of linen and other goods. All such countries have
evidently gained a more extensive market for their surplus produce, and
must consequently have been encouraged to increase its quantity.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_276"><span class="type-margin"><span>but also in other countries which do not send their produce to America,</span></span>But,
 that those great events should likewise have contributed to encourage
the industry of countries, such as Hungary and Poland, which may never,
perhaps, have sent a single commodity of their own produce to America,
is not, perhaps, altogether so evident. That those events have done so,
however, cannot be doubted. Some part of the produce of America is
consumed in Hungary and Poland, and there is some demand there for the
sugar, chocolate, and tobacco, of that new quarter of the world. But
those commodities must be purchased with something which is either the
produce of the industry of Hungary and Poland, or with something which
had been purchased with some part of that produce. Those commodities of
America are new values, new equivalents, introduced into Hungary and
Poland to be exchanged there for the surplus produce of those countries.
 By being carried thither they create a new and more extensive market
for that surplus produce. They raise its value, and thereby contribute
to encourage its increase. Though no part of it may ever be carried to
America, it may be carried to other countries which purchase it with a
part of their share of the surplus produce of America; and it may find a
 market by <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>93<span class="bracket">]</span></span> means of the circulation of that trade which was originally put into motion by the surplus produce of America.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_277">Those great events may even have contributed to increase the enjoyments,<span class="type-margin"><span>or even receive any produce from America</span></span>
 and to augment the industry of countries which, not only never sent any
 commodities to America, but never received any from it. Even such
countries may have received a greater abundance of other commodities
from countries of which the surplus produce had been augmented by means
of the American trade. This greater abundance, as it must necessarily
have increased their enjoyments, so it must likewise have augmented
their industry. A greater number of new equivalents of some kind or
other must have been presented to them to be exchanged for the surplus
produce of that industry. A more extensive market must have been created
 for that surplus produce, so as to raise its value, and thereby
encourage its increase. The mass of commodities annually thrown into the
 great circle of European commerce, and by its various revolutions
annually distributed among all the different nations comprehended within
 it, must have been augmented by the whole surplus produce of America. A
 greater share of this greater mass, therefore, is likely to have fallen
 to each of those nations, to have increased their enjoyments, and
augmented their industry.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_278">The exclusive trade of the mother countries tends to diminish, or,<span class="type-margin"><span>The exclusive trade of the mother countries reduces the enjoyments and industry of all Europe and America, especially the latter</span></span>
 at least, to keep down below what they would otherwise rise to, both
the enjoyments and industry of all those nations in general, and of the
American colonies in particular. It is a dead weight upon the action of
one of the great springs which puts into motion a great part of the
business of mankind. By rendering the colony produce dearer in all other
 countries, it lessens its consumption, and thereby cramps the industry
of the colonies, and both the enjoyments and the industry of all other
countries, which both enjoy less when they pay more for what they enjoy,
 and produce less when they get less for what they produce. By rendering
 the produce of all other countries dearer in the colonies, it cramps,
in the same manner, the industry of all other countries, and both the
enjoyments and the industry of the colonies. It is a clog which, for the
 supposed benefit of some particular countries, embarrasses the
pleasures, and encumbers the industry of all other countries; but of the
 colonies more than of any other. It not<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt189" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt189_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 only excludes, as much as possible, all other countries from one
particular market; but it confines, as much as possible, the colonies to
 one particular market: and the difference is very great between being <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>94<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 excluded from one particular market, when all others are open, and
being confined to one particular market, when all others are shut up.
The surplus produce of the colonies, however, is the original source of
all that increase of enjoyments and industry which Europe derives from
the discovery and colonization of America; and the exclusive trade of
the mother countries tends to render this source much less abundant than
 it otherwise would be.</p>

 particular advantages which each colonizing country derives from the

first, those common advantages which every empire derives from the

peculiar a nature as the European colonies of America.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_280">The common advantages which every empire
derives from the provinces subject to its dominion, consist, first, in
the military force which they furnish for its defence; and, secondly, in
 the revenue which they furnish for the support of its civil government.
 The Roman colonies furnished occasionally both the one and the other.
The Greek colonies, sometimes, furnished a military force; but seldom
any revenue.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt190" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt190_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a><span class="type-margin"><span>(<span class="ital">a</span>) the common advantages are contributions of military forces and revenue,</span></span>

subjects in peace.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_281"><span class="type-margin"><span>but none of the colonies have ever furnished military force.</span></span>The
 European colonies of America have never yet furnished any military
force for the defence of the mother country. Their military force has
never yet been sufficient for their own defence; and in the different
wars in which the mother countries have been engaged, the defence of
their colonies has generally occasioned a very considerable distraction
of the military force of those countries. In this respect, therefore,
all the European colonies have, without exception, been a cause rather
of weakness than of strength to their respective mother countries.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_282"><span class="type-margin"><span>and the colonies of Spain and Portugal alone have contributed revenue.</span></span>The
 colonies of Spain and Protugal only have contributed any revenue
towards the defence of the mother country, or the support of her civil
government.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt191" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt191_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 The taxes which have been levied upon those of other European nations,
upon those of England in particular, have seldom been equal to the
expence laid out upon them in time of peace, and never sufficient to
defray that which they occasioned in time of war. Such colonies,
therefore, have been a source of expence and not of revenue to their
respective mother countries.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>95<span class="bracket">]</span></span>

 can be sent to no other country but England. Other countries must
afterwards buy it of her. It must be cheaper therefore in England than
it can be in any other country, and must contribute more to increase the
 enjoyments of England than those of any other country. It must likewise
 contribute more to encourage her industry. For all those parts of her
own surplus produce which England exchanges for those enumerated
commodities, she must get a better price than any other countries can
get for the like parts of theirs, when they exchange them for the same
commodities. The manufactures of England, for example, will purchase a
greater quantity of the sugar and tobacco of her own colonies, than the
like manufactures of other countries can purchase of that sugar and
tobacco. So far, therefore, as the manufactures of England and those of
other countries are both to be exchanged for the sugar and tobacco of
the English colonies, this superiority of price gives an encouragement
to the former, beyond what the latter can in these circumstances enjoy.
The exclusive trade of the colonies, therefore, as it diminishes, or, at
 least, keeps down below what they would otherwise rise to, both the
enjoyments and the industry of the countries which do not possess it; so
 it gives an evident advantage to the countries which do possess it over
 those other countries.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_285">This advantage, however, will, perhaps, be found to be rather what<span class="type-margin"><span>rather than an advantage to that country,</span></span>
 may be called a relative than an absolute advantage; and to give a
superiority to the country which enjoys it, rather by depressing the
industry and produce of other countries, than by raising those of that
particular country above what they would naturally rise to in the case
of a free trade.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_286">The tobacco of Maryland and Virginia, for example, by means of<span class="type-margin"><span><span class="ital">e.g.,</span> England gets tobacco cheaper than France, but not cheaper than it would if there were no exclusive trade.</span></span>
 the monopoly which England enjoys of it, certainly comes cheaper to
England than it can do to France, to whom England commonly sells a
considerable part of it. But had France, and all other European
countries been, at all times, allowed a free trade to Maryland and
Virginia, the tobacco of those colonies might, by this time, have come <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>96<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 cheaper than it actually does, not only to all those other countries,
but likewise to England. The produce of tobacco, in consequence of a
market so much more extensive than any which it has hitherto enjoyed,
might, and probably would, by this time, have been so much increased as
to reduce the profits of a tobacco plantation to their natural level
with those of a corn plantation, which, it is supposed, they are still
somewhat above.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt193" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt193_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The price of tobacco might, and probably would, by this time, have
fallen somewhat lower than it is at present. An equal quantity of the
commodities either of England, or of those other countries, might have
purchased in Maryland and Virginia a greater quantity of tobacco than it
 can do at present, and, consequently, have been sold there for so much a
 better price. So far as that weed, therefore, can, by its cheapness and
 abundance, increase the enjoyments or augment the industry either of
England or of any other country, it would, probably, in the case of a
free trade, have produced both these effects in somewhat a greater
degree than it can do at present. England, indeed, would not in this
case have had any advantage over other countries. She might have bought
the tobacco of her colonies somewhat cheaper, and, consequently, have
sold some of her own commodities somewhat dearer than she actually does.
 But she could neither have bought the one cheaper nor sold the other
dearer than any other country might have done. She might, perhaps, have
gained an absolute, but she would certainly have lost a relative
advantage.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_287"><span class="type-margin"><span>To subject other countries to this disadvantage England has made two sacrifices</span></span>In
 order, however, to obtain this relative advantage in the colony trade,
in order to execute the invidious and malignant project of excluding as
much as possible other nations from any share in it, England, there are
very probable reasons for believing, has not only sacrificed a part of
the absolute advantage which she, as well as every other nation, might
have derived from that trade, but has subjected herself both to an
absolute and to a relative disadvantage in almost every other branch of
trade.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_288"><span class="type-margin"><span>The withdrawal
 of foreign capital from the colony trade raised profits in it and drew
capital from other British trades and thereby raised profits in them,</span></span>When, by the act of navigation,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt194" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt194_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 England assumed to herself the monopoly of the colony trade, the
foreign capitals which had before been employed in it were necessarily
withdrawn from it. The English capital, which had before carried on but a
 part of it, was now to carry on the whole. The capital which had before
 supplied the colonies with but a part of the goods which they wanted
from Europe, was now all that was employed to supply them with the
whole. But it could not supply them with the whole, and the goods with
which it did supply them were necessarily sold very dear. The capital
which had <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>97<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 before bought but a part of the surplus produce of the colonies, was
now all that was employed to buy the whole. But it could not buy the
whole at any thing near the old price, and, therefore, whatever it did
buy it necessarily bought very cheap. But in an employment of capital in
 which the merchant sold very dear and bought very cheap, the profit
must have been very great, and much above the ordinary level of profit
in other branches of trade. This superiority of profit in the colony
trade could not fail to draw from other branches of trade a part of the
capital which had before been employed in them. But this revulsion of
capital, as it must have gradually increased the competition of capitals
 in the colony trade, so it must have gradually diminished that
competition in all those other branches of trade; as it must have
gradually lowered the profits of the one, so it must have gradually
raised those of the other, till the profits of all came to a new level,
different from and somewhat higher than that at which they had been
before.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_289">This double effect, of drawing capital from all other trades, and of<span class="type-margin"><span>and continues to do so</span></span>
 raising the rate of profit somewhat higher than it otherwise would have
 been in all trades, was not only produced by this monopoly upon its
first establishment, but has continued to be produced by it ever since.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_290">First, this monopoly has been continually drawing capital from all<span class="type-margin"><span>The colony trade has increased faster than the whole British capital,</span></span> other trades to be employed in that of the colonies.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_291">Though the wealth of Great Britain has
increased very much since the establishment of the act of navigation, it
 certainly has not increased in the same proportion as that of the
colonies. But the foreign trade of every country naturally increases in
proportion to its wealth, its surplus produce in proportion to its whole
 produce; and Great Britain having engrossed to herself almost the whole
 of what may be called the foreign trade of the colonies, and her
capital not having increased in the same proportion as the extent of
that trade, she could not carry it on without continually withdrawing
from other branches of trade some part of the capital which had before
been employed in them, as well as withholding from them a great deal
more which would otherwise have gone to them. Since the establishment of
 the act of navigation, accordingly, the colony trade has been
continually increasing, while many other branches of foreign trade,
particularly of that to other parts of Europe, have been continually
decaying. Our manufactures for foreign sale, instead of being suited, as
 before the act of navigation, to the neighbouring market of Europe, or
to the more distant one of the countries which lie round the
Mediterranean sea, have, the greater part of them, been accommodated to
the still more distant one of the colonies, to the market in which they
have the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>98<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 monopoly, rather than to that in which they have many competitors. The
causes of decay in other branches of foreign trade, which, by Sir
Matthew Decker,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt195" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt195_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 and other writers, have been sought for in the excess and improper mode
 of taxation, in the high price of labour, in the increase of luxury,
&amp;c. may all be found in the over-growth of the colony trade. The
mercantile capital of Great Britain, though very great, yet not being
infinite; and though greatly increased since the act of navigation, yet
not being increased in the same proportion as the colony trade, that
trade could not possibly be carried on without withdrawing some part of
that capital from other branches of trade, nor consequently without some
 decay of those other branches.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_292"><span class="type-margin"><span>and the colonial monopoly has merely changed the direction of British trade.</span></span>England,
 it must be observed, was a great trading country, her mercantile
capital was very great and likely to become still greater and greater
every day, not only before the act of navigation had established the
monopoly of the colony trade, but before that trade was very
considerable. In the Dutch war, during the government of Cromwel, her
navy was superior to that of Holland; and in that which broke out in the
 beginning of the reign of Charles II. it was at least equal, perhaps
superior, to the united navies of France and Holland. Its superiority,
perhaps, would scarce appear greater in the present times; at least if
the Dutch navy was to bear the same proportion to the Dutch commerce now
 which it did then. But this great naval power could not, in either of
those wars, be owing to the act of navigation. During the first of them
the plan of that act had been but just formed; and though before the
breaking out of the second it had been fully enacted by legal authority;
 yet no part of it could have had time to produce any considerable
effect, and least of all that part which established the exclusive trade
 to the colonies. Both the colonies and their trade were inconsiderable
then in comparison of what they are now. The island of Jamaica was an
unwholesome desert, little inhabited, and less cultivated. New York and
New Jersey were in the possession of the Dutch: the half of St.
Christopher’s in that of the French. The island of Antigua, the two
Carolinas, Pensylvania, Georgia, and Nova Scotia, were not planted.
Virginia, Maryland, and New England were planted; and though they were
very thriving colonies, yet there was not, perhaps, at that time, either
 in Europe or America, a single person who foresaw or even suspected the
 rapid progress which they have since made in wealth, population and
improvement. The island of Barbadoes, in short, was the only British
colony of any consequence of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>99<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 which the condition at that time bore any resemblance to what it is at
present. The trade of the colonies, of which England, even for some time
 after the act of navigation, enjoyed but a part (for the act of
navigation was not very strictly executed till several years after it
was enacted), could not at that time be the cause of the great trade of
England, nor of the great naval power which was supported by that trade.
 The trade which at that time supported that great naval power was the
trade of Europe, and of the countries which lie round the Mediterranean
sea. But the share which Great Britain at present enjoys of that trade
could not support any such great naval power. Had the growing trade of
the colonies been left free to all nations, whatever share of it might
have fallen to Great Britain, and a very considerable share would
probably have fallen to her, must have been all an addition to this
great trade of which she was before in possession. In consequence of the
 monopoly, the increase of the colony trade has not so much occasioned
an addition to the trade which Great Britain had before, as a total
change in its direction.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_293">Secondly, this monopoly has necessarily contributed to keep up the<span class="type-margin"><span>The monopoly has kept the rate of profit in British trade higher than it naturally would have been,</span></span>
 rate of profit in all the different branches of British trade higher
than it naturally would have been, had all nations been allowed a free
trade to the British colonies.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_294">The monopoly of the colony trade, as it
necessarily drew towards that trade a greater proportion of the capital
of Great Britain than what would have gone to it of its own accord; so
by the expulsion of all foreign capitals it necessarily reduced the
whole quantity of capital employed in that trade below what it naturally
 would have been in the case of a free trade. But, by lessening the
competition of capitals in that branch of trade, it necessarily raised
the rate of profit<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt196" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt196_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 in that branch. By lessening too the competition of British capitals in
 all other branches of trade, it necessarily raised the rate of British
profit in all those other branches. Whatever may have been, at any
particular period, since the establishment of the act of navigation, the
 state or extent of the mercantile capital of Great Britain, the
monopoly of the colony trade must, during the continuance of that state,
 have raised the ordinary rate of British profit higher than it
otherwise would have been both in that and in all the other branches of
British trade. If, since the establishment of the act of navigation, the
 ordinary rate of British profit has fallen considerably, as it
certainly has, it must have fallen still lower, had not the monopoly
established by that act contributed to keep it up.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>100<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_295"><span class="type-margin"><span>and this puts the country at a disadvantage in the trades of which she has no monopoly,</span></span>But
 whatever raises in any country the ordinary rate of profit higher than
it otherwise would be, necessarily subjects that country both to an
absolute and to a relative disadvantage in every branch of trade of
which she has not the monopoly.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_296">It subjects her to an absolute disadvantage: because in such branches<span class="type-margin"><span>making her buy less and sell less</span></span>
 of trade her merchants cannot get this greater profit, without selling
dearer than they otherwise would do both the goods of foreign countries
which they import into their own, and the goods of their own country
which they export to foreign countries. Their own country must both buy
dearer and sell dearer; must both buy less and sell less; must both
enjoy less and produce less, than she otherwise would do.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_297"><span class="type-margin"><span>and enabling other countries to undersell her in foreign markets</span></span>It
 subjects her to a relative disadvantage; because in such branches of
trade it sets other countries which are not subject to the same absolute
 disadvantage, either more above her or less below her than they
otherwise would be. It enables them both to enjoy more and to produce
more in proportion to what she enjoys and produces. It renders their
superiority greater or their inferiority less than it otherwise would
be. By raising the price of her produce above what it otherwise would
be, it enables the merchants of other countries to undersell her in
foreign markets, and thereby to justle her out of almost all those
branches of trade, of which she has not the monopoly.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_298"><span class="type-margin"><span>High profits raise the price of manufactures more than high wages</span></span>Our
 merchants frequently complain of the high wages of British labour as
the cause of their manufactures being undersold in foreign markets; but
they are silent about the high profits of stock. They complain of the
extravagant gain of other people; but they say nothing of their own. The
 high profits of British stock, however, may contribute towards raising
the price of British manufactures in many cases as much, and in some
perhaps more, than the high wages of British labour.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt197" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt197_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_299"><span class="type-margin"><span>So British capital has been taken from European and Mediterranean trade,</span></span>It
 is in this manner that the capital of Great Britain, one may justly
say, has partly been drawn and partly been driven from the greater part
of the different branches of trade of which she has not the monopoly;
from the trade of Europe in particular, and from that of the countries
which lie round the Mediterranean sea.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_300"><span class="type-margin"><span>partly attracted by high profit in the colony trade,</span></span>It
 has partly been drawn from those branches of trade; by the attraction
of superior profit in the colony trade in consequence of the continual
increase of that trade, and of the continual insufficiency of the
capital which had carried it on one year to carry it on the next.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_301"><span class="type-margin"><span>partly driven out by foreign competition</span></span>It
 has partly been driven from them; by the advantage which the high rate
of profit, established in Great Britain, gives to other countries, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>101<span class="bracket">]</span></span> in all the different branches of trade of which Great Britain has not the monopoly.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_302">As the monopoly of the colony trade has drawn from those other<span class="type-margin"><span>While raising British profit, the monopoly has lowered foreign profits</span></span>
 branches a part of the British capital which would otherwise have been
employed in them, so it has forced into them many foreign capitals which
 would never have gone to them, had they not been expelled from the
colony trade. In those other branches of trade it has diminished the
competition of British capitals, and thereby raised the rate of British
profit higher than it otherwise would have been. On the contrary, it has
 increased the competition of foreign capitals, and thereby sunk the
rate of foreign profit lower than it otherwise would have been. Both in
the one way and in the other it must evidently have subjected Great
Britain to a relative disadvantage in all those other branches of trade.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_303">The colony trade, however, it may perhaps be said, is more advantageous<span class="type-margin"><span>The colony trade is supposed to be more advantageous than others,</span></span>
 to Great Britain than any other; and the monopoly, by forcing into that
 trade a greater proportion of the capital of Great Britain than what
would otherwise have gone to it, has turned that capital into an
employment more advantageous to the country than any other which it
could have found.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_304">The most advantageous employment of any capital to the country<span class="type-margin"><span>but
 trade with a neighbouring country is more advantageous than with a
distant one, and a direct trade is more advantageous than a roundabout,</span></span>
 to which it belongs, is that which maintains there the greatest
quantity of productive labour, and increases the most the annual produce
 of the land and labour of that country. But the quantity of productive
labour which any capital employed in the foreign trade of consumption
can maintain, is exactly in proportion, it has been shewn in the second
book,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt198" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt198_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 to the frequency of its returns. A capital of a thousand pounds, for
example, employed in a foreign trade of consumption, of which the
returns are made regularly once in the year, can keep in constant
employment, in the country to which it belongs, a quantity of productive
 labour equal to what a thousand pounds can maintain there for a year.
If the returns are made twice or thrice in the year, it can keep in
constant employment a quantity of productive labour equal to what two or
 three thousand pounds can maintain there for a year. A foreign trade of
 consumption carried on with a neighbouring,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt199" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt199_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 is, upon this account, in general, more advantageous than one carried
on with a distant country; and for the same reason a direct foreign
trade of consumption, as it has likewise been shewn in the second book,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt200" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt200_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> is in general more advantageous than a round-about one.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>102<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_305"><span class="type-margin"><span>while the monopoly has forced capital into (1) a distant and (2) a roundabout trade.</span></span>But
 the monopoly of the colony trade, so far as it has operated upon the
employment of the capital of Great Britain, has in all cases forced some
 part of it from a foreign trade of consumption carried on with a
neighbouring,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt201" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt201_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 to one carried on with a more distant country, and in many cases from a
 direct foreign trade of consumption to a round-about one.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_306"><span class="type-margin"><span>(1) The trade with America and the West Indies is distant and the returns peculiarly infrequent</span></span>First,
 the monopoly of the colony trade has in all cases forced some part of
the capital of Great Britain from a foreign trade of consumption carried
 on with a neighbouring, to one carried on with a more distant country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_307">It has, in all cases, forced some part of that
 capital from the trade with Europe, and with the countries which lie
round the Mediterranean sea, to that with the more distant regions of
America and the West Indies, from which the returns are necessarily less
 frequent, not only on account of the greater distance, but on account
of the peculiar circumstances of those countries. New colonies, it has
already been observed, are always understocked. Their capital is always
much less than what they could employ with great profit and advantage in
 the improvement and cultivation of their land. They have a constant
demand, therefore, for more capital than they have of their own; and, in
 order to supply the deficiency of their own, they endeavour to borrow
as much as they can of the mother country, to whom they are, therefore,
always in debt. The most common way in which the colonists contract this
 debt, is not by borrowing upon bond of the rich people of the mother
country, though they sometimes do this too, but by running as much in
arrear to their correspondents, who supply them with goods from Europe,
as those correspondents will allow them. Their annual returns frequently
 do not amount to more than a third, and sometimes not to so great a
proportion of what they owe. The whole capital, therefore, which their
correspondents advance to them is seldom returned to Britain in less
than three, and sometimes not in less than four or five years. But a
British capital of a thousand pounds, for example, which is returned to
Great Britain only once in five years, can keep in constant employment
only one-fifth part of the British industry which it could maintain if
the whole was returned once in the year; and, instead of the quantity of
 industry which a thousand pounds could maintain for a year, can keep in
 constant employment the quantity only which two hundred pounds can
maintain for a year. The planter, no doubt, by the high price which he
pays for the goods from Europe, by the interest upon the bills which he
grants at distant dates, and by the commission upon the renewal of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>103<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 those which he grants at near dates, makes up, and probably more than
makes up, all the loss which his correspondent can sustain by this
delay. But, though he may make up the loss of his correspondent, he
cannot make up that of Great Britain. In a trade of which the returns
are very distant, the profit of the merchant may be as great or greater
than in one in which they are very frequent and near; but the advantage
of the country in which he resides, the quantity of productive labour
constantly maintained there, the annual produce of the land and labour
must always be much less. That the returns of the trade to America, and
still more those of that to the West Indies, are, in general, not only
more distant, but more irregular, and more uncertain too, than those of
the trade to any part of Europe, or even of the countries which lie
round the Mediterranean sea, will readily be allowed, I imagine, by
every body who has any experience of those different branches of trade.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_308">Secondly, the monopoly of the colony trade has, in many case,<span class="type-margin"><span><span id="lf0206-02_label_249">(2)</span> It is also largely a roundabout trade.</span></span> forced some part of the capital of Great Britain from a direct foreign trade of consumption, into a round-about one.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_309">Among the enumerated commodities which can be
sent to no other market but Great Britain, there are several of which
the quantity exceeds very much the consumption of Great Britain, and of
which a part, therefore, must be exported to other countries. But this
cannot be done without forcing some part of the capital of Great Britain
 into a round-about foreign trade of consumption. Maryland and Virginia,
 for example, send annually to Great Britain upwards of ninety-six
thousand hogsheads of tobacco, and the consumption of Great Britain is
said not to exceed fourteen thousand.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt202" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt202_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Upwards of eighty-two thousand hogsheads, therefore, must be exported
to other countries, to France, to Holland, and to the countries which
lie round the Baltic and Mediterranean seas. But, that part of the
capital of Great Britain which brings those eighty-two thousand
hogsheads to Great Britain, which re-exports them from thence to those
other countries, and which brings back from those other countries to
Great Britain either goods or money in return, is employed in a
round-about foreign trade of consumption; and is necessarily forced into
 this employment in order to dispose of this great surplus. If we would
compute in how many years the whole of this capital is likely to come
back to Great Britain, we must add to the distance of the American
returns that of the returns from those other countries. If, in the
direct foreign trade of consumption which we carry on with America, the
whole capital <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>104<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 employed frequently does not come back in less than three or four
years; the whole capital employed in this round-about one is not likely
to come back in less than four or five. If the one can keep in constant
employment but a third or a fourth part of the domestic industry which
could be maintained by a capital returned once in the year, the other
can keep in constant employment but a fourth or a fifth part of that
industry. At some of the outports a credit is commonly given to those
foreign correspondents to whom they export their tobacco. At the port of
 London, indeed, it is commonly sold for ready money. The rule is, <span class="ital">Weigh and pay.</span>
 At the port of London, therefore, the final returns of the whole
round-about trade are more distant than the returns from America by the
time only which the goods may lie unsold in the warehouse; where,
however, they may sometimes lie long enough.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt203" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt203_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 But, had not the colonies been confined to the market of Great Britain
for the sale of their tobacco, very little more of it would probably
have come to us than what was necessary for the home consumption. The
goods which Great Britain purchases at present for her own consumption
with the great surplus of tobacco which she exports to other countries,
she would, in this case, probably have purchased with the immediate
produce of her own industry, or with some part of her own manufactures.
That produce, those manufactures, instead of being almost entirely
suited to one great market, as at present, would probably have been
fitted to a great number of smaller markets. Instead of one great
round-about foreign trade of consumption, Great Britain would probably
have carried on a great number of small direct foreign trades of the
same kind. On account of the frequency of the returns, a part, and
probably but a small part; perhaps not above a third or a fourth, of the
 capital which at present carries on this great round-about trade, might
 have been sufficient to carry on all those small direct ones, might
have kept in constant employment an equal quantity of British industry,
and have equally supported the annual produce of the land and labour of
Great Britain. All the purposes of this trade being, in this manner,
answered by a much smaller capital, there would have been a large spare
capital to apply to other purposes; to improve the lands, to increase
the manufactures, and to extend the commerce of Great Britain; to come
into competition at least with the other British capitals employed in
all those different ways, to reduce the rate of profit in them all, and
thereby to give to Great Britain, in all of them, a superiority over
other countries still greater than what she at present enjoys.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt204" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt204_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>105<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_310">The monopoly of the colony trade too has forced some part of the<span class="type-margin"><span>The monopoly has also forced part of the capital of Great Britain into a carrying trade.</span></span>
 capital of Great Britain from all foreign trade of consumption to a
carrying trade; and, consequently, from supporting more or less the
industry of Great Britain, to be employed altogether in supporting
partly that of the colonies, and partly that of some other countries.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_311">The goods, for example, which are annually
purchased with the great surplus of eighty-two thousand hogsheads of
tobacco annually re-exported from Great Britain, are not all consumed in
 Great Britain. Part of them, linen from Germany and Holland, for
example, is returned to the colonies for their particular consumption.
But, that part of the capital of Great Britain which buys the tobacco
with which this linen is afterwards bought, is necessarily withdrawn
from supporting the industry of Great Britain, to be employed altogether
 in supporting, partly that of the colonies, and partly that of the
particular countries who pay for this tobacco with the produce of their
own industry.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_312">The monopoly of the colony trade besides, by forcing towards it a<span class="type-margin"><span>and makes her whole industry and commerce less secure owing to its being driven into one channel</span></span>
 much greater proportion of the capital of Great Britain than what would
 naturally have gone to it, seems to have broken altogether that natural
 balance which would otherwise have taken place among all the different
branches of British industry. The industry of Great Britain, instead of
being accommodated to a great number of small markets, has been
principally suited to one great market. Her commerce, instead of running
 in a great number of small channels, has been taught to run principally
 in one great channel. But the whole system of her industry and commerce
 has thereby been rendered less secure; the whole state of her body
politic less healthful, than it otherwise would have been. In her
present condition, Great Britain resembles one of those unwholesome
bodies in which some of the vital parts are overgrown, and which, upon
that account, are liable to many dangerous disorders scarce incident to
those in which all the parts are more properly proportioned. A small
stop in that great blood-vessel, which has been artificially swelled
beyond its natural dimensions, and through which an unnatural proportion
 of the industry and commerce of the country has been forced to
circulate, is very likely to bring on the most dangerous disorders upon
the whole body politic. The expectation of a rupture with the colonies,
accordingly, has struck the people of Great Britain with more terror
than they ever felt for a Spanish armada, or a French invasion. It was
this terror, whether well or ill grounded, which rendered the repeal of
the stamp act,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt205" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt205_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> among the merchants at least, a popular measure. In the total exclusion from <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>106<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 the colony market, was it to last only for a few years, the greater
part of our merchants used to fancy that they foresaw an entire stop to
their trade; the greater part of our master manufacturers, the entire
ruin of their business; and the greater part of our workmen, an end of
their employment. A rupture with any of our neighbours upon the
continent, though likely too to occasion some stop or interruption in
the employments of some of all these different orders of people, is
foreseen, however, without any such general emotion. The blood, of which
 the circulation is stopt in some of the smaller vessels, easily
disgorges itself into the greater, without occasioning any dangerous
disorder; but, when it is stopt in any of the greater vessels,
convulsions, apoplexy, or death, are the immediate and unavoidable
consequences. If but one of those overgrown manufactures, which by means
 either of bounties or of the monopoly of the home and colony markets,
have been artificially raised up to an unnatural height, finds some
small stop or interruption in its employment, it frequently occasions a
mutiny and disorder alarming to government, and embarrassing even to the
 deliberations of the legislature. How great, therefore, would be the
disorder and confusion, it was thought, which must necessarily be
occasioned by a sudden and entire stop in the employment of so great a
proportion of our principal manufacturers?</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_313"><span class="type-margin"><span>The gradual relaxation of the monopoly is desirable</span></span>Some
 moderate and gradual relaxation of the laws which give to Great Britain
 the exclusive trade to the colonies, till it is rendered in a great
measure free, seems to be the only expedient which can, in all future
times,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt206" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt206_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 deliver her from this danger, which can enable her or even force her to
 withdraw some part of her capital from this overgrown employment, and
to turn it, though with less profit, towards other employments; and
which, by gradually diminishing one branch of her industry and gradually
 increasing all the rest, can by degrees restore all the different
branches of it to that natural, healthful, and proper proportion which
perfect liberty necessarily establishes, and which perfect liberty can
alone preserve. To open the colony trade all at once to all nations,
might not only occasion some transitory inconveniency, but a great
permanent loss to the greater part of those whose industry or capital is
 at present engaged in it. The sudden loss of the employment even of the
 ships which import the eighty-two thousand hogsheads of tobacco, which
are over and above the consumption of Great Britain, might alone be felt
 very sensibly. Such are the unfortunate effects of all the regulations
of the mercantile system! They not only introduce very dangerous
disorders into the state of the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>107<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 body politic, but disorders which it is often difficult to remedy,
without occasioning, for a time at least, still greater disorders. In
what manner, therefore, the colony trade ought gradually to be opened;
what are the restraints which ought first, and what are those which
ought last to be taken away; or in what manner the natural system of

<p id="Smith_0206-02_314">Five different events, unforeseen and unthought of, have very<span class="type-margin"><span>The

 fortunately concurred to hinder Great Britain from feeling, so sensibly
 as it was generally expected she would, the total exclusion which has
now taken place for more than a year (from the first of December, 1774)<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt207" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt207_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 from a very important branch of the colony trade, that of the twelve
associated provinces of North America. First, those colonies, in
preparing themselves for their non-importation agreement, drained Great
Britain completely of all the commodities which were fit for their
market: secondly, the extraordinary demand of the Spanish Flota<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt208" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt208_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 has, this year, drained Germany and the North of many commodities,
linen in particular, which used to come into competition, even in the
British market, with the manufactures of Great Britain: thirdly, the
peace between Russia and Turkey,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt209" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt209_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 has occasioned an extraordinary demand from the Turkey market, which,
during the distress of the country, and while a Russian fleet was
cruizing in the Archipelago, had been very poorly supplied: fourthly,
the demand of the North of Europe for the manufactures of Great Britain,
 has been increasing from year to year for some time past: and, fifthly,
 the late partition<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt210" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt210_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 and consequential pacification of Poland, by opening the market of that
 great country, have this year added an extraordinary demand from thence
 to the increasing demand of the North. These events are all, except the
 fourth, in their nature transitory and accidental, and the exclusion
from so important a branch of the colony trade, if unfortunately it
should continue much longer, may still occasion some degree of distress.
 This distress, however, as it will come on gradually, will be felt much
 less severely than if it had come on all at once; and, in the mean
time, the industry and capital of the country may <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>108<span class="bracket">]</span></span> find a new employment and direction, so as to prevent this distress<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt211" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt211_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> from ever rising to any considerable height.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_315"><span class="type-margin"><span>The monopoly is bad,</span></span>The
 monopoly of the colony trade, therefore, so far as it has turned
towards that trade a greater proportion of the capital of Great Britain
than what would otherwise have gone to it, has in all cases turned it,
from a foreign trade of consumption with a neighbouring, into one with a
 more distant country; in many cases, from a direct foreign trade of
consumption, into a round-about one; and in some cases, from all foreign
 trade of consumption, into a carrying trade. It has in all cases,
therefore, turned it, from a direction in which it would have maintained
 a greater quantity of productive labour, into one, in which it can
maintain a much smaller quantity. By suiting, besides, to one particular
 market only, so great a part of the industry and commerce of Great
Britain, it has rendered the whole state of that industry and commerce
more precarious and less secure, than if their produce had been
accommodated to a greater variety of markets.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_316"><span class="type-margin"><span>but the trade itself is good</span></span>We
 must carefully distinguish between the effects of the colony trade and
those of the monopoly of that trade. The former are always and
necessarily beneficial; the latter always and necessarily hurtful. But
the former are so beneficial, that the colony trade, though subject to a
 monopoly, and notwithstanding the hurtful effects of that monopoly, is
still upon the whole beneficial, and greatly beneficial; though a good
deal less so than it otherwise would be.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_317"><span class="type-margin"><span>The trade in its natural state increases the productive labour of Great Britain.</span></span>The
 effect of the colony trade in its natural and free state, is to open a
great, though distant market for such parts of the produce of British
industry as may exceed the demand of the markets nearer home, of those
of Europe, and of the countries which lie round the Mediterranean sea.
In its natural and free state, the colony trade, without drawing from
those markets any part of the produce which had ever been sent to them,
encourages Great Britain to increase the surplus continually, by
continually presenting new equivalents to be exchanged for it. In its
natural and free state, the colony trade tends to increase the quantity
of productive labour in Great Britain, but without altering in any
respect the direction of that which had been employed there before. In
the natural and free state of the colony trade, the competition of all
other nations would hinder the rate of profit from rising above the
common level either in the new market, or in the new employment. The new
 market, without drawing any thing from the old one, would create, if
one may say so, a new produce for its own supply; and that new produce
would constitute a new capital for carrying <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>109<span class="bracket">]</span></span> on the new employment, which in the same manner would draw nothing from the old one.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_318">The monopoly of the colony trade, on the contrary, by excluding the<span class="type-margin"><span>The monopoly diminishes it.</span></span>
 competition of other nations, and thereby raising the rate of profit
both in the new market and in the new employment, draws produce from the
 old market and capital from the old employment. To augment our share of
 the colony trade beyond what it otherwise would be, is the avowed
purpose of the monopoly. If our share of that trade were to be no
greater with, than it would have been without the monopoly, there could
have been no reason for establishing the monopoly. But whatever forces
into a branch of trade of which the returns are slower and more distant
than those of the greater part of other trades, a greater proportion of
the capital of any country, than what of its own accord would go to that
 branch, necessarily renders the whole quantity of productive labour
annually maintained there, the whole annual produce of the land and
labour of that country, less than they otherwise would be. It keeps down
 the revenue of the inhabitants of that country, below what it would
naturally rise to, and thereby diminishes their power of accumulation.
It not only hinders, at all times, their capital from maintaining so
great a quantity of productive labour as it would otherwise maintain,
but it hinders it from increasing so fast as it would otherwise
increase, and consequently from maintaining a still greater quantity of
productive labour.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_319">The natural good effects of the colony trade, however, more than<span class="type-margin"><span>The natural good effects of the trade more than counterbalance the bad effects of the monopoly</span></span>
 counterbalance to Great Britain the bad effects of the monopoly, so
that, monopoly and all together, that trade, even as it is carried on at
 present, is not only advantageous, but greatly advantageous. The new
market and the new employment<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt212" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt212_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 which are opened by the colony trade, are of much greater extent than
that portion of the old market and of the old employment which is lost
by the monopoly. The new produce and the new capital which has been
created, if one may say so, by the colony trade, maintain in Great
Britain a greater quantity of productive labour, than what can have been
 thrown out of employment by the revulsion of capital from other trades
of which the returns are more frequent. If the colony trade, however,
even as it is carried on at present, is advantageous to Great Britain,
it is not by means of the monopoly, but in spite of the monopoly.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_320">It is rather for the manufactured than for the rude produce of Europe,<span class="type-margin"><span>The colonies offer a market for the manufactured rather than the rude produce of Europe,</span></span>
 that the colony trade opens a new market. Agriculture is the proper
business of all new colonies; a business which the cheapness of land
renders more advantageous than any other. They abound, therefore, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>110<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 in the rude produce of land, and instead of importing it from other
countries, they have generally a large surplus to export. In new
colonies, agriculture either draws hands from all other employments, or
keeps them from going to any other employment. There are few hands to
spare for the necessary, and none for the ornamental manufactures. The
greater part of the manufactures of both kinds, they find it cheaper to
purchase of other countries than to make for themselves. It is chiefly
by encouraging the manufactures of Europe, that the colony trade
indirectly encourages its agriculture. The manufacturers of Europe, to
whom that trade gives employment, constitute a new market for the
produce of the land; and the most advantageous of all markets; the home
market for the corn and cattle, for the bread and butcher’s-meat of
Europe; is thus greatly extended by means of the trade to America.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_321"><span class="type-margin"><span>but the monopoly has not maintained the manufactures of Spain and Portugal,</span></span>But
 that the monopoly of the trade of populous and thriving colonies is not
 alone sufficient to establish, or even to maintain manufactures in any
country, the examples of Spain and Portugal sufficiently demonstrate.
Spain and Portugal were manufacturing countries before they had any
considerable colonies. Since they had the richest and most fertile in
the world, they have both ceased to be so.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_322"><span class="type-margin"><span>where the bad effects of the monopoly have nearly overbalanced the good effects of the trade</span></span>In Spain and Portugal, the bad effects of the monopoly, aggravated by other causes, have, perhaps, nearly overbalanced<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt213" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt213_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 the natural good effects of the colony trade. These causes seem to be,
other monopolies of different kinds; the degradation of the value of
gold and silver below what it is in most other countries; the exclusion
from foreign markets by improper taxes upon exportation, and the
narrowing of the home market, by still more improper taxes upon the
transportation of goods from one part of the country to another; but
above all, that irregular and partial administration of justice, which
often protects the rich and powerful debtor from the pursuit of his
injured creditor, and which makes the industrious part of the nation
afraid to prepare goods for the consumption of those haughty and great
men, to whom they dare not refuse to sell upon credit, and from whom
they are altogether uncertain of repayment.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_323"><span class="type-margin"><span>In England the good effects of the trade have greatly counteracted the bad effects of the monopoly.</span></span>In
 England, on the contrary, the natural good effects of the colony trade,
 assisted by other causes, have in a great measure conquered the bad
effects of the monopoly. These causes seem to be, the general liberty of
 trade, which, notwithstanding some restraints, is at least equal,
perhaps superior, to what it is in any other country; the liberty of
exporting, duty free, almost all sorts of goods which are the produce <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>111<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of domestic industry, to almost any foreign country; and what, perhaps,
 is of still greater importance, the unbounded liberty of transporting
them from any one part of our own country to any other, without being
obliged to give any account to any public office, without being liable
to question or examination of any kind; but above all, that equal and
impartial administration of justice which renders the rights of the
meanest British subject respectable to the greatest, and which, by
securing to every man the fruits of his own industry, gives the greatest
 and most effectual encouragement to every sort of industry.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_324">If the manufactures of Great Britain, however, have been advanced,<span class="type-margin"><span>The trade has benefited British manufactures in spite of the monopoly, not in consequence of it</span></span>
 as they certainly have, by the colony trade, it has not been by means
of the monopoly of that trade, but in spite of the monopoly. The effect
of the monopoly has been, not to augment the quantity, but to alter the
quality and shape of a part of the manufactures of Great Britain, and to
 accommodate to a market, from which the returns are slow and distant,
what would otherwise have been accommodated to one from which the
returns are frequent and near. Its effect has consequently been to turn a
 part of the capital of Great Britain from an employment in which it
would have maintained a greater quantity of manufacturing industry, to
one in which it maintains a much smaller, and thereby to diminish,
instead of increasing, the whole quantity of manufacturing industry
maintained in Great Britain.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_325">The monopoly of the colony trade, therefore,
like all the other mean and malignant expedients of the mercantile
system, depresses the industry of all other countries, but chiefly that
of the colonies, without in the least increasing, but on the contrary
diminishing, that of the country in whose favour it is established.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_326">The monopoly hinders the capital of that country, whatever may at<span class="type-margin"><span>The monopoly reduces wages in the mother country</span></span>
 any particular time be the extent of that capital, from maintaining so
great a quantity of productive labour as it would otherwise maintain,
and from affording so great a revenue to the industrious inhabitants as
it would otherwise afford. But as capital can be increased only by
savings from revenue, the monopoly, by hindering it from affording so
great a revenue as it would otherwise afford, necessarily hinders it
from increasing so fast as it would otherwise increase, and consequently
 from maintaining a still greater quantity of productive labour, and
affording a still greater revenue to the industrious inhabitants of that
 country. One great original source of revenue, therefore, the wages of
labour, the monopoly must necessarily have rendered at all times less
abundant than it otherwise would have been.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>112<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_327"><span class="type-margin"><span>raisesprofits, and thereby tends to lower rents and the price of land.</span></span>By
 raising the rate of mercantile profit, the monopoly discourages the
improvement of land. The profit of improvement depends upon the
difference between what the land actually produces, and what, by the
application of a certain capital, it can be made to produce. If this
difference affords a greater profit than what can be drawn from an equal
 capital in any mercantile employment, the improvement of land will draw
 capital from all mercantile employments. If the profit is less,
mercantile employments will draw capital from the improvement of land.
Whatever therefore raises the rate of mercantile profit, either lessens
the superiority or increases the inferiority of the profit of
improvement; and in the one case hinders capital from going to
improvement, and in the other draws capital from it. But by discouraging
 improvement, the monopoly necessarily retards the natural increase of
another great original source of revenue, the rent of land. By raising
the rate of profit too, the monopoly necessarily keeps up the market
rate of interest higher than it otherwise would be. But the price of
land in proportion to the rent which it affords, the number of years
purchase which is commonly paid for it, necessarily falls as the rate of
 interest rises, and rises as the rate of interest falls. The monopoly,
therefore, hurts the interest of the landlord two different ways, by
retarding the natural increase, first, of his rent, and secondly, of the
 price which he would get for his land in proportion to the rent which
it affords.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_328"><span class="type-margin"><span>It reduces the absolute amount of profit,</span></span>The
 monopoly, indeed, raises the rate of mercantile profit, and thereby
augments somewhat the gain of our merchants. But as it obstructs the
natural increase of capital, it tends rather to diminish than to
increase the sum total of the revenue which the inhabitants of the
country derive from the profits of stock; a small profit upon a great
capital generally affording a greater revenue than a great profit upon a
 small one. The monopoly raises the rate of profit, but it hinders the
sum of profit from rising so high as it otherwise would do.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_329"><span class="type-margin"><span>thus rendering all the original sources of revenue less abundant.</span></span>All
 the original sources of revenue, the wages of labour, the rent of land,
 and the profits of stock, the monopoly renders much less abundant than
they otherwise would be. To promote the little interest of one little
order of men in one country, it hurts the interest of all other orders
of men in that country, and of all men in all other countries.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_330"><span class="type-margin"><span>More fatal still, it destroys parsimony.</span></span>It
 is solely by raising the ordinary rate of profit that the monopoly
either has proved or could prove advantageous to any one particular
order of men. But besides all the bad effects to the country in general,
 which have already been mentioned as necessarily resulting from a high
rate of profit; there is one more fatal, perhaps, than all these put <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>113<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 together, but which, if we may judge from experience, is inseparably
connected with it. The high rate of profit seems every where to destroy
that parsimony which in other circumstances is natural to the character
of the merchant. When profits are high, that sober virtue seems to be
superfluous, and expensive luxury to suit better the affluence of his
situation. But the owners of the great mercantile capitals are
necessarily the leaders and conductors of the whole industry of every
nation, and their example has a much greater influence upon the manners
of the whole industrious part of it than that of any other order of men.
 If his employer is attentive and parsimonious, the workman is very
likely to be so too; but if the master is dissolute and disorderly, the
servant who shapes his work according to the pattern which his master
prescribes to him, will shape his life too according to the example
which he sets him. Accumulation is thus prevented in the hands of all
those who are naturally the most disposed to accumulate; and the funds
destined for the maintenance of productive labour receive no
augmentation from the revenue of those who ought naturally to augment
them the most. The capital of the country, instead of increasing,
gradually dwindles away, and the quantity of productive labour
maintained in it grows every day less and less. Have the exorbitant
profits of the merchants of Cadiz and Lisbon augmented the capital of
Spain and Portugal? Have they alleviated the poverty, have they promoted
 the industry of those two beggarly countries? Such has been the tone of
 mercantile expence in those two trading cities, that those exorbitant
profits, far from augmenting the general capital of the country, seem
scarce to have been sufficient to keep up the capitals upon which they
were made. Foreign capitals are every day intruding themselves, if I may
 say so, more and more into the trade of Cadiz and Lisbon. It is to
expel those foreign capitals from a trade which their own<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt214" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt214_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 grows every day more and more insufficient for carrying on, that the
Spaniards and Portuguese endeavour every day to straiten more and more
the galling bands of their absurd monopoly. Compare the mercantile
manners of Cadiz and Lisbon with those of Amsterdam, and you will be
sensible how differently the conduct and character of merchants are
affected by the high and by the low profits of stock. The merchants of
London, indeed, have not yet generally become such magnificent lords as
those of Cadiz and Lisbon; but neither are they in general such
attentive and parsimonious burghers as those of Amsterdam. They are
supposed, however, many of them, to be a good deal richer than the
greater part of the former, and not <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>114<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 quite so rich as many of the latter. But the rate of their profit is
commonly much lower than that of the former, and a good deal higher than
 that of the latter. Light come light go, says the proverb; and the
ordinary tone of expence seems every where to be regulated, not so much
according to the real ability of spending, as to the supposed facility
of getting money to spend.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_331">It is thus that the single advantage which the
 monopoly procures to a single order of men, is in many different ways
hurtful to the general interest of the country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_332"><span class="type-margin"><span>The policy of the monopoly is a policy of shopkeepers.</span></span>To
 found a great empire for the sole purpose of raising up a people of
customers, may at first sight appear a project fit only for a nation of
shopkeepers. It is, however, a project altogether unfit for a nation of
shopkeepers; but extremely fit for a nation whose government is
influenced by shopkeepers. Such statesmen, and such statesmen only,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt215" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt215_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 are capable of fancying that they will find some advantage in employing
 the blood and treasure of their fellow-citizens, to found and maintain<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt216" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt216_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 such an empire. Say to a shopkeeper, Buy me a good estate, and I shall
always buy my clothes at your shop, even though I should pay somewhat
dearer than what I can have them for at other shops; and you will not
find him very forward to embrace your proposal. But should any other
person buy you such an estate, the shopkeeper would be much obliged to
your benefactor if he would enjoin you to buy all your clothes at his
shop. England purchased for some of her subjects, who found themselves
uneasy at home, a great estate in a distant country. The price, indeed,
was very small, and instead of thirty years purchase, the ordinary price
 of land in the present times, it amounted to little more than the
expence of the different equipments which made the first discovery,
reconnoited the coast, and took a fictitious possession of the country.
The land was good and of great extent, and the cultivators having plenty
 of good ground to work upon, and being for some time at liberty to sell
 their produce where they pleased, became in the course of little more
than thirty or forty years (between 1620 and 1660) so numerous and
thriving a people, that the shopkeepers and other traders of England
wished to secure to themselves the monopoly of their custom. Without
pretending, therefore, that they had paid any part, either of the
original purchase-money, or of the subsequent expence of improvement,
they petitioned the parliament that the cultivators of America might for
 the future be confined to their shop; first, for buying all the goods
which they wanted from <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>115<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 Europe; and, secondly, for selling all such parts of their own produce
as those traders might find it convenient to buy. For they did not find
it convenient to buy every part of it. Some parts of it imported into
England might have interfered with some of the trades which they
themselves carried on at home. Those particular parts of it, therefore,
they were willing that the colonists should sell where they could; the
farther off the better; and upon that account proposed that their market
 should be confined to the countries south of Cape Finisterre. A clause
in the famous act of navigation established this truly shopkeeper
proposal into a law.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_333">The maintenance of this monopoly has hitherto been the principal,<span class="type-margin"><span>The expenditure of Great Britain on the colonies has all been laid out to support the monopoly, and is enormous.</span></span>
 or more properly perhaps the sole end and purpose of the dominion which
 Great Britain assumes over her colonies. In the exclusive trade, it is
supposed, consists the great advantage of provinces, which have never
yet afforbed either revenue or military force for the support of the
civil government, or the defence of the mother country. The monopoly is
the principal badge of their dependency, and it is the sole fruit which
has hitherto been gathered from that dependency. Whatever expence Great
Britain has hitherto laid out in maintaining this dependency, has really
 been laid out in order to support this monopoly. The expence of the
ordinary peace establishment of the colonies amounted, before the
commencement of the present disturbances, to the pay of twenty regiments
 of foot; to the expence of the artillery, stores, and extraordinary
provisions with which it was<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt217" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt217_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 necessary to supply them; and to the expence of a very considerable
naval force which was constantly kept up, in order to guard, from the
smuggling vessels of other nations, the immense coast of North America,
and that of our West Indian islands. The whole expence of this peace
establishment was a charge upon the revenue of Great Britain, and was,
at the same time, the smallest part of what the dominion of the colonies
 has cost the mother country. If we would know the amount of the whole,
we must add to the annual expence of this peace establishment the
interest of the sums which, in consequence of her considering her
colonies as provinces subject to her dominion, Great Britain has upon
different occasions laid out upon their defence. We must add to it, in
particular, the whole expence of the late war, and a great part of that
of the war which preceded it.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt218" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt218_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 The late war was altogether a colony quarrel, and the whole expence of
it, in whatever part of the world it may have been laid out, whether in
Germany or the East Indies, ought justly to be stated to the account of
the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>116<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 colonies. It amounted to more than ninety millions sterling, including
not only the new debt which was contracted, but the two shillings in the
 pound additional land tax, and the sums which were every year borrowed
from the sinking fund. The Spanish war which began in 1739, was
principally a colony quarrel. Its principal object was to prevent the
search of the colony ships which carried on a contraband trade with the
Spanish main. This whole expence is, in reality, a bounty which has been
 given in order to support a monopoly. The pretended purpose of it was
to encourage the manufactures, and to increase the commerce of Great
Britain. But its real effect has been to raise the rate of mercantile
profit, and to enable our merchants to turn into a branch of trade, of
which the returns are more slow and distant than those of the greater
part of other trades, a greater proportion of their capital than they
otherwise would have done; two events which if a bounty could have
prevented, it might perhaps have been very well worth while to give such
 a bounty.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_334">Under the present system of management,
therefore, Great Britain derives nothing but loss from the dominion
which she assumes over her colonies.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_335"><span class="type-margin"><span>A voluntary separation would be very advantageous</span></span>To
 propose that Great Britain should voluntarily give up all authority
over her colonies, and leave them to elect their own magistrates, to
enact their own laws, and to make peace and war as they might think
proper, would be to propose such a measure as never was, and never will
be adopted, by any nation in the world. No nation ever voluntarily gave
up the dominion of any province, how troublesome soever it might be to
govern it, and how small soever the revenue which it afforded might be
in proportion to the expence which it occasioned. Such sacrifices,
though they might frequently be agreeable to the interest, are always
mortifying to the pride of every nation, and what is perhaps of still
greater consequence, they are always contrary to the private interest of
 the governing part of it, who would thereby be deprived of the disposal
 of many places of trust and profit, of many opportunities of acquiring
wealth and distinction, which the possession of the most turbulent, and,
 to the great body of the people, the most unprofitable province seldom
fails to afford. The most visionary enthusiast would scarce be capable
of proposing such a measure, with any serious hopes at least of its ever
 being adopted. If it was adopted, however, Great Britain would not only
 be immediately freed from the whole annual expence of the peace
establishment of the colonies, but might settle with them such a treaty
of commerce as would effectually secure to her a free trade, more
advantageous to the great body of the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>117<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 people, though less so to the merchants, than the monopoly which she at
 present enjoys. By thus parting good friends, the natural affection of
the colonies to the mother country, which, perhaps, our late dissensions
 have well nigh extinguished, would quickly revive. It might dispose
them not only to respect, for whole centuries together, that treaty of
commerce which they had concluded with us at parting, but to favour us
in war as well as in trade, and, instead of turbulent and factious
subjects, to become our most faithful, affectionate, and generous
allies; and the same sort of parental affection on the one side, and
filial respect on the other, might revive between Great Britain and her
colonies, which used to subsist between those of ancient Greece and the
mother city from which they descended.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_336">In order to render any province advantageous to the empire to which<span class="type-margin"><span>The colonies do not furnish nearly sufficient revenue to make them advantageous</span></span>
 it belongs, it ought to afford, in time of peace, a revenue to the
public sufficient not only for defraying the whole expence of its own
peace establishment, but for contributing its proportion to the support
of the general government of the empire. Every province necessarily
contributes, more or less, to increase the expence of that general
government. If any particular province, therefore, does not contribute
its share towards defraying this expence, an unequal burden must be
thrown upon some other part of the empire. The extraordinary revenue too
 which every province affords to the public in time of war, ought, from
parity of reason, to bear the same proportion to the extraordinary
revenue of the whole empire which its ordinary revenue does in time of
peace. That neither the ordinary nor extraordinary revenue which Great
Britain derives from her colonies, bears this proportion to the whole
revenue of the British empire, will readily be allowed. The monopoly, it
 has been supposed, indeed, by increasing the private revenue of the
people of Great Britain, and thereby enabling them to pay greater taxes,
 compensates the deficiency of the public revenue of the colonies. But
this monopoly, I have endeavoured to show, though a very grievous tax
upon the colonies, and though it may increase the revenue of a
particular order of men in Great Britain, diminishes instead of
increasing that of the great body of the people; and consequently
diminishes instead of increasing the ability of the great body of the
people to pay taxes. The men too whose revenue the monopoly increases,
constitute a particular order, which it is both absolutely impossible to
 tax beyond the proportion of other orders, and extremely impolitic even
 to attempt to tax beyond that proportion, as I shall endeavour to shew
in the following book.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt219" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt219_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>118<span class="bracket">]</span></span> No particular resource, therefore, can be drawn from this particular order.</p>

<p id="Smith_0206-02_338"><span class="type-margin"><span>The colonial assemblies will never vote enough,</span></span>That
 the colony assemblies can ever be so managed as to levy upon their
constituents a public revenue sufficient, not only to maintain at all
times their own civil and military establishment, but to pay their
proper proportion of the expence of the general government of the
British empire, seems not very probable. It was a long time before even
the parliament of England, though placed immediately under the eye of
the sovereign, could be brought under such a system of management, or
could be rendered sufficiently liberal in their grants for supporting
the civil and military establishments even of their own country. It was
only by distributing among the particular members of parliament, a great
 part either of the offices, or of the disposal of the offices arising
from this civil and military establishment, that such a system of
management could be established even with regard to the parliament of
England. But the distance of the colony assemblies from the eye of the
sovereign, their number, their dispersed situation, and their various
constitutions, would render it very difficult to manage them in the same
 manner, even though the sovereign had the same means of doing it; and
those means are wanting. It would be absolutely impossible to distribute
 among all the leading members of all the colony assemblies such a
share, either of the offices or of the disposal of the offices arising
from the general government of the British empire, as to dispose them to
 give up their popularity at home, and to tax their constituents for the
 support of that general government, of which almost the whole
emoluments were to be divided among people who were strangers to them.
The unavoidable ignorance of administration, besides, concerning the
relative importance of the different members of those different
assemblies, the offences which must frequently be given, the blunders
which must constantly be committed in attempting to manage them in this
manner, seems<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt220" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt220_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> to render such a system of management altogether impracticable with regard to them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_339"><span class="type-margin"><span>and have no knowledge of what is required</span></span>The
 colony assemblies, besides, cannot be supposed the proper judges of
what is necessary for the defence and support of the whole empire. The
care of that defence and support is not entrusted to them. It is not
their business, and they have no regular means of information concerning
 it. The assembly of a province, like the vestry of a parish, may judge
very properly concerning the affairs of its own <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>119<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 particular district; but can have no proper means of judging concerning
 those of the whole empire. It cannot even judge properly concerning the
 proportion which its own province bears to the whole empire; or
concerning the relative degree of its wealth and importance, compared
with the other provinces; because those other provinces are not under
the inspection and superintendency of the assembly of a particular
province. What is necessary for the defence and support of the whole
empire, and in what proportion each part ought to contribute, can be
judged of only by that assembly which inspects and superintends the
affairs of the whole empire.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_340">It has been proposed, accordingly, that the colonies should be taxed<span class="type-margin"><span>It has been proposed that parliament should tax the colonies by requisition,</span></span>by
 requisition, the parliament of Great Britain determining the sum which
each colony ought to pay, and the provincial assembly assessing and
levying it in the way that suited best the circumstances of the
province. What concerned the whole empire would in this way be
determined by the assembly which inspects and superintends the affairs
of the whole empire; and the provincial affairs of each colony might
still be regulated by its own assembly. Though the colonies should in
this case have no representatives in the British parliament, yet, if we
may judge by experience, there is no probability that the parliamentary
requisition would be unreasonable. The parliament of England has not
upon any occasion shown the smallest disposition to overburden those
parts of the empire which are not represented in parliament. The islands
 of Guernsey and Jersey, without any means of resisting the authority of
 parliament, are more lightly taxed than any part of Great Britain.
Parliament in attempting to exercise its supposed right, whether well or
 ill grounded, of taxing the colonies, has never hitherto demanded of
them any thing which even approached to a just proportion to what was
paid by their fellow-subjects at home. If the contribution of the
colonies, besides, was to rise or fall in proportion to the rise or fall
 of the land tax, parliament could not tax them without taxing at the
same time its own constituents, and the colonies might in this case be
considered as virtually represented in parliament.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_341">Examples are not wanting of empires in which all the different<span class="type-margin"><span>as the King of France taxes some of his provinces.</span></span>provinces
 are not taxed, if I may be allowed the expression, in one mass; but in
which the sovereign regulates the sum which each province ought to pay,
and in some provinces assesses and levies it as he thinks proper; while
in others, he leaves it to be assessed and levied as the respective
states of each province shall determine. In some provinces of France,
the king not only imposes what taxes he thinks proper, but assesses and
levies them in the way he thinks <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>120<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 proper. From others he demands a certain sum, but leaves it to the
states of each province to assess and levy that sum as they think
proper. According to the scheme of taxing by requisition, the parliament
 of Great Britain would stand nearly in the same situation towards the
colony assemblies, as the king of France does towards the states of
those provinces which still enjoy the privilege of having states of
their own, the provinces of France which are supposed to be the best
governed.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_342"><span class="type-margin"><span>but parliament has not sufficient authority,</span></span>But
 though, according to this scheme, the colonies could have no just
reason to fear that their share of the public burdens should ever exceed
 the proper proportion to that of their fellow-citizens at home; Great
Britain might have just reason to fear that it never would amount to
that proper proportion. The parliament of Great Britain has not for some
 time past had the same established authority in the colonies, which the
 French king has in those provinces of France which still enjoy the
privilege of having states of their own. The colony assemblies, if they
were not very favourably disposed (and unless more skilfully managed
than they ever have been hitherto, they are not very likely to be so),
might still find many pretences for evading or rejecting the most
reasonable requisitions of parliament. A French war breaks out, we shall
 suppose; ten millions must immediately be raised, in order to defend
the seat of the empire. This sum must be borrowed upon the credit of
some parliamentary fund mortgaged for paying the interest. Part of this
fund parliament proposes to raise by a tax to be levied in Great
Britain, and part of it by a requisition to all the different colony
assemblies of America and the West Indies. Would people readily advance
their money upon the credit of a fund, which partly depended upon the
good humour of all those assemblies, far distant from the seat of the
war, and sometimes, perhaps, thinking themselves not much concerned in
the event of it? Upon such a fund no more money would probably be
advanced than what the tax to be levied in Great Britain might be
supposed to answer for. The whole burden of the debt contracted on
account of the war would in this manner fall, as it always has done
hitherto, upon Great Britain; upon a part of the empire, and not upon
the whole empire. Great Britain is, perhaps, since the world began, the
only state which, as it has extended its empire, has only increased its
expence without once augmenting its resources. Other states have
generally disburdened themselves upon their subject and subordinate
provinces of the most considerable part of the expence of defending the
empire. Great Britain has hitherto suffered her subject and subordinate
provinces to disburden themselves upon her of almost this whole expence.
 In order to put Great Britain <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>121<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 upon a footing of equality with her own colonies, which the law has
hitherto supposed to be subject and subordinate, it seems necessary,
upon the scheme of taxing them by parliamentary requisition, that
parliament should have some means of rendering its requisitions
immediately effectual, in case the colony assemblies should attempt to
evade or reject them; and what those means are, it is not very easy to
conceive, and it has not yet been explained.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_343">Should the parliament of Great Britain, at the same time, be ever<span class="type-margin"><span>and resistance breaks cut.</span></span>
 fully established in the right of taxing the colonies, even independent
 of the consent of their own assemblies, the importance of those
assemblies would from that moment be at an end, and with it, that of all
 the leading men of British America. Men desire to have some share in
the management of public affairs chiefly on account of the importance
which it gives them. Upon the power which the greater part of the
leading men, the natural aristocracy of every country, have of
preserving or defending their respective importance, depends the
stability and duration of every system of free government. In the
attacks which those leading men are continually making upon the
importance of one another, and in the defence of their own, consists the
 whole play of domestic faction and ambition. The leading men of
America, like those of all other countries, desire to preserve their own
 importance. They feel, or imagine, that if their assemblies, which they
 are fond of calling parliaments, and of considering as equal in
authority to the parliament of Great Britain, should be so far degraded
as to become the humble ministers and executive officers of that
parliament, the greater part of their own importance would be at an end.
 They have rejected, therefore, the proposal of being taxed by
parliamentary requisition, and like other ambitious and high-spirited
men, have rather chosen to draw the sword in defence of their own
importance.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_344">Towards the declension of the Roman republic, the allies of Rome,<span class="type-margin"><span>Representation in parliament in proportion to taxation should be offered</span></span>
 who had borne the principal burden of defending the state and extending
 the empire, demanded to be admitted to all the privileges of Roman
citizens. Upon being refused, the social war broke out. During the
course of that war Rome granted those privileges to the greater part of
them, one by one, and in proportion as they detached themselves from the
 general confederacy. The parliament of Great Britain insists upon
taxing the colonies; and they refuse to be taxed by a parliament in
which they are not represented. If to each colony, which should detach
itself from the general confederacy, Great Britain should allow such a
number of representatives as suited the proportion of what it
contributed to the public revenue of the empire, in consequence <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>122<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of its being subjected to the same taxes, and in compensation admitted
to the same freedom of trade with its fellow-subjects at home; the
number of its representatives to be augmented as the proportion of its
contribution might afterwards augment; a new method of acquiring
importance, a new and more dazzling object of ambition would be
presented to the leading men of each colony. Instead of piddling for the
 little prizes which are to be found in what may be called the paltry
raffle of colony faction; they might then hope, from the presumption
which men naturally have in their own ability and good fortune, to draw
some of the great prizes which sometimes come from the wheel of the
great state lottery of British politics.<span class="type-margin"><span>Otherwise it seems hopeless to expect submission,</span></span>
 Unless this or some other method is fallen upon, and there seems to be
none more obvious than this, of preserving the importance and of
gratifying the ambition of the leading men of America, it is not very
probable that they will ever voluntarily submit to us; and we ought to
consider that the blood which must be shed in forcing them to do so, is,
 every drop of it, the blood either of those who are, or of those whom
we wish to have for our fellow-citizens. They are very weak who flatter
themselves that, in the state to which things have come, our colonies
will be easily conquered by force alone. The persons who now govern the
resolutions of what they call their continental congress, feel in
themselves at this moment a degree of importance which, perhaps, the
greatest subjects in Europe scarce feel. From shopkeepers, tradesmen,
and attornies, they are become statesmen and legislators, and are
employed in contriving a new form of government for an extensive empire,
 which, they flatter themselves, will become, and which, indeed, seems
very likely to become, one of the greatest and most formidable that ever
 was in the world. Five hundred different people, perhaps, who in
different ways act immediately under the continental congress; and five
hundred thousand, perhaps, who act under those five hundred, all feel in
 the same manner a proportionable rise in their own importance. Almost
every individual of the governing party in America, fills, at present in
 his own fancy, a station superior, not only to what he had ever filled
before, but to what he had ever expected to fill; and unless some new
object of ambition is presented either to him or to his leaders, if he
has the ordinary spirit of a man, he will die in defence of that
station.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_345"><span class="type-margin"><span>and resistance will be as obstinate as that of Paris.</span></span>It
 is a remark of the president Henaut, that we now read with pleasure the
 account of many little transactions of the Ligue, which when they
happened were not perhaps considered as very important pieces of news.
But every man then, says he, fancied himself of some <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>123<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 importance; and the innumerable memoirs which have come down to us from
 those times were, the greater part of them, written by people who took
pleasure in recording and magnifying events in which, they flattered
themselves, they had been considerable actors.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt221" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt221_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 How obstinately the city of Paris upon that occasion defended itself,
what a dreadful famine it supported rather than submit to the best and
afterwards<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt222" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt222_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 the most beloved of all the French kings, is well known. The greater
part of the citizens, or those who governed the greater part of them,
fought in defence of their own importance, which they foresaw was to be
at an end whenever the ancient government should be re-established. Our
colonies, unless they can be induced to consent to a union, are very
likely to defend themselves against the best of all mother countries, as
 obstinately as the city of Paris did against one of the best of kings.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_346">The idea of representation was unknown in ancient times. When<span class="type-margin"><span>The discovery of representation makes the case different from that of Rome and Italy.</span></span>
 the people of one state were admitted to the right of citizenship in
another, they had no other means of exercising that right but by coming
in a body to vote and deliberate with the people of that other state.
The admission of the greater part of the inhabitants of Italy to the
privileges of Roman citizens, completely ruined the Roman republic. It
was no longer possible to distinguish between who was and who was not a
Roman citizen. No tribe could know its own members. A rabble of any kind
 could be introduced into the assemblies of the people, could drive out
the real citizens, and decide upon the affairs of the republic as if
they themselves had been such. But though America were<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt223" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt223_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 to send fifty or sixty new representatives to parliament, the
door-keeper of the house of commons could not find any great difficulty
in distinguishing between who was and who was not a member. Though the
Roman constitution, therefore, was necessarily ruined by the union of
Rome with the allied states of Italy, there is not the least probability
 that the British constitution would be hurt by the union of Great
Britain with her colonies. That constitution, on the contrary, would be
completed by it, and seems to be imperfect without it. The assembly
which deliberates and decides concerning the affairs <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>124<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of every part of the empire, in order to be properly informed, ought
certainly to have representatives from every part of it. That this
union, however, could be easily effectuated, or that difficulties and
great difficulties might not occur in the execution, I do not pretend. I
 have yet heard of none, however, which appear insurmountable. The
principal perhaps arise, not from the nature of things, but from the
prejudices and opinions of the people both on this and on the other side
 of the Atlantic.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_347"><span class="type-margin"><span>The American representatives could be managed</span></span>We,
 on this side the water, are afraid lest the multitude of American
representatives should overturn the balance of the constitution, and
increase too much either the influence of the crown on the one hand, or
the force of the democracy on the other. But if the number of American
representatives were<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt224" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt224_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 to be in proportion to the produce of American taxation, the number of
people to be managed would increase exactly in proportion to the means
of managing them; and the means of managing, to the number of people to
be managed. The monarchical and democratical parts of the constitution
would, after the union, stand exactly in the same degree of relative
force with regard to one another as they had done before.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_348"><span class="type-margin"><span>The Americans would not be oppressed</span></span>The
 people on the other side of the water are afraid lest their distance
from the seat of government might expose them to many oppressions. But
their representatives in parliament, of which the number ought from the
first to be considerable, would easily be able to protect them from all
oppression. The distance could not much weaken the dependency of the
representative upon the constituent, and the former would still feel
that he owed his seat in parliament, and all the consequence which he
derived from it, to the good-will of the latter. It would be the
interest of the former, therefore, to cultivate that good-will by
complaining, with all the authority of a member of the legislature, of
every outrage which any civil or military officer might be guilty of in
those remote parts of the empire. The distance of America from the seat
of government, besides, the natives<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt225" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt225_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 of that country might flatter themselves, with some appearance of
reason too, would not be of very long continuance. Such has hitherto
been the rapid progress of that country in wealth, population and
improvement, that in the course of little more than a century, perhaps,
the produce of American might exceed that of British taxation. The seat
of the empire would then naturally remove itself to that part of the
empire which contributed most to the general defence and support of the
whole.</p>

<p id="Smith_0206-02_349">The discovery of America, and that of a passage to the East Indies<span class="type-margin"><span>The
 discovery of America and the Cape passage are the greatest events in
history the misfortunes of the natives of the East and West Indies may

 Their consequences have already been very great: but, in the short
period of between two and three centuries which has elapsed since these
discoveries were made, it is impossible that the whole extent of their
consequences can have been seen. What benefits, or what misfortunes to
mankind may hereafter result from those great events, no human wisdom
can foresee. By uniting, in some measure, the most distant parts of the
world, by enabling them to relieve one another’s wants, to increase one
another’s enjoyments, and to encourage one another’s industry, their
general tendency would seem to be beneficial. To the natives, however,
both of the East and West Indies, all the commercial benefits which can
have resulted from those events have been sunk and lost in the dreadful
misfortunes which they have occasioned. These misfortunes, however, seem
 to have arisen rather from accident than from any thing in the nature
of those events themselves. At the particular time when these
discoveries were made, the superiority of force happened to be so great
on the side of the Europeans, that they were enabled to commit with
impunity every sort of injustice in those remote countries. Hereafter,
perhaps, the natives of those countries may grow stronger, or those of
Europe may grow weaker, and the inhabitants of all the different
quarters of the world may arrive at that equality of courage and force
which, by inspiring mutual fear, can alone overawe the injustice of
independent nations into some sort of respect for the rights of one
another. But nothing seems more likely to establish this equality of
force than that mutual communication of knowledge and of all sorts of
improvements which an extensive commerce from all countries to all
countries naturally, or rather necessarily, carries along with it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_350">In the mean time one of the principal effects of those discoveries has<span class="type-margin"><span>Meantime the discovery has exalted the mercantile system</span></span>
 been to raise the mercantile system to a degree of splendour and glory
which it could never otherwise have attained to. It is the object of
that system to enrich a great nation rather by trade and manufactures
than by the improvement and cultivation of land, rather by the industry
of the towns than by that of the country. But, in consequence of those
discoveries, the commercial towns of Europe, instead of being the
manufacturers and carriers for but a very small part of the world (that <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>126<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 part of Europe which is washed by the Atlantic ocean, and the countries
 which lie round the Baltic and Mediterranean seas), have now become the
 manufacturers for the numerous and thriving cultivators of America, and
 the carriers, and in some respects the manufacturers too, for almost
all the different nations of Asia, Africa, and America. Two new worlds
have been opened to their industry, each of them much greater and more
extensive than the old one, and the market of one of them growing still
greater and greater every day.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_351"><span class="type-margin"><span>The countries which possess America and trade to the East Indies appear to get all the advantage, but this is not the case.</span></span>The
 countries which possess the colonies of America, and which trade
directly to the East Indies, enjoy, indeed, the whole shew and splendour
 of this great commerce. Other countries, however, notwithstanding all
the invidious restraints by which it is meant to exclude them,
frequently enjoy a greater share of the real benefit of it. The colonies
 of Spain and Portugal, for example, give more real encouragement to the
 industry of other countries than to that of Spain and Portugal. In the
single article of linen alone the consumption of those colonies amounts,
 it is said, but I do not pretend to warrant the quantity, to more than
three millions sterling a year. But this great consumption is almost
entirely supplied by France, Flanders, Holland, and Germany. Spain and
Portugal furnish but a small part of it. The capital which supplies the
colonies with this great quantity of linen is annually distributed
among, and furnishes a revenue to the inhabitants of those other
countries. The profits of it only are spent in Spain and Portugal, where
 they help to support the sumptuous profusion of the merchants of Cadiz
and Lisbon.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_352"><span class="type-margin"><span>The monopoly regulations sometimes harm the country which establishes them more than others.</span></span>Even
 the regulations by which each nation endeavours to secure to itself the
 exclusive trade of its own colonies, are frequently more hurtful to the
 countries in favour of which they are established than to those against
 which they are established. The unjust oppression of the industry of
other countries falls back, if I may say so, upon the heads of the
oppressors, and crushes their industry more than it does that of those
other countries. By those regulations, for example, the merchant of
Hamburgh must send the linen which he destines for the American market
to London, and he must bring back from thence the tobacco which he
destines for the German market; because he can neither send the one
directly to America, nor bring back the other directly from thence. By
this restraint he is probably obliged to sell the one somewhat cheaper,
and to buy the other somewhat dearer than he otherwise might have done;
and his profits are probably somewhat abridged by means of it. In this
trade, however, between Hamburgh and London, he certainly receives the
returns of his capital much more <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>127<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 quickly than he could possibly have done in the direct trade to
America, even though we should suppose, what is by no means the case,
that the payments of America were as punctual as those of London. In the
 trade, therefore, to which those regulations confine the merchant of
Hamburgh, his capital can keep in constant employment a much greater
quantity of German industry than it possibly could have done in the
trade from which he is excluded. Though the one employment, therefore,
may to him perhaps be less profitable than the other, it cannot be less
advantageous to his country. It is quite otherwise with the employment
into which the monopoly naturally attracts, if I may say so, the capital
 of the London merchant. That employment may, perhaps, be more
profitable to him than the greater part of other employments, but, on
account of the slowness of the returns, it cannot be more advantageous
to his country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_353">After all the unjust attempts, therefore, of every country in Europe<span class="type-margin"><span>The mother countries have engrossed only the expense and inconveniences of possessing colonies.</span></span>
 to engross to itself the whole advantage of the trade of its own
colonies, no country has yet been able to engross to itself any thing
but the expence of supporting in time of peace and of defending in time
of war the oppressive authority which it assumes over them. The
inconveniencies resulting from the possession of its colonies, every
country has engrossed to itself completely. The advantages resulting
from their trade it has been obliged to share with many other countries.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_354">At first sight, no doubt, the monopoly of the great commerce of<span class="type-margin"><span>The monopoly of American trade is a dazzling object</span></span>
 America, naturally seems to be an acquisition of the highest value. To
the undiscerning eye of giddy ambition, it naturally presents itself
amidst the confused scramble of politics and war, as a very dazzling
object to fight for. The dazzling splendour of the object, however, the
immense greatness of the commerce, is the very quality which renders the
 monopoly of it hurtful, or which makes one employment, in its own
nature necessarily less advantageous to the country than the greater
part of other employments, absorb a much greater proportion of the
capital of the country than what would otherwise have gone to it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_355">The mercantile stock of every country, it has been shewn in the<span class="type-margin"><span>The stock of a country naturally seeks the employment most advantageous to the country.</span></span> second book,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt227" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt227_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 naturally seeks, if one may say so, the employment most advantageous to
 that country. If it is employed in the carrying trade, the country to
which it belongs becomes the emporium of the goods of all the countries
whose trade that stock carries on. But the owner of that stock
necessarily wishes to dispose of as great a part of those goods as he
can at home. He thereby saves himself the trouble, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>128<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 risk, and expence, of exportation, and he will upon that account be
glad to sell them at home, not only for a much smaller price, but with
somewhat a smaller profit than he might expect to make by sending them
abroad. He naturally, therefore, endeavours as much as he can to turn
his carrying trade into a foreign trade of consumption. If his stock
again is employed in a foreign trade of consumption, he will, for the
same reason, be glad to dispose of at home as great a part as he can of
the home goods, which he collects in order to export to some foreign
market, and he will thus endeavour, as much as he can, to turn his
foreign trade of consumption into a home trade. The<span class="type-margin"><span>preferring the near to the more distant employments,</span></span>
 mercantile stock of every country naturally courts in this manner the
near, and shuns the distant employment; naturally courts the employment
in which the returns are frequent, and shuns that in which they are
distant and slow; naturally courts the employment in which it can
maintain the greatest quantity of productive labour in the country to
which it belongs, or in which its owner resides, and shuns that in which
 it can maintain there the smallest quantity. It naturally courts the
employment which in ordinary cases is most advantageous, and shuns that
which in ordinary cases is least advantageous to that country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_356"><span class="type-margin"><span>unless profits are higher in the more distant, which indicates that the more distant employment is necessary.</span></span>But
 if in any of those distant employments, which in ordinary cases are
less advantageous to the country, the profit should happen to rise
somewhat higher than what is sufficient to balance the natural
preference which is given to nearer employments, this superiority of
profit will draw stock from those nearer employments, till the profits
of all return to their proper level. This superiority of profit,
however, is a proof that, in the actual circumstances of the society,
those distant employments are somewhat under-stocked in proportion to
other employments, and that the stock of the society is not distributed
in the properest manner among all the different employments carried on
in it. It is a proof that something is either bought cheaper or sold
dearer than it ought to be, and that some particular class of citizens
is more or less oppressed either by paying more or by getting less than
what is suitable to that equality, which ought to take place, and which
naturally does take place among all the different classes of them.
Though the same capital never will maintain the same quantity of
productive labour in a distant as in a near employment, yet a distant
employment may be as necessary for the welfare of the society as a near
one; the goods which the distant employment deals in being necessary,
perhaps, for carrying on many of the nearer employments. But if the
profits of those who deal in such goods are above their proper level,
those goods will be sold dearer than they ought to be, or <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>129<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 somewhat above their natural price, and all those engaged in the nearer
 employments will be more or less oppressed by this high price. Their
interest, therefore, in this case requires that some stock should be
withdrawn from those nearer employments, and turned towards that distant
 one,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt228" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt228_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 in order to reduce its profits to their proper level, and the price of
the goods which it deals in to their natural price. In this
extraordinary case, the public interest requires that some stock should
be withdrawn from those employments which in ordinary cases are more
advantageous, and turned towards one which in ordinary cases is less
advantageous to the public: and in this extraordinary case, the natural
interests and inclinations of men coincide as exactly with the public
interest as in all other ordinary cases, and lead them to withdraw stock
 from the near, and to turn it towards the distant employment.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_357">It is thus that the private interests and passions of individuals<span class="type-margin"><span>If too much goes to any employment, profit falls in that employment and the proper distribution is soon restored.</span></span>
 naturally dispose them to turn their stock towards the employments
which in ordinary cases are most advantageous to the society. But if
from this natural preference they should turn too much of it towards
those employments, the fall of profit in them and the rise of it in all
others immediately dispose them to alter this faulty distribution.
Without any intervention of law, therefore, the private interests and
passions of men naturally lead them to divide and distribute the stock
of every society, among all the different employments carried on in it,
as nearly as possible in the proportion which is most agreeable to the
interest of the whole society.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_358">All the different regulations of the mercantile system, necessarily<span class="type-margin"><span>The mercantile system disturbs this distribution, especially in regard to American and Indian trade.</span></span>
 derange more or less this natural and most advantageous distribution of
 stock. But those which concern the trade to America and the East Indies
 derange it perhaps more than any other; because the trade to those two
great continents absorbs a greater quantity of stock than any two other
branches of trade. The regulations, however, by which this derangement
is effected in those two different branches of trade are not altogether
the same. Monopoly is the great engine of both; but it is a different
sort of monopoly. Monopoly of one kind or another, indeed, seems to be
the sole engine of the mercantile system.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_359">In the trade to America every nation endeavours to engross as much<span class="type-margin"><span>The
 Portuguese attempted at first to exclude all other nations from trading
 in the Indian Seas, and the Dutch still exclude all other nations from
trade with the Spice Islands.</span></span> as possible the whole market
 of its own colonies, by fairly excluding all other nations from any
direct trade to them. During the greater part of the sixteenth century,
the Portugueze endeavoured to manage the trade to the East Indies in the
 same manner, by claiming the sole right of sailing in the Indian seas,
on account of the merit of having <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>130<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 first found out the road to them. The Dutch still continue to exclude
all other European nations from any direct trade to their spice islands.
 Monopolies of this kind are evidently established against all other
European nations, who are thereby not only excluded from a trade to
which it might be convenient for them to turn some part of their stock,
but are obliged to buy the goods which that trade deals in somewhat
dearer, than if they could import them themselves directly from the
countries which produce them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_360"><span class="type-margin"><span>Now the principal ports are open, but each country has established an exclusive company.</span></span>But
 since the fall of the power of Portugal, no European nation has claimed
 the exclusive right of sailing in the Indian seas, of which the
principal ports are now open to the ships of all European nations.
Except in Portugal,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt229" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt229_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> however, and within these few years in France,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt230" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt230_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 the trade to the East Indies has in every European country been
subjected to an exclusive company. Monopolies of this kind are properly
established against the very nation which erects them. The greater part
of that nation are thereby not only excluded from a trade to which it
might be convenient for them to turn some part of their stock, but are
obliged to buy the goods which that trade deals in, somewhat dearer than
 if it was open and free to all their countrymen. Since the
establishment of the English East India company, for example, the other
inhabitants of England, over and above being excluded from the trade,
must have paid in the price of the East India goods which they have
consumed, not only for all the extraordinary profits which the company
may have made upon those goods in consequence of their monopoly, but for
 all the extraordinary waste which the fraud and abuse, inseparable from
 the management of the affairs of so great a company, must necessarily
have occasioned. The absurdity of this second kind of monopoly,
therefore, is much more manifest than that of the first.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_361">Both these kinds of monopolies derange more or
 less the natural distribution of the stock of the society: but they do
not always derange it in the same way.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_362"><span class="type-margin"><span>Monopolies of the American kind always attract, but monopolies of exclusive compantes sometimes attract, sometimes repel stock</span></span>Monopolies
 of the first kind always attract to the particular trade in which they
are established, a greater proportion of the stock of the society than
what would go to that trade of its own accord.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_363">Monopolies of the second kind may sometimes
attract stock towards the particular trade in which they are
established, and sometimes repel it from that trade according to
different circumstances. In poor countries they naturally attract
towards that trade more stock than <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>131<span class="bracket">]</span></span> would otherwise go to it. In rich countries they naturally repel from it a good deal of stock which would otherwise go to it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_364">Such poor countries as Sweden and Denmark, for example, would<span class="type-margin"><span>In poor countries they attract,</span></span>
 probably have never sent a single ship to the East Indies, had not the
trade been subjected to an exclusive company. The establishment of such a
 company necessarily encourages adventurers. Their monopoly secures them
 against all competitors in the home market, and they have the same
chance for foreign markets with the traders of other nations. Their
monopoly shows them the certainty of a great profit upon a considerable
quantity of goods, and the chance of a considerable profit upon a great
quantity. Without such extraordinary encouragement, the poor traders of
such poor countries would probably never have thought of hazarding their
 small capitals in so very distant and uncertain an adventure as the
trade to the East Indies must naturally have appeared to them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_365">Such a rich country as Holland, on the contrary, would probably, in<span class="type-margin"><span>in rich they repel</span></span>
 the case of a free trade, send many more ships to the East Indies than
it actually does. The limited stock of the Dutch East India company<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt231" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt231_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 probably repels from that trade many great mercantile capitals which
would otherwise go to it. The mercantile capital of Holland is so great
that it is, as it were, continually overflowing, sometimes into the
public funds of foreign countries, sometimes into loans to private
traders and adventurers of foreign countries, sometimes into the most
roundabout foreign trades of consumption, and sometimes into the
carrying trade. All near employments being completely filled up, all the
 capital which can be placed in them with any tolerable profit being
already placed in them, the capital of Holland necessarily flows towards
 the most distant employments. The trade to the East Indies, if it were<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt232" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt232_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 altogether free, would probably absorb the greater part of this
redundant capital. The East Indies offer a market both for the
manufactures of Europe and for the gold and silver as well as for
several other productions of America, greater and more extensive than
both Europe and America put together.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_366">Every derangement of the natural distribution of stock is necessarily<span class="type-margin"><span>Both effects are hurtful,</span></span>
 hurtful to the society in which it takes place; whether it be by
repelling from a particular trade the stock which would otherwise go to
it, or by attracting towards a particular trade that which would not
otherwise come to it. If, without any exclusive company, the trade of
Holland <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>132<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 to the East Indies would be greater than it actually is, that country
must suffer a considerable loss by part of its capital being excluded
from the employment most convenient for that part. And in the same
manner, if, without an exclusive company, the trade of Sweden and
Denmark to the East Indies would be less than it actually is, or, what
perhaps is more probable, would not exist at all, those two countries
must likewise suffer a considerable loss by part of their capital being
drawn into an employment which must be more or less unsuitable to their
present circumstances. Better for them, perhaps, in their present
circumstances, to buy East India goods of other nations, even though
they should pay somewhat dearer, than to turn so great a part of their
small capital to so very distant a trade, in which the returns are so
very slow, in which that capital can maintain so small a quantity of
productive labour at home, where productive labour is so much wanted,
where so little is done, and where so much is to do.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_367"><span class="type-margin"><span>A country which cannot trade to the East Indies without an exclusive company should not trade there</span></span>Though
 without an exclusive company, therefore, a particular country should
not be able to carry on any direct trade to the East Indies, it will not
 from thence follow that such a company ought to be established there,
but only that such a country ought not in these circumstances to trade
directly to the East Indies. That such companies are not in general
necessary for carrying on the East India trade, is sufficiently
demonstrated by the experience of the Portugueze, who enjoyed almost the
 whole of it for more than a century together without any exclusive
company.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_368"><span class="type-margin"><span>The idea that the large capital of a company is necessary is fallacious.</span></span>No
 private merchant, it has been said, could well have capital sufficient
to maintain factors and agents in the different ports of the East
Indies, in order to provide goods for the ships which he might
occasionally send thither; and yet, unless he was able to do this, the
difficulty of finding a cargo might frequently make his ships lose the
season for returning, and the expence of so long a delay would not only
eat up the whole profit of the adventure, but frequently occasion a very
 considerable loss. This argument, however, if it proved any thing at
all, would prove that no one great branch of trade could be carried on
without an exclusive company, which is contrary to the experience of all
 nations. There is no great branch of trade in which the capital of any
one private merchant is sufficient, for carrying on all the subordinate
branches which must be carried on, in order to carry on the principal
one.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt233" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt233_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 But when a nation is ripe for any great branch of trade, some merchants
 naturally turn their capitals towards the principal, and some towards
the subordinate branches of it; and <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>133<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 though all the different branches of it are in this manner carried on,
yet it very seldom happens that they are all carried on by the capital
of one private merchant. If a nation, therefore, is ripe for the East
India trade, a certain portion of its capital will naturally divide
itself among all the different branches of that trade. Some of its
merchants will find it for their interest to reside in the East Indies,
and to employ their capitals there in providing goods for the ships
which are to be sent out by other merchants who reside in Europe. The
settlements which different European nations have obtained in the East
Indies, if they were taken from the exclusive companies to which they at
 present belong, and put under the immediate protection of the
sovereign, would render this residence both safe and easy, at least to
the merchants of the particular nations to whom those settlements
belong. If at any particular time that part of the capital of any
country which of its own accord tended and inclined, if I may say so,
towards the East India trade, was not sufficient for carrying on all
those different branches of it, it would be a proof that, at that
particular time, that country was not ripe for that trade, and that it
would do better to buy for some time, even at a higher price, from other
 European nations, the East India goods it had occasion for, than to
import them itself directly from the East Indies. What it might lose by
the high price of those goods could seldom be equal to the loss which it
 would sustain by the distraction of a large portion of its capital from
 other employments more necessary, or more useful, or more suitable to
its circumstances and situation, than a direct trade to the East Indies.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_369">Though the Europeans possess many considerable settlements both<span class="type-margin"><span>There are not numerous and thriving colonies in Africa and the East Indies, as in America</span></span>
 upon the coast of Africa and in the East Indies, they have not yet
established in either of those countries such numerous and thriving
colonies as those in the islands and continent of America. Africa,
however, as well as several of the countries comprehended under the
general name of the East Indies, are inhabited by barbarous nations. But
 those nations were by no means so weak and defenceless as the miserable
 and helpless Americans; and in proportion to the natural fertility of
the countries which they inhabited, they were besides much more
populous. The most barbarous nations either of Africa or of the East
Indies were shepherds; even the Hottentots were so.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt234" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt234_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 But the natives of every part of America, except Mexico and Peru, were
only hunters; and the difference is very great between the number of
shepherds and that of hunters whom the same extent of equally fertile
territory can maintain. In Africa and the East Indies, therefore, it <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>134<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 was more difficult to displace the natives, and to extend the European
plantations over the greater part of the lands of the original
inhabitants. The genius of exclusive companies, besides, is
unfavourable, it has already been observed,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt235" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt235_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 to the growth of new colonies, and has probably been the principal
cause of the little progress which they have made in the East Indies.
The Portugueze carried on the trade both to Africa and the East Indies
without any exclusive companies, and their settlements at Congo, Angola,
 and Benguela on the coast of Africa, and at Goa in the East Indies,
though much depressed by superstition and every sort of bad government,
yet bear some faint resemblance to the colonies of America, and are
partly inhabited by Portugueze who have been established there for
several generations. The Dutch settlements at the Cape of Good Hope and
at Batavia, are at present the most considerable colonies which the
Europeans have established either in Africa or in the East Indies, and
both these<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt236" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt236_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 settlements are peculiarly fortunate in their situation. The Cape of
Good Hope was inhabited by a race of people almost as barbarous and
quite as incapable of defending themselves as the natives of America. It
 is besides the half-way house, if one may say so, between Europe and
the East Indies, at which almost every European ship makes some stay
both in going and returning. The supplying of those ships with every
sort of fresh provisions, with fruit and sometimes with wine, affords
alone a very extensive market for the surplus produce of the colonists.
What the Cape of Good Hope is between Europe and every part of the East
Indies, Batavia is between the principal countries of the East Indies.
It lies upon the most frequented road from Indostan to China and Japan,
and is nearly about mid-way upon that road. Almost all the ships too
that sail between Europe and China touch at Batavia; and it is, over and
 above all this, the center and principal mart of what is called the
country trade of the East Indies; not only of that part of it which is
carried on by Europeans, but of that which is carried on by the native
Indians; and vessels navigated by the inhabitants of China and Japan, of
 Tonquin, Malacca, Cochin-China, and the island of Celebes, are
frequently to be seen in its port. Such advantageous situations have
enabled those two colonies to surmount all the obstacles which the
oppressive genius of an exclusive company may have occasionally opposed
to their growth. They have enabled Batavia to surmount the additional
disadvantage of perhaps the most unwholesome climate in the world.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_370"><span class="type-margin"><span>The Dutch exclusive company destroys spices and nutmeg trees,</span></span>The
 English and Dutch companies, though they have established no
considerable colonies, except the two above mentioned, have both <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>135<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 made considerable conquests in the East Indies. But in the manner in
which they both govern their new subjects, the natural genius of an
exclusive company has shown itself most distinctly. In the spice islands
 the Dutch are said to<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt237" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt237_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 burn all the spiceries which a fertile season produces beyond what they
 expect to dispose of in Europe with such a profit as they think
sufficient. In the islands where they have no settlements, they give a
premium to those who collect the young blossoms and green leaves of the
clove and nutmeg trees which naturally grow there, but which this savage<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt238" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt238_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 policy has now, it is said, almost completely extirpated. Even in the
islands where they have settlements they have very much reduced, it is
said, the number of those trees. If the produce even of their own
islands was much greater than what suited their market, the natives,
they suspect, might find means to convey some part of it to other
nations; and the best way, they imagine, to secure their own monopoly,
is to take care that no more shall grow than what they themselves carry
to market. By different arts of oppression they have reduced the
population of several<span class="type-margin"><span>and has reduced the population of the Moniccas</span></span>
 of the Moluccas nearly to the number which is sufficient to supply with
 fresh provisions and other necessaries of life their own insignificant
garrisons, and such of their ships as occasionally come there for a
cargo of spices. Under the government even of the Portugueze, however,
those islands are said to have been tolerably well inhabited. The<span class="type-margin"><span>The English company has the same tendency</span></span>
 English company have not yet had time to establish in Bengal so
perfectly destructive a system. The plan of their government, however,
has had exactly the same tendency. It has not been uncommon, I am well
assured, for the chief, that is, the first clerk of a factory, to order a
 peasant to plough up a rich field of poppies, and sow it with rice or
some other grain. The pretence was, to prevent a scarcity of provisions;
 but the real reason, to give the chief an opportunity of selling at a
better price a large quantity of opium, which he happened then to have
upon hand. Upon other occasions the order has been reversed; and a rich
field of rice or other grain has been ploughed up, in order to make room
 for a plantation of poppies; when the chief foresaw that extraordinary
profit was likely to be made by opium. The servants of the company have
upon several occasions attempted to establish in their own favour the
monopoly of some of the most important branches, not only of the
foreign, but of the inland trade of the country. Had they been allowed
to go on, it is impossible that they should not at some time or another
have attempted to restrain the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>136<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 production of the particular articles of which they had thus usurped
the monopoly, not only to the quantity which they themselves could
purchase, but to that which they could expect to sell with such a profit
 as they might think sufficient. In the course of a century or two, the
policy of the English company would in this manner have probably proved
as completely destructive as that of the Dutch.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_371"><span class="type-margin"><span>This destructive system is contrary to their interest as sovereigns,</span></span>Nothing,
 however, can be more directly contrary to the real interest of those
companies, considered as the sovereigns of the countries which they have
 conquered, than this destructive plan. In almost all countries the
revenue of the sovereign is drawn from that of the people. The greater
the revenue of the people, therefore, the greater the annual produce of
their land and labour, the more they can afford to the sovereign. It is
his interest, therefore, to increase as much as possible that annual
produce. But if this is the interest of every sovereign, it is
peculiarly so of one whose revenue, like that of the sovereign of
Bengal, arises chiefly from a land-rent. That rent must necessarily be
in proportion to the quantity and value of the produce, and both the one
 and the other must depend upon the extent of the market. The quantity
will always be suited with more or less exactness to the consumption of
those who can afford to pay for it, and the price which they will pay
will always be in proportion to the eagerness of their competition. It
is the interest of such a sovereign, therefore, to open the most
extensive market for the produce of his country, to allow the most
perfect freedom of commerce, in order to increase as much as possible
the number and the competition of buyers; and upon this account to
abolish, not only all monopolies, but all restraints upon the
transportation of the home produce from one part of the country to
another, upon its exportation to foreign countries, or upon the
importation of goods of any kind for which it can be exchanged. He is in
 this manner most likely to increase both the quantity and value of that
 produce, and consequently of his own share of it, or of his own
revenue.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_372"><span class="type-margin"><span>but they prefer the transitory profits of the monopolist merchant to the permanent revenue of the sovereign</span></span>But
 a company of merchants are, it seems, incapable of considering
themselves as sovereigns, even after they have become such. Trade, or
buying in order to sell again, they still consider as their<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt239" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt239_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 principal business, and by a strange absurdity, regard the character of
 the sovereign as but an appendix to that of the merchant, as something
which ought to be made subservient to it, or by means of which they may
be enabled to buy cheaper in India, and thereby to sell with a better
profit in Europe. They endeavour for this purpose to keep out <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>137<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 as much as possible all competitors from the market of the countries
which are subject to their government, and consequently to reduce, at
least, some part of the surplus produce of those countries to what is
barely sufficient for supplying their own demand, or to what they can
expect to sell in Europe with such a profit as they may think
reasonable. Their mercantile habits draw them in this manner, almost
necessarily, though perhaps insensibly, to prefer upon all ordinary
occasions the little and transitory profit of the monopolist to the
great and permanent revenue of the sovereign, and would gradually lead
them to treat the countries subject to their government nearly as the
Dutch treat the Moluccas. It is the interest of the East India company
considered as sovereigns, that the European goods which are carried to
their Indian dominions, should be sold there as cheap as possible; and
that the Indian goods which are brought from thence should bring there
as good a price, or should be sold there as dear as possible. But the
reverse of this is their interest as merchants. As sovereigns, their
interest is exactly the same with that of the country which they govern.
 As merchants, their interest is directly opposite to that interest.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt240" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt240_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_373">But if the genius of such a government, even as to what concerns<span class="type-margin"><span>The administration in India thinks only of buying cheap and selling dear</span></span>
 its direction in Europe, is in this manner essentially and perhaps
incurably faulty, that of its administration in India is still more so.
That administration is necessarily composed of a council of merchants, a
 profession no doubt extremely respectable, but which in no country in
the world carries along with it that sort of authority which naturally
over-awes the people, and without force commands their willing
obedience. Such a council can command obedience only by the military
force with which they are accompanied, and their government is therefore
 necessarily military and despotical. Their proper business, however, is
 that of merchants. It is to sell, upon their masters account, the
European goods consigned to them, and to buy in return Indian goods for
the European market. It is to sell the one as dear and to buy the other
as cheap as possible, and consequently to exclude as much as possible
all rivals from the particular market where they keep their shop. The
genius of the administration, therefore, so far as concerns the trade of
 the company, is the same as that of the direction. It tends to make
government subservient to the interest of monopoly, and consequently to
stunt the natural growth of some parts at least of the surplus produce
of the country to what is barely sufficient for answering the demand of
the company.</p>

 the members of the administration, besides, trade more or less upon
their own account, and it is in vain to prohibit them from doing so.
Nothing can be more completely foolish than to expect that the clerks of
 a great counting-house at ten thousand miles distance, and consequently
 almost quite out of sight, should, upon a simple order from their
masters, give up at once doing any sort of business upon their own
account, abandon for ever all hopes of making a fortune, of which they
have the means in their hands, and content themselves with the moderate
salaries which those masters allow them, and which, moderate as they
are, can seldom be augmented, being commonly as large as the real
profits of the company trade can afford. In such circumstances, to
prohibit the servants of the company from trading upon their own
account, can have scarce any other effect than to enable the superior
servants, under pretence of executing their masters order, to oppress
such of the inferior ones as have had the misfortune to fall under their
 displeasure. The servants naturally endeavour to establish the same
monopoly in favour of their own private trade as of the public trade of
the company. If they are suffered to act as they could wish, they will
establish this monopoly openly and directly, by fairly prohibiting all
other people from trading in the articles in which they chuse to deal;
and this, perhaps, is the best and least oppressive way of establishing
it. But if by an order from Europe they are prohibited from doing this,
they will, notwithstanding, endeavour to establish a monopoly of the
same kind, secretly and indirectly, in a way that is much more
destructive to the country. They will employ the whole authority of
government, and pervert the administration of justice, in order to
harass and ruin those who interfere with them in any branch of commerce
which, by means of agents, either concealed, or at least not publicly
avowed, they may chuse to carry on. But the<span class="type-margin"><span>and this private trade is more extensive and harmful than the public trade of the company.</span></span>
 private trade of the servants will naturally extend to a much greater
variety of articles than the public trade of the company. The public
trade of the company extends no further than the trade with Europe, and
comprehends a part only of the foreign trade of the country. But the
private trade of the servants may extend to all the different branches
both of its inland and foreign trade. The monopoly of the company can
tend only to stunt the natural growth of that part of the surplus
produce which, in the case of a free trade, would be exported to Europe.
 That of the servants tends to stunt the natural growth of every part of
 the produce in which they chuse to deal, of what is destined for home
consumption, as well as of what is destined for exportation; and
consequently to degrade the cultivation of the whole <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>139<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 country, and to reduce the number of its inhabitants. It tends to
reduce the quantity of every sort of produce, even that of the
necessaries of life, whenever the servants of the company chuse to deal
in them, to what those servants can both afford to buy and expect to
sell with such a profit as pleases them.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt241" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt241_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_375">From the nature of their situation too the servants must be more<span class="type-margin"><span>The interest of the servants is not, like the real interest of the company, the same as that of the country</span></span>
 disposed to support with rigorous severity their own interest against
that of the country which they govern, than their masters can be to
support theirs. The country belongs to their masters, who cannot avoid
having some regard for the interest of what belongs to them. But it does
 not belong to the servants. The real interest of their masters, if they
 were capable of understanding it, is the same with that of the country,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt242" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt242_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> and it is from ignorance chiefly,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt243" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt243_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 and the meanness of mercantile prejudice, that they ever oppress it.
But the real interest of the servants is by no means the same with that
of the country, and the most perfect information would not necessarily
put an end to their oppressions. The regulations accordingly which have
been sent out from Europe, though they have been frequently weak, have
upon most occasions been well-meaning.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt244" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt244_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> More intelligence and perhaps less good-meaning has sometimes appeared in those established by the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>140<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 servants in India. It is a very singular government in which every
member of the administration wishes to get out of the country, and
consequently to have done with the government, as soon as he can, and to
 whose interest, the day after he has left it and carried his whole
fortune with him, it is perfectly indifferent though<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt245" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt245_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> the whole country was swallowed up by an earthquake.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_376"><span class="type-margin"><span>The evils come from the system, not from the character of the men who administer it</span></span>I
 mean not, however, by any thing which I have here said, to throw any
odious imputation upon the general character of the servants of the East
 India company, and much less upon that of any particular persons. It is
 the system of government, the situation in which they are<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt246" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt246_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 placed, that I mean to censure; not the character of those who have
acted in it. They acted as their situation naturally directed, and they
who have clamoured the loudest against them would, probably, not have
acted better themselves. In war and negociation, the councils of Madras
and Calcutta have upon several occasions conducted themselves with a
resolution and decisive wisdom which would have done honour to the
senate of Rome in the best days of that republic. The members of those
councils, however, had been bred to professions very different from war
and politics. But their situation alone, without education, experience,
or even example, seems to have formed in them all at once the great
qualities which it required, and to have inspired them both with
abilities and virtues which they themselves could not well know that
they possessed. If upon some occasions, therefore, it has animated them
to actions of magnanimity which could not well have been expected from
them, we should not wonder if upon others it has prompted them to
exploits of somewhat a different nature.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_377"><span class="type-margin"><span>Exclusive companies are nuisances.</span></span>Such
 exclusive companies, therefore, are nuisances in every respect; always
more or less inconvenient to the countries in which they are

<h2 id="lf0206-02_label_295">CHAPTER VIII: CONCLUSION OF THE MERCANTILE SYSTEM<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt247" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt247_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-02_378">THOUGH the encouragement of exportation, and the discouragement<span class="type-margin"><span>The mercantile system discourages the exportation of materials of manufacture and instruments of trade</span></span>
 of importation, are the two great engines by which the mercantile
system proposes to enrich every country, yet with regard to some
particular commodities, it seems to follow an opposite plan: to
discourage exportation and to encourage importation. Its ultimate
object, however, it pretends, is always the same, to enrich the country
by an advantageous balance of trade. It discourages the exportation of
the materials of manufacture, and of the instruments of trade, in order
to give our own workmen an advantage, and to enable them to undersell
those of other nations in all foreign markets: and by restraining, in
this manner, the exportation of a few commodities, of no great price, it
 proposes to occasion a much greater and more valuable exportation of
others. It encourages the importation of the materials<span class="type-margin"><span>It encourages the importation of materials though not of instruments of trade.</span></span>
 of manufacture, in order that our own people may be enabled to work
them up more cheaply, and thereby prevent a greater and more valuable
importation of the manufactured commodities. I do not observe, at least
in our Statute Book, any encouragement given to the importation of the
instruments of trade. When manufactures have advanced to a certain pitch
 of greatness, the fabrication of the instruments of trade becomes
itself the object of a great number of very important manufactures. To
give any particular encouragement to the importation of such
instruments, would interfere too much with the interest of those
manufactures. Such importation, therefore, instead of being encouraged,
has frequently been prohibited. Thus the importation of wool cards,
except from Ireland, or when brought in as wreck or prize goods, was
prohibited by the 3d of Edward IV.;<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt248" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt248_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> which prohibition was renewed by the 39th of Elizabeth,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt249" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt249_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> and has been continued and rendered perpetual by subsequent laws.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt250" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt250_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>142<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_379">The importation of the materials of
manufacture has sometimes been encouraged by an exemption from the
duties to which other goods are subject, and sometimes by bounties.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_380"><span class="type-margin"><span>Various materials are exempt from customs duties.</span></span>The importation of sheep’s wool from several different countries,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt251" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt251_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> of cotton wool from all countries,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt252" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt252_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> of undressed flax,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt253" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt253_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> of the greater part of dying drugs,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt254" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt254_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> of the greater part of undressed hides from Ireland or the British colonies,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt255" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt255_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a> of seal skins from the British Greenland fishery,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt256" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt256_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">6</a> of pig and bar iron from the British colonies,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt257" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt257_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">7</a>
 as well as of several other materials of manufacture, has been
encouraged by an exemption from all duties, if properly entered at the
customhouse. The private interest of our merchants and manufacturers
may, perhaps, have extorted from the legislature these exemptions, as
well as the greater part of our other commercial regulations. They are,
however, perfectly just and reasonable, and if, consistently with the
necessities of the state, they could be extended to all the other
materials of manufacture, the public would certainly be a gainer.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_381"><span class="type-margin"><span>Yarn, though a manufactured article is free from duty,</span></span>The
 avidity of our great manufacturers, however, has in some cases extended
 these exemptions a good deal beyond what can justly be considered as
the rude materials of their work. By the 24 Geo. II. chap. 46. a small
duty of only one penny the pound was imposed upon the importation of
foreign brown linen yarn, instead of much higher duties to which it had
been subjected before, viz. of sixpence the pound upon sail yarn, of one
 shilling the pound upon all French and Dutch yarn, and of two pounds
thirteen shillings and fourpence upon the hundred weight of all spruce
or Muscovia yarn.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt258" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt258_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">8</a>
 But our manufacturers were not long satisfied with this reduction. By
the 29th of the same king, chap. 15, the same law which gave a bounty
upon the exportation of British and Irish linen of which the price did
not exceed eighteen pence the yard, even this small duty upon the
importation of brown linen yarn was taken away. In the different
operations, however, which are necessary for the preparation of linen
yarn, a good deal more industry is employed, than in the subsequent
operation of preparing linen cloth from linen yarn. To say nothing of
the industry of the flax-growers and flax-dressers, three or four
spinners, at least, are <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>143<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 necessary, in order to keep one weaver in constant employment; and more
 than four-fifths of the whole quantity of labour, necessary for the
preparation of linen cloth, is employed in that of linen yarn; but our<span class="type-margin"><span>because the spinners are poor, unprotected people, and the master weavers are rich and powerful</span></span>
 spinners are poor people, women commonly, scattered about in all
different parts of the country, without support or protection. It is not
 by the sale of their work, but by that of the complete work of the
weavers, that our great master manufacturers make their profits. As it
is their interest to sell the complete manufacture as dear, so is it to
buy the materials as cheap as possible. By extorting from the
legislature bounties upon the exportation of their own linen, high
duties upon the importation of all foreign linen, and a total
prohibition of the home consumption of some sorts of French linen,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt259" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt259_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 they endeavour to sell their own goods as dear as possible. By
encouraging the importation of foreign linen yarn, and thereby bringing
it into competition with that which is made by our own people, they
endeavour to buy the work of the poor spinners as cheap as possible.
They are as intent to keep down the wages of their own weavers, as the
earnings of the poor spinners, and it is by no means for the benefit of
the workman, that they endeavour either to raise the price of the
complete work, or to lower that of the rude materials. It is the
industry which is carried on for the benefit of the rich and the
powerful, that is principally encouraged by our mercantile system. That
which is carried on for the benefit of the poor and the indigent, is too
 often, either neglected, or oppressed.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_382">Both the bounty upon the exportation of linen, and the exemption<span class="type-margin"><span>This exemption and also the bounty on the exportation of linen are given by a temporary law</span></span>
 from duty upon the importation of foreign yarn, which were granted only
 for fifteen years, but continued by two different prolongations,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt260" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt260_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> expire with the end of the session of parliament which shall immediately follow the 24th of June 1786.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_383">The encouragement given to the importation of the materials of<span class="type-margin"><span>Bounties on imported materials have been chiefly given to American produce, such as naval stores,</span></span> manufacture by bounties, has been principally confined to such as were imported from our American plantations.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_384">The first bounties of this kind were those
granted, about the beginning of the present century, upon the
importation of naval stores from America.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt261" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt261_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 Under this denomination were comprehended timber fit for masts, yards,
and bowsprits; hemp; tar, pitch, and turpentine. The bounty, however, of
 one pound the ton upon masting-timber, and that of six pounds the ton
upon hemp, were extended to such as should <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>144<span class="bracket">]</span></span> be imported into England from Scotland.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt262" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt262_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Both these bounties continued without any variation, at the same rate,
till they were severally allowed to expire; that upon hemp on the 1st of
 January 1741, and that upon masting-timber at the end of the session of
 parliament immediately following the 24th June 1781.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_385">The bounties upon the importation of tar,
pitch, and turpentine underwent, during their continuance, several
alterations. Originally that upon tar was four pounds the ton; that upon
 pitch the same; and that upon turpentine, three pounds the ton. The
bounty of four pounds the ton upon tar was afterwards confined to such
as had been prepared in a particular manner; that upon other good,
clean, and merchantable tar was reduced to two pounds four shillings the
 ton. The bounty upon pitch was likewise reduced to one pound; and that
upon turpentine to one pound ten shillings the ton.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt263" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt263_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_386"><span class="type-margin"><span>colonial indigo,</span></span>The
 second bounty upon the importation of any of the materials of
manufacture, according to the order of time, was that granted by the 21
Geo. II. chap. 30. upon the importation of indigo from the British
plantations. When the plantation indigo was worth three-fourths of the
price of the best French indigo, it was by this act entitled to a bounty
 of sixpence the pound. This bounty, which, like most others, was
granted only for a limited time, was continued by several prolongations,
 but was reduced to four pence the pound.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt264" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt264_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> It was allowed to expire with the end of the session of parliament which followed the 25th March 1781.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_387"><span class="type-margin"><span>colonial hemp or undressed flax,</span></span>The
 third bounty of this kind was that granted (much about the time that we
 were beginning sometimes to court and sometimes to quarrel with our
American colonies) by the 4 Geo. III. chap. 26. upon the importation of
hemp, or undressed flax, from the British plantations. This bounty was
granted for twenty-one years, from the 24th June 1764, to the 24th June
1785. For the first seven years it was to be at the rate of eight pounds
 the ton, for the second at six pounds, and for the third at four
pounds. It was not extended to Scotland, of which the climate (although
hemp is sometimes raised there, in small quantities and of an inferior
quality) is not very fit for that produce. Such a bounty upon the
importation of Scotch flax into England would have been too great a
discouragement to the native produce of the southern part of the united
kingdom.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>145<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_388">The fourth bounty of this kind, was that granted by the 5 Geo. III.<span class="type-margin"><span>American wood,</span></span>
 chap. 45. upon the importation of wood from America. It was granted for
 nine years, from the 1st January 1766, to the 1st January 1775. During
the first three years, it was to be for every hundred and twenty good
deals, at the rate of one pound; and for every load containing fifty
cubic feet of other squared timber at the rate of twelve shillings. For
the second three years, it was for deals to be at the rate of fifteen
shillings, and for other squared timber, at the rate of eight shillings;
 and for the third three years, it was for deals, to be at the rate of
ten shillings, and for other squared timber, at the rate of five
shillings.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_389">The fifth bounty of this kind, was that granted by the 9 Geo. III.<span class="type-margin"><span>colonial raw silk,</span></span>
 chap. 38. upon the importation of raw silk from the British
plantations. It was granted for twenty-one years, from the 1st January
1770, to the 1st January 1791. For the first seven years it was to be at
 the rate of twenty-five pounds for every hundred pounds value; for the
second, at twenty pounds; and for the third at fifteen pounds. The
management of the silk-worm, and the preparation of silk, requires so
much hand labour; and labour is so very dear in America, that even this
great bounty, I have been informed, was not likely to produce any
considerable effect.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_390">The sixth bounty of this kind, was that granted by 11 Geo. III.<span class="type-margin"><span>colonial barrel staves,</span></span>
 chap. 50. for the importation of pipe, hogshead, and barrel staves and
heading from the British plantations. It was granted for nine years,
from 1st January 1772, to the 1st January 1781. For the first three
years, it was for a certain quantity of each, to be at the rate of six
pounds; for the second three years, at four pounds; and for the third
three years, at two pounds.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_391">The seventh and last bounty of this kind, was that<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt265" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt265_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> granted by the<span class="type-margin"><span>Irish hemp</span></span>
 19 Geo. III. chap. 37. upon the importation of hemp from Ireland. It
was granted in the same manner as that for the importation of hemp and
undressed flax from America,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt266" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt266_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 for twenty-one years, from the 24th June 1779, to the 24th June 1800.
This term is divided, likewise, into three periods of seven years each;
and in each of those periods, the rate of the Irish bounty is the same
with that of the American. It does not, however, like the American
bounty, extend to the importation of undressed flax. It would have been
too great a discouragement to the cultivation of that plant in Great
Britain. When this last bounty was granted, the British and Irish
legislatures were not in much better humour with one another, than the
British and American had been before. But this boon to Ireland, it is to
 be <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>146<span class="bracket">]</span></span> hoped, has been granted under more fortunate auspices, than all those to America.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_392"><span class="type-margin"><span>These
commodities were subject to duties when coming from foreign countries.
It was alleged that the interest of the colonies and of the mother
country was the same.</span></span>The same commodities upon which we
thus gave bounties, when imported from America, were subjected to
considerable duties when imported from any other country. The interest
of our American colonies was regarded as the same with that of the
mother country. Their wealth was considered as our wealth. Whatever
money was sent out to them, it was said, came all back to us by the
balance of trade, and we could never become a farthing the poorer, by
any expence which we could lay out upon them. They were our own in every
 respect, and it was an expence laid out upon the improvement of our own
 property, and for the profitable employment of our own people. It is
unnecessary, I apprehend, at present to say any thing further, in order
to expose the folly of a system, which fatal experience has now
sufficiently exposed. Had our American colonies really been a part of
Great Britain, those bounties might have been considered as bounties
upon production, and would still have been liable to all the objections
to which such bounties are liable, but to no other.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_393">The exportation of the materials of manufacture is sometimes discouraged by absolute prohibitions, and sometimes by high duties.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_394"><span class="type-margin"><span>The exportation of wool and live sheep is forbidden under heavy penalties,</span></span>Our
 woollen manufacturers have been more successful than any other class of
 workmen, in persuading the legislature that the prosperity of the
nation depended upon the success and extension of their particular
business. They have not only obtained a monopoly against the consumers
by an absolute prohibition of importing woollen cloths from any foreign
country; but they have likewise obtained another monopoly against the
sheep farmers and growers of wool, by a similar prohibition of the
exportation of live sheep and wool. The severity of many of the laws
which have been enacted for the security of the revenue is very justly
complained of, as imposing heavy penalties upon actions which,
antecedent to the statutes that declared them to be crimes, had always
been understood to be innocent. But the cruellest of our revenue laws, I
 will venture to affirm, are mild and gentle, in comparison of some of
those which the clamour of our merchants and manufacturers has extorted
from the legislature, for the support of their own absurd and oppressive
 monopolies. Like the laws of Draco, these laws may be said to be all
written in blood.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_395"><span class="type-margin"><span>at one time mutilation and death,</span></span>By
 the 8th of Elizabeth, chap. 3. the exporter of sheep, lambs or rams,
was for the first offence to forfeit all his goods for ever, to suffer a
 year’s imprisonment, and then to have his left hand cut off in a market
 town upon a market day, to be there nailed up; and for the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>147<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 second offence to be adjudged a felon, and to suffer death accordingly.
 To prevent the breed of our sheep from being propagated in foreign
countries, seems to have been the object of this law. By the 13th and
14th of Charles II. chap. 18. the exportation of wool was made felony,
and the exporter subjected to the same penalties and forfeitures as a
felon.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_396">For the honour of the national humanity, it is to be hoped that<span class="type-margin"><span>but now twenty shillings for every sheep with forfeiture of the sheep and the owner’s share in the ship,</span></span>
 neither of these statutes were ever executed. The first of them,
however, so far as I know, has never been directly repealed, and
Serjeant Hawkins seems to consider it as still in force.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt267" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt267_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 It may however, perhaps, be considered as virtually repealed by the
12th of Charles II. chap. 32. sect. 3. which, without expressly taking
away the penalties imposed by former statutes,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt268" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt268_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 imposes a new penalty, viz. That of twenty shillings for every sheep
exported, or attempted to be exported, together with the forfeiture of
the sheep and of the owner’s share of the ship. The second of them was
expressly repealed by the 7th and 8th of William III. chap. 28. sect. 4.
 By which it is declared that, “Whereas the statute of the 13th and 14th
 of King Charles II. made against the exportation of wool, among other
things in the said act mentioned, doth enact the same to be deemed
felony; by the severity of which penalty the prosecution of offenders
hath not been so effectually put in execution: Be it, therefore, enacted
 by the authority foresaid, that so much of the said act, which relates
to the making the said offence felony, be repealed and made void.”</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_397">The penalties, however, which are either imposed by this milder<span class="type-margin"><span>and three shillings for every pound of wool, with other pains and penalties.</span></span>
 statute, or which, though imposed by former statutes, are not repealed
by this one, are still sufficiently severe. Besides the forfeiture of
the goods, the exporter incurs the penalty of three shillings for every
pound weight of wool either exported or attempted to be exported, that
is about four or five times the value. Any merchant or other person
convicted of this offence is disabled from requiring any debt or account

 order to prevent exportation, the whole inland commerce of wool is laid
 under very burdensome and oppressive restrictions. It cannot be packed

 packs of leather or pack-cloth, on which must be marked on the outside
the words <span class="ital">wool</span> or <span class="ital">yarn,</span>
 in large letters not less than three inches long, on pain of forfeiting
 the same and the package, and three shillings for every pound weight,
to be paid by the owner or packer.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt272" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt272_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>

 The hundred next adjoining to the sea coast, out of or through which
the wool is carried or exported, forfeits twenty pounds, if the wool is
under the value of ten pounds; and if of greater value, then treble that
 value, together with treble costs, to be sued for within the year. The
execution to be against any two of the inhabitants, whom the sessions
must reimburse, by an assessment on the other inhabitants, as in the
cases of robbery. And if any person compounds with the hundred for less
than this penalty, he is to be imprisoned for five years; and any other
person may prosecute. These regulations take place through the whole
kingdom.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt274" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt274_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_399"><span class="type-margin"><span>especially in Kent and Sussex,</span></span>But
 in the particular counties of Kent and Sussex the restrictions are
still more troublesome. Every owner of wool within ten miles of the
sea-coast must give an account in writing, three days after shearing, to
 the next officer of the customs, of the number of his fleeces, and of
the places where they are lodged. And before he removes any part of them
 he must give the like notice of the number and weight of the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>149<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 fleeces, and of the name and abode of the person to whom they are sold,
 and of the place to which it is intended they should be carried. No
person within fifteen miles of the sea, in the said counties, can buy
any wool, before he enters into bond to the king, that no part of the
wool which he shall so buy shall be sold by him to any other person
within fifteen miles of the sea. If any wool is found carrying towards
the sea-side in the said counties, unless it has been entered and
security given as aforesaid, it is forfeited, and the offender also
forfeits three shillings for every pound weight. If any person lays any
wool, not entered as aforesaid, within fifteen miles of the sea, it must
 be seized and forfeited; and if, after such seizure, any person shall
claim the same, he must give security to the Exchequer, that if he is
cast upon trial he shall pay treble costs, besides all other penalties.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt275" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt275_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_400">When such restrictions are imposed upon the inland trade, the<span class="type-margin"><span>and so also is the coasting trade.</span></span>
 coasting trade, we may believe, cannot be left very free. Every owner
of wool who carrieth or causeth to be carried any wool to any port or
place on the sea-coast, in order to be from thence transported by sea to
 any other place or port on the coast, must first cause an entry thereof
 to be made at the port from whence it is intended to be conveyed,
containing the weight, marks, and number of the packages before he
brings the same within five miles of that port; on pain of forfeiting
the same, and also the horses, carts, and other carriages; and also of
suffering and forfeiting, as by the other laws in force against the
exportation of wool. This law, however, (1 Will. III. chap. 32.) is so
very indulgent as to declare, that “this shall not hinder any person
from carrying his wool home from the place of shearing, though it be
within five miles of the sea, provided that in ten days after shearing,
and before he remove the wool, he do under his hand certify to the next
officer of the customs, the true number of fleeces, and where it is
housed; and do not remove the same, without certifying to such officer,
under his hand, his intention so to do, three days before.”<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt276" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt276_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 Bond must be given that the wool to be carried coastways is to be
landed at the particular port for which it is entered outwards; and if
any part of it is landed without the presence of an officer, not only
the forfeiture of the wool is incurred as in other goods, but the usual
additional penalty of three shillings for every pound weight is likewise
 incurred.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_401">Our woollen manufacturers, in order to justify their demand of such<span class="type-margin"><span>The manufacturers alleged that English wool was superior to all others, which is entirely false.</span></span>
 extraordinary restrictions and regulations, confidently asserted, that
English wool was of a peculiar quality, superior to that of any other <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>150<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 country; that the wool of other countries could not, without some
mixture of it, be wrought up into any tolerable manufacture; that fine
cloth could not be made without it; that England, therefore, if the
exportation of it could be totally prevented, could monopolize to
herself almost the whole woollen trade of the world; and thus, having no
 rivals, could sell at what price she pleased, and in a short time
acquire the most incredible degree of wealth by the most advantageous
balance of trade. This doctrine, like most other doctrines which are
confidently asserted by any considerable number of people, was, and
still continues to be, most implicitly believed by a much greater
number; by almost all those who are either unacquainted with the woollen
 trade, or who have not made particular enquiries. It is, however, so
perfectly false, that English wool is in any respect necessary for the
making of fine cloth, that it is altogether unfit for it. Fine cloth is
made altogether of Spanish wool. English wool cannot be even so mixed
with Spanish wool as to enter into the composition without spoiling and
degrading, in some degree, the fabric of the cloth.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt277" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt277_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_402"><span class="type-margin"><span>These regulations have depressed the price of wool, as was desired,</span></span>It has been shown in the foregoing part of this work,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt278" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt278_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 that the effect of these regulations has been to depress the price of
English wool, not only below what it naturally would be in the present
times, but very much below what it actually was in the time of Edward
III. The price of Scots wool, when in consequence of the union it became
 subject to the same regulations, is said to have fallen about one half.
 It is observed by the very accurate and intelligent author of the
Memoirs of Wool, the Reverend Mr. John Smith, that the price of the best
 English wool in England is generally below what wool of a very inferior
 quality commonly sells for in the market of Amsterdam.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt279" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt279_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 To depress the price of this commodity below what may be called its
natural and proper price, was the avowed purpose of those regulations;
and there seems to be no doubt of their having produced the effect that
was expected from them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_403"><span class="type-margin"><span>but this has not much reduced the quantity of wool grown,</span></span>This
 reduction of price, it may perhaps be thought, by discouraging the
growing of wool, must have reduced very much the annual produce of that
commodity, though not below what it formerly was, yet below what, in the
 present state of things, it probably would have been, had it, in
consequence of an open and free market, been allowed to rise to the
natural and proper price. I am, however, disposed to believe, that the
quantity of the annual produce cannot have been much, though it may
perhaps have been a little, affected by these regulations. The <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>151<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 growing of wool is not the chief purpose for which the sheep farmer
employs his industry and stock. He expects his profit, not so much from
the price of the fleece, as from that of the carcase; and the average or
 ordinary price of the latter, must even, in many cases, make up to him
whatever deficiency there may be in the average or ordinary price of the
 former. It has been observed in the foregoing part of this work, that
“Whatever regulations tend to sink the price, either of wool or of raw
hides, below what it naturally would be, must, in an improved and
cultivated country, have some tendency to raise the price of butchers
meat. The price both of the great and small cattle which are fed on
improved and cultivated land, must be sufficient to pay the rent which
the landlord, and the profit which the farmer has reason to expect from
improved and cultivated land. If it is not, they will soon cease to feed
 them. Whatever part of this price, therefore, is not paid by the wool
and the hide, must be paid by the carcase. The less there is paid for
the one, the more must be paid for the other. In what manner this price
is to be divided upon the different parts of the beast, is indifferent
to the landlords and farmers, provided it is all paid to them. In an
improved and cultivated country, therefore, their interest as landlords
and farmers cannot be much affected by such regulations, though their
interest as consumers may, by the rise in the price of provisions.”<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt280" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt280_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 According to this reasoning, therefore, this degradation in the price
of wool is not likely, in an improved and cultivated country, to
occasion any diminution in the annual produce of that commodity; except
so far as, by raising the price of mutton, it may somewhat diminish the
demand for, and consequently the production of, that particular species
of butchers meat. Its effect, however, even in this way, it is probable,
 is not very considerable.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_404">But though its effect upon the quantity of the annual produce may<span class="type-margin"><span>nor its quality,</span></span>
 not have been very considerable, its effect upon the quality, it may
perhaps be thought, must necessarily have been very great. The
degradation in the quality of English wool, if not below what it was in
former times, yet below what it naturally would have been in the present
 state of improvement and cultivation, must have been, it may perhaps be
 supposed, very nearly in proportion to the degradation of price. As the
 quality depends upon the breed, upon the pasture, and upon the
management and cleanliness of the sheep, during the whole progress of
the growth of the fleece, the attention to these circumstances, it may
naturally enough be imagined, can never be greater than in proportion to
 the recompence which the price of the fleece is likely to <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>152<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 make for the labour and expence which that attention requires. It
happens, however, that the goodness of the fleece depends, in a great
measure, upon the health, growth, and bulk of the animal; the same
attention which is necessary for the improvement of the carcase, is, in
some respects, sufficient for that of the fleece. Notwithstanding the
degradation of price, English wool is said to have been improved
considerably during the course even of the present century. The
improvement might perhaps have been greater if the price had been
better; but the lowness of price, though it may have obstructed, yet
certainly it has not altogether prevented that improvement.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_405"><span class="type-margin"><span>so that the growers of wool have been less hurt than might have been expected</span></span>The
 violence of these regulations, therefore, seems to have affected
neither the quantity nor the quality of the annual produce of wool so
much as it might have been expected to do (though I think it probable
that it may have affected the latter a good deal more than the former);
and the interest of the growers of wool, though it must have been hurt
in some degree, seems, upon the whole, to have been much less hurt than
could well have been imagined.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_406"><span class="type-margin"><span>Though
prohibition of exportation cannot be justified, a duty on the
exportation of wool might furnish revenue with little inconvenience</span></span>These considerations, however, will not justify the absolute prohibition of the exportation of wool.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt281" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt281_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> But they will fully justify the imposition of a considerable tax upon that exportation.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_407">To hurt in any degree the interest of any one
order of citizens, for no other purpose but to promote that of some
other, is evidently contrary to that justice and equality of treatment
which the sovereign owes to all the different orders of his subjects.
But the prohibition certainly hurts, in some degree, the interest of the
 growers of wool, for no other purpose but to promote that of the
manufacturers.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_408">Every different order of citizens is bound to
contribute to the support of the sovereign or commonwealth. A tax of
five, or even of ten shillings upon the exportation of every tod of
wool, would produce a very considerable revenue to the sovereign. It
would hurt the interest of the growers somewhat less than the
prohibition, because it would not probably lower the price of wool quite
 so much. It would afford a sufficient advantage to the manufacturer,
because, though he might not buy his wool altogether so cheap as under
the prohibition, he would still buy it, at least, five or ten shillings
cheaper than any foreign manufacturer could buy it, besides saving the
freight and insurance, which the other would be obliged to pay. It is
scarce possible to devise a tax which could produce any considerable
revenue to the sovereign, and at the same time occasion so little
inconveniency to any body.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>153<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_409">The prohibition, notwithstanding all the
penalties which guard it, does not prevent the exportation of wool. It
is exported, it is well known, in great quantities. The great difference
 between the price in the home and that in the foreign market, presents
such a temptation to smuggling, that all the rigour of the law cannot
prevent it. This illegal exportation is advantageous to nobody but the
smuggler. A legal exportation subject to a tax, by affording a revenue
to the sovereign, and thereby saving the imposition of some other,
perhaps, more burdensome and inconvenient taxes, might prove
advantageous to all the different subjects of the state.</p>

 and the law gave a monopoly to our boot-makers and shoe-makers, not
only against our graziers, but against our tanners. By subsequent
statutes, our tanners have got themselves exempted from this monopoly,
upon paying a small tax of only one shilling on the hundred weight of
tanned leather, weighing one hundred and twelve pounds.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt285" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt285_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 They have obtained likewise the drawback of two-thirds of the excise
duties imposed upon their commodity, even when exported without further
manufacture. All manufactures of leather may be exported duty free; and

excise.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt286" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt286_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a>

 the exportation of all metals was prohibited. Lead and tin were alone
excepted; probably on account of the great abundance of those metals; in
 the exportation of which, a considerable part of the trade of the
kingdom in those days consisted. For the encouragement of the mining
trade, the 5th of William and Mary, chap. 17. exempted from this
prohibition, iron, copper, and mundic metal made from British ore. The
exportation of all sorts of copper bars, foreign as well as British, was

<p id="Smith_0206-02_415">By the 8th George I. chap. 15., the
exportation of all goods, the produce or manufacture of Great Britain,
upon which any duties had been imposed by former statutes, was rendered
duty free. The following goods, however, were excepted: Allum, lead,
lead ore, tin, tanned leather, copperas, coals, wool cards, white
woollen cloths, lapis calaminaris, skins of all sorts, glue, coney hair
or wool, hares wool, hair of all sorts, horses, and litharge of lead. If
 you except horses, all these are either materials of manufacture, or
incomplete manufactures (which may be considered as materials for still
further manufacture), or instruments of trade. This statute leaves them
subject to all the old duties which had ever been imposed upon them, the
 old subsidy and one per cent. outwards.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt295" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt295_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_416">By the same statute a great number of foreign
drugs for dyers use, are exempted from all duties upon importation. Each

 a very heavy one, upon exportation.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt296" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt296_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 Our dyers, it seems, while they thought it for their interest to
encourage the importation of those drugs, by an exemption from all
duties, thought it likewise for their interest to throw some small
discouragement upon their exportation. The avidity, however, which
suggested this notable piece of mercantile ingenuity, most probably
disappointed itself of its object. It necessarily taught the importers
to be more careful than they might otherwise have been, that their
importation should not exceed what was necessary for the supply of the
home market. The home market was at all times likely to be more scantily
 supplied; the commodities were at all times likely to be somewhat
dearer there than they would have been, had the exportation been
rendered as free as the importation.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_417">By the above-mentioned statute, gum senega, or gum arabic, being<span class="type-margin"><span>Gum senega has a peculiar history and is subject to a large export duty,</span></span>
 among the enumerated dying drugs, might be imported duty free. They
were subjected, indeed, to a small poundage duty, amounting only to
three pence in the hundred weight upon their re-exportation. France
enjoyed, at that time, an exclusive trade to the country most productive
 of those drugs, that which lies in the neighbourhood of the Senegal;
and the British market could not be easily supplied by the immediate
importation of them from the place of growth. By <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>156<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the 25th Geo. II.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt297" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt297_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 therefore, gum senega was allowed to be imported (contrary to the
general dispositions of the act of navigation), from any part of Europe.
 As the law, however, did not mean to encourage this species of trade,
so contrary to the general principles of the mercantile policy of
England, it imposed a duty of ten shillings the hundred weight upon such
 importation, and no part of this duty was to be afterwards drawn back
upon its exportation. The successful war which began in 1755 gave Great
Britain the same exclusive trade to those countries which France had
enjoyed before.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt298" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt298_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 Our manufacturers, as soon as the peace was made, endeavoured to avail
themselves of this advantage, and to establish a monopoly in their own
favour, both against the growers, and against the importers of this
commodity. By the 5th Geo. III. therefore, chap. 37. the exportation of
gum senega from his majesty’s dominions in Africa was confined to Great
Britain, and was subjected to all the same restrictions, regulations,
forfeitures and penalties, as that of the enumerated commodities of the
British colonies in America and the West Indies. Its importation,
indeed, was subjected to a small duty of six-pence the hundred weight,
but its re-exportation was subjected to the enormous duty of one pound
ten shillings the hundred weight. It was the intention of our
manufacturers that the whole produce of those countries should be
imported into Great Britain, and in order that they themselves might be
enabled to buy it at their own price, that no part of it should be
exported again, but at such an expence as would sufficiently discourage
that exportation. Their avidity, however, upon this, as well as upon
many other occasions, disappointed itself of its object. This enormous
duty presented such a temptation to smuggling, that great quantities of
this commodity were clandestinely exported, probably to all the
manufacturing countries of Europe, but particularly to Holland, not only
 from Great Britain but from Africa. Upon this account,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt299" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt299_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> by the 14 Geo. III. chap. 10. this duty upon exportation was reduced to five shillings the hundred weight.</p>

rate, or to sixteen-pence upon each skin;<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt300" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt300_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> all of which, except half the old subsidy, amounting only to two-pence, was drawn back <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>157<span class="bracket">]</span></span> upon exportation.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt301" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt301_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 This duty upon the importation of so important a material of
manufacture had been thought too high, and, in the year 1722, the rate
was reduced to two shillings and six-pence, which reduced the duty upon
importation to six-pence, and of this only one half was to be drawn back
 upon exportation.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt302" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt302_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 The same successful war put the country most productive of beaver under
 the dominion of Great Britain, and beaver skins being among the
enumerated commodities, their exportation from America was consequently
confined to the market of Great Britain. Our manufacturers<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt303" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt303_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> soon bethought themselves of the advantage which they might make of this circumstance, and in the year 1764,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt304" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt304_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 the duty upon the importation of beaverskin was reduced to one penny,
but the duty upon exportation was raised to seven-pence each skin,
without any drawback of the duty upon importation. By the same law, a
duty of eighteen pence the pound was imposed upon the exportation of
beaver-wool or wombs, without making any alteration in the duty upon the
 importation of that commodity, which when imported by British and in
British shipping, amounted at that time to between four-pence and
five-pence the piece.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_419">Coals may be considered both as a material of manufacture and as<span class="type-margin"><span>and coals five shillings a ton.</span></span>
 an instrument of trade. Heavy duties, accordingly, have been imposed
upon their exportation, amounting at present (1783) to more than five
shillings the ton, or to more than fifteen shillings the chaldron,
Newcastle measure; which is in most cases more than the original value
of the commodity at the coal pit, or even at the shipping port for
exportation.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_420">The exportation, however, of the instruments of trade, properly so<span class="type-margin"><span>The exportation of the instruments of trade is commonly prohibited</span></span>
 called, is commonly restrained, not by high duties, but by absolute
prohibitions. Thus by the 7th and 8th of William III. chap. 20. sect. 8.
 the exportation of frames or engines for knitting gloves or stockings
is prohibited under the penalty, not only of the forfeiture of such
frames or engines, so exported, or attempted to be exported, but of
forty pounds, one half to the king, the other to the person who shall
inform or sue for the same. In the same manner by the 14th Geo. III.
chap. 71. the exportation to foreign parts, of any utensils made use of
in the cotton, linen, woollen and silk manufactures, is prohibited under
 the penalty, not only of the forfeiture of such utensils, but of two
hundred pounds, to be paid by the person who shall offend in this
manner, and likewise of two hundred pounds to be paid by the master <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>158<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of the ship who shall knowingly suffer such utensils to be loaded on board his ship.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_421"><span class="type-margin"><span>Similarly it is a grave offence to entice an artificer abroad,</span></span>When
 such heavy penalties were imposed upon the exportation of the dead
instruments of trade, it could not well be expected that the living
instrument, the artificer, should be allowed to go free. Accordingly, by
 the 5 Geo. I. chap. 27. the person who shall be convicted of enticing
any artificer of, or in any of the manufactures of Great Britain, to go
into any foreign parts, in order to practise or teach his trade, is
liable for the first offence to be fined in any sum not exceeding one
hundred pounds, and to three months imprisonment, and until the fine
shall be paid; and for the second offence, to be fined in any sum at the
 discretion of the court, and to imprisonment for twelve months, and
until the fine shall be paid. By the 23 Geo. II. chap. 13. this penalty
is increased for the first offence to five hundred pounds for every
artificer so enticed, and to twelve months imprisonment, and until the
fine shall be paid; and for the second offence, to one thousand pounds,
and to two years imprisonment, and until the fine shall be paid.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_422">By the former of those two statutes, upon
proof that any person has been enticing any artificer, or that any
artificer has promised or contracted to go into foreign parts for the
purposes aforesaid, such artificer may be obliged to give security at
the discretion of the court, that he shall not go beyond the seas, and
may be committed to prison until he give such security.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_423"><span class="type-margin"><span>and the artificer who exercises or teaches his trade abroad may be ordered to return.</span></span>If
 any artificer has gone beyond the seas, and is exercising or teaching
his trade in any foreign country, upon warning being given to him by any
 of his majesty’s ministers or consuls abroad, or by one of his
majesty’s secretaries of state for the time being, if he does not,
within six months after such warning, return into this realm, and from
thenceforth abide and inhabit continually within the same, he is from
thenceforth declared incapable of taking any legacy devised to him
within this kingdom, or of being executor or administrator to any
person, or of taking any lands within this kingdom by descent, devise,
or purchase. He likewise forfeits to the king, all his lands, goods and
chattels, is declared an alien in every respect, and is put out of the
king’s protection.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt305" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt305_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_424">It is unnecessary, I imagine, to observe, how
contrary such regulations are to the boasted liberty of the subject, of
which we affect to be so very jealous; but which, in this case, is so
plainly sacrificed to the futile interests of our merchants and
manufacturers.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>159<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_425">The laudable motive of all these regulations, is to extend our own<span class="type-margin"><span>The object is to depress the manufactures of our neighbours.</span></span>
 manufactures, not by their own improvement, but by the depression of
those of all our neighbours, and by putting an end, as much as possible,
 to the troublesome competition of such odious and disagreeable rivals.
Our master manufacturers think it reasonable, that they themselves
should have the monopoly of the ingenuity of all their countrymen.
Though by restraining, in some trades, the number of apprentices which
can be employed at one time, and by imposing the necessity of a long
apprenticeship in all trades, they endeavour, all of them, to confine
the knowledge of their respective employments to as small a number as
possible; they are unwilling, however, that any part of this small
number should go abroad to instruct foreigners.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_426">Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production; and the<span class="type-margin"><span>The mercantile system absurdly considers production and not consumption to be the end of industry and commerce.</span></span>
 interest of the producer ought to be attended to, only so far as it may
 be necessary for promoting that of the consumer. The maxim is so
perfectly self-evident, that it would be absurd to attempt to prove it.
But in the mercantile system, the interest of the consumer is almost
constantly sacrificed to that of the producer; and it seems to consider
production, and not consumption, as the ultimate end and object of all
industry and commerce.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_427">In the restraints upon the importation of all foreign commodities<span class="type-margin"><span>Restraints on importation of competing commodities sacrifice the interest of the consumer to the producer,</span></span>
 which can come into competition with those of our own growth, or
manufacture, the interest of the home-consumer is evidently sacrificed
to that of the producer. It is altogether for the benefit of the latter,
 that the former is obliged to pay that enhancement of price which this
monopoly almost always occasions.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_428">It is altogether for the benefit of the producer that bounties are<span class="type-margin"><span>and so do bounties on exportation,</span></span>
 granted upon the exportation of some of his productions. The
home-consumer is obliged to pay, first, the tax which is necessary for
paying the bounty, and secondly, the still greater tax which necessarily
 arises from the enhancement of the price of the commodity in the home
market.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_429">By the famous treaty of commerce with Portugal,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt306" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt306_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> the consumer is<span class="type-margin"><span>and the provisions of the Methuen treaty,</span></span>
 prevented by high duties from purchasing of a neighbouring country, a
commodity which our own climate does not produce, but is obliged to
purchase it of a distant country, though it is acknowledged, that the
commodity of the distant country is of a worse quality than that of the
near one. The home-consumer is obliged to submit to this inconveniency,
in order that the producer may import into the distant <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>160<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 country some of his productions upon more advantageous terms than he
would otherwise have been allowed to do. The consumer, too, is obliged
to pay, whatever enhancement in the price of those very productions,
this forced exportation may occasion in the home market.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_430"><span class="type-margin"><span>but the most extravagant case of all is that of the management of the American and West Indian colonies.</span></span>But
 in the system of laws which has been established for the management of
our American and West Indian colonies, the interest of the home-consumer
 has been sacrificed to that of the producer with a more extravagant
profusion than in all our other commercial regulations. A great empire
has been established for the sole purpose of raising up a nation of
customers who should be obliged to buy from the shops of our different
producers, all the goods with which these could supply them. For the
sake of that little enhancement of price which this monopoly might
afford our producers, the home-consumers have been burdened with the
whole expence of maintaining and defending that empire. For this
purpose, and for this purpose only, in the two last wars, more than two
hundred millions have been spent, and a new debt of more than a hundred
and seventy millions has been contracted over and above all that had
been expended for the same purpose in former wars. The interest of this
debt alone is not only greater than the whole extraordinary profit,
which, it ever could be pretended, was made by the monopoly of the
colony trade, but than the whole value of that trade, or than the whole
value of the goods, which at an average have been annually exported to
the colonies.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_431"><span class="type-margin"><span>The contrivers of the whole mercantile system are the producers and especially the merchants and manufacturers.</span></span>It
 cannot be very difficult to determine who have been the contrivers of
this whole mercantile system; not the consumers, we may believe, whose
interest has been entirely neglected; but the producers, whose interest
has been so carefully attended to; and among this latter class our
merchants and manufacturers have been by far the principal architects.
In the mercantile regulations, which have been taken notice of in this
chapter, the interest of our manufacturers has been most peculiarly
attended to; and the interest, not so much of the consumers, as that of
some other sets of producers, has been sacrificed to it.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt307" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt307_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>

 OF THOSE SYSTEMS OF POLITICAL ŒCONOMY, WHICH REPRESENT THE PRODUCE OF
LAND AS EITHER THE SOLE OR THE PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF THE REVENUE AND
WEALTH OF EVERY COUNTRY</h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-02_432">THE agricultural systems of political œconomy will not require so<span class="type-margin"><span>The agricultural systems will require less lengthy explanation than the mercantile system.</span></span> long an explanation as that which I have thought it necessary to bestow upon the mercantile or commercial system.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_433">That system which represents the produce of
land as the sole source of the revenue and wealth of every country has,
so far as I know, never been adopted by any nation, and it at present
exists only in the speculations of a few men of great learning and
ingenuity in France.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt308" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt308_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 It would not, surely, be worth while to examine at great length the
errors of a system which never has done, and probably never will do any
harm in any part of the world. I shall endeavour to explain, however, as
 distinctly as I can, the great outlines of this very ingenious system.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_434">Mr. Colbert, the famous minister of Lewis XIV. was a man of<span class="type-margin"><span>Colbert adopted the mercantile system and favoured town industry,</span></span>
 probity, of great industry and knowledge of detail; of great experience
 and acuteness in the examination of public accounts, and of abilities,
in short, every way fitted for introducing method and good order into
the collection and expenditure of the public revenue. That minister had
unfortunately embraced all the prejudices of the mercantile system, in
its nature and essence a system of restraint and regulation, and such as
 could scarce fail<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt309" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt309_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 to be agreeable to a laborious and plodding man of business, who had
been accustomed to regulate the different departments of public offices,
 and to establish the necessary checks and <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>162<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 controuls for confining each to its proper sphere. The industry and
commerce of a great country he endeavoured to regulate upon the same
model as the departments of a public office; and instead of allowing
every man to pursue his own interest his own way, upon the liberal plan
of equality, liberty and justice, he bestowed upon certain branches of
industry extraordinary privileges, while he laid others under as
extraordinary restraints. He was not only disposed, like other European
ministers, to encourage more the industry of the towns than that of the
country; but, in order to support the industry of the towns, he was
willing even to depress and keep down that of the country. In order to
render provisions cheap to the inhabitants of the towns, and thereby to
encourage manufactures and foreign commerce, he prohibited altogether
the exportation of corn, and thus excluded the inhabitants of the
country from every foreign market for by far the most important part of
the produce of their industry. This prohibition, joined to the
restraints imposed by the ancient provincial laws of France upon the
transportation of corn from one province to another, and to the
arbitrary and degrading taxes which are levied upon the cultivators in
almost all the provinces, discouraged and kept down the agriculture of
that country very much below the state to which it would naturally have
risen in so very fertile a soil and so very happy a climate. This state
of discouragement and depression was felt more or less in every
different part of the country, and many different inquiries were set on
foot concerning the causes of it. One of those causes appeared to be the
 preference given, by the institutions of Mr. Colbert, to the industry
of the towns above that of the country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_435"><span class="type-margin"><span>with the result that the French philosophers who support the agricultural system undervalue town industry.</span></span>If
 the rod be bent too much one way, says the proverb, in order to make it
 straight you must bend it as much the other. The French philosophers,
who have proposed the system which represents agriculture as the sole
source of the revenue and wealth of every country, seem to have adopted
this proverbial maxim; and as in the plan of Mr. Colbert the industry of
 the towns was certainly over-valued in comparison with that of the
country; so in their system it seems to be as certainly under-valued.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_436"><span class="type-margin"><span>There are three classes in their system: (1) proprietors, (2) cultivators, and (3) artificers, manufacturers and merchants.</span></span>The
 different orders of people who have ever been supposed to contribute in
 any respect towards the annual produce of the land and labour of the
country, they divide into three classes. The first is the class of the
proprietors of land. The second is the class of the cultivators, of
farmers and country labourers, whom they honour with the peculiar
appellation of the productive class. The third is the class of
artificers, manufacturers and merchants, whom they endeavour to degrade <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>163<span class="bracket">]</span></span> by the humiliating appellation<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt310" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt310_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> of the barren or unproductive class.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_437">The class of proprietors contributes to the annual produce by the<span class="type-margin"><span>Proprietors contribute to production by expenses on improvement of land</span></span>
 expence which they may occasionally lay out upon the improvement of the
 land, upon the buildings, drains, enclosures and other ameliorations,
which they may either make or maintain upon it, and by means of which
the cultivators are enabled, with the same capital, to raise a greater
produce, and consequently to pay a greater rent. This advanced rent may
be considered as the interest or profit due to the proprietor upon the
expence or capital which he thus employs in the improvement of his land.
 Such expences are in this system called ground expences (depenses
foncieres).</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_438">The cultivators or farmers contribute to the annual produce by what<span class="type-margin"><span>cultivators, by original and annual expenses of cultivation</span></span>
 are in this system called the original and annual expences (depenses
primitives et depenses annuelles) which they lay out upon the
cultivation of the land. The original expenses consist in the
instruments of husbandry, in the stock of cattle, in the seed, and in
the maintenance of the farmer’s family, servants and cattle, during at
least a great part of the first year of his occupancy, or till he can
receive some return from the land. The annual expences consist in the
seed, in the wear and tear<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt311" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt311_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 of the instruments of husbandry, and in the annual maintenance of the
farmer’s servants and cattle, and of his family too, so far as any part
of them can be considered as servants employed in cultivation. That part
 of the produce of the land which remains to him after paying the rent,
ought to be sufficient, first, to replace to him within a reasonable
time, at least during the term of his occupancy, the whole of his
original expences, together with the ordinary profits of stock; and,
secondly, to replace to him annually the whole of his annual expences,
together likewise with the ordinary profits of stock. Those two sorts of
 expences are two capitals which the farmer employs in cultivation; and
unless they are regularly restored to him, together with a reasonable
profit, he cannot carry on his employment upon a level with other
employments; but, from a regard to his own interest, must desert it as
soon as possible, and seek some other.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt312" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt312_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> That part of the produce of the land which is thus necessary for enabling the farmer to continue <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>164<span class="bracket">]</span></span> his business, ought to be considered as a fund sacred to cultivation, which if the landlord violates, he necessarily reduces<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt313" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt313_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 the produce of his own land, and in a few years not only disables the
farmer from paying this racked rent, but from paying the reasonable rent
 which he might otherwise have got for his land. The rent which properly
 belongs to the landlord, is no more than the neat produce which remains
 after paying in the completest manner all the necessary expences which
must be previously laid out in order to raise the gross, or the whole
produce. It is because the labour of the cultivators, over and above
paying completely all those necessary expences, affords a neat produce
of this kind, that this class of people are in this system peculiarly
distinguished by the honourable appellation of the productive class.
Their original and annual expences are for the same reason called, in
this system, productive expences, because, over and above replacing
their own value, they occasion the annual reproduction of this neat
produce.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_439"><span class="type-margin"><span>These expenses should be free from all taxation.</span></span>The
 ground expences, as they are called, or what the landlord lays out upon
 the improvement of his land, are in this system too honoured with the
appellation of productive expences. Till the whole of those expences,
together with the ordinary profits of stock, have been completely repaid
 to him by the advanced rent which he gets from his land, that advanced
rent ought to be regarded as sacred and inviolable, both by the church
and by the king; ought to be subject neither to tithe nor to taxation.
If it is otherwise, by discouraging the improvement of land, the church
discourages the future increase of her own tithes, and the king the
future increase of his own taxes. As in a well-ordered state of things,
therefore, those ground expences, over and above reproducing in the
completest manner their own value, occasion likewise after a certain
time a reproduction of a neat produce, they are in this system
considered as productive expences.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_440"><span class="type-margin"><span>All other expenses and orders of people are unproductive</span></span>The
 ground expences of the landlord, however, together with the original
and the annual expences of the farmer, are the only three sorts of
expences which in this system are considered as productive. All other
expences and all other orders of people, even those who in the common
apprehensions of men are regarded as the most productive, are in this
account of things represented as altogether barren and unproductive.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_441"><span class="type-margin"><span>artificers and manufacturers in particular, and the expense of employing them.</span></span>Artificers
 and manufacturers, in particular, whose industry, in the common
apprehensions of men, increases so much the value of the rude produce of
 land, are in this system represented as a class of people altogether
barren and unproductive. Their labour, it is said, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>165<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 replaces only the stock which employs them, together with its ordinary
profits. That stock consists in the materials, tools, and wages,
advanced to them by their employer; and is the fund destined for their
employment and maintenance. Its profits are the fund destined for the
maintenance of their employer. Their employer, as he advances to them
the stock of materials, tools and wages necessary for their employment,
so he advances to himself what is necessary for his own maintenance, and
 this maintenance he generally proportions to the profit which he
expects to make by the price of their work. Unless its price repays to
him the maintenance which he advances to himself, as well as the
materials, tools and wages which he advances to his workmen, it
evidently does not repay to him<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt314" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt314_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 the whole expence which he lays out upon it. The profits of
manufacturing stock, therefore, are not, like the rent of land, a neat
produce which remains after completely repaying the whole expence which
must be laid out in order to obtain them. The stock of the farmer yields
 him a profit as well as that of the master manufacturer; and it yields a
 rent likewise to another person, which that of the master manufacturer
does not. The expence, therefore, laid out in employing and maintaining
artificers and manufacturers, does no more than continue, if one may say
 so, the existence of its own value, and does not produce any new value.
 It is therefore altogether a barren and unproductive expence. The
expence, on the contrary, laid out in employing farmers and country
labourers, over and above continuing the existence of its own value,
produces a new value, the rent of the landlord. It is therefore a
productive expence.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_442">Mercantile stock is equally barren and unproductive with manufacturing<span class="type-margin"><span>mercantile stock also</span></span>
 stock. It only continues the existence of its own value, without
producing any new value. Its profits are only the repayment of the
maintenance which its employer advances to himself during the time that
he employs it, or till he receives the returns of it. They are only the
repayment of a part of the expence which must be laid out in employing
it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_443">The labour of artificers and manufacturers never adds any thing to<span class="type-margin"><span>The labour of artificers and manufacturers adds nothing to the value of the annual produce</span></span>
 the value of the whole annual amount of the rude produce of the land.
It adds indeed greatly to the value of some particular parts of it. But
the consumption which in the mean time it occasions of other parts, is
precisely equal to the value which it adds to those parts; so that the
value of the whole amount is not, at any one moment of time, in the
least augmented by it. The person who works the lace of a pair of fine
ruffles, for example, will sometimes raise the value of perhaps <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>166<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 a pennyworth of flax to thirty pounds sterling. But though at first
sight he appears thereby to multiply the value of a part of the rude
produce about seven thousand and two hundred times, he in reality adds
nothing to the value of the whole annual amount of the rude produce. The
 working of that lace costs him perhaps two years labour. The thirty
pounds which he gets for it when it is finished, is no more than the
repayment of the subsistence which he advances to himself during the two
 years that he is employed about it. The value which, by every day’s,
month’s, or year’s labour, he adds to the flax, does no more than
replace the value of his own consumption during that day, month, or
year. At no moment of time, therefore, does he add any thing to the
value of the whole annual amount of the rude produce of the land: the
portion of that produce which he is continually consuming, being always
equal to the value which he is continually producing. The extreme
poverty of the greater part of the persons employed in this expensive,
though trifling manufacture, may satisfy us that the price of their work
 does not in ordinary cases exceed the value of their subsistence. It is
 otherwise with the work of farmers and country labourers. The rent of
the landlord is a value, which, in ordinary cases, it is continually
producing, over and above replacing, in the most complete manner, the
whole consumption, the whole expence laid out upon the employment and
maintenance both of the workmen and of their employer.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_444"><span class="type-margin"><span>Artificers, manufacturers and merchants can augment revenue only by privation.</span></span>Artificers,
 manufacturers and merchants, can augment the revenue and wealth of
their society, by parsimony only; or, as it is expressed in this system,
 by privation, that is, by depriving themselves of a part of the funds
destined for their own subsistence. They annually reproduce nothing but
those funds. Unless, therefore, they annually save some part of them,
unless they annually deprive themselves of the enjoyment of some part of
 them, the revenue and wealth of their society can never be in the
smallest degree augmented by means of their industry. Farmers and
country labourers, on the contrary, may enjoy completely the whole funds
 destined for their own subsistence, and yet augment at the same time
the revenue and wealth of their society. Over and above what is destined<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt315" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt315_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 for their own subsistence, their industry annually affords a neat
produce, of which the augmentation necessarily augments the revenue and
wealth of their society. Nations, therefore, which, like France or
England, consist in a great measure of proprietors and cultivators, can
be enriched by industry and enjoyment. Nations, on the contrary, which,
like Holland and <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>167<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 Hamburgh, are composed chiefly of merchants, artificers and
manufacturers, can grow rich only through parsimony and privation. As
the interest of nations so differently circumstanced, is very different,
 so is likewise the common character of the people. In those of the
former kind, liberality, frankness, and good fellowship, naturally make a
 part of that common character. In the latter, narrowness, meanness, and
 a selfish disposition, averse to all social pleasure and enjoyment.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_445">The unproductive class, that of merchants, artificers and manufacturers,<span class="type-margin"><span>The unproductive class is maintained at the expense of the other two,</span></span>
 is maintained and employed altogether at the expence of the two other
classes, of that of proprietors, and of that of cultivators. They
furnish it both with the materials of its work and with the fund of its
subsistence, with the corn and cattle which it consumes while it is
employed about that work. The proprietors and cultivators finally pay
both the wages of all the workmen of the unproductive class, and the
profits of all their employers. Those workmen and their employers are
properly the servants of the proprietors and cultivators. They are only
servants who work without doors, as menial servants work within. Both
the one and the other, however, are equally maintained at the expence of
 the same masters. The labour of both is equally unproductive. It adds
nothing to the value of the sum total of the rude produce of the land.
Instead of increasing the value of that sum total, it is a charge and
expence which must be paid out of it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_446">The unproductive class, however, is not only useful, but greatly useful<span class="type-margin"><span>but is useful to them,</span></span>
 to the other two classes. By means of the industry of merchants,
artificers and manufacturers, the proprietors and cultivators can
purchase both the foreign goods and the manufactured produce of their
own country which they have occasion for, with the produce of a much
smaller quantity of their own labour, than what they would be obliged to
 employ, if they were to attempt, in an aukward and unskilful manner,
either to import the one, or to make the other for their own use. By
means of the unproductive class, the cultivators are delivered from many
 cares which would otherwise distract their attention from the
cultivation of land. The superiority of produce, which, in consequence
of this undivided attention, they are enabled to raise, is fully
sufficient to pay the whole expence which the maintenance and employment
 of the unproductive class costs either the proprietors, or themselves.
The industry of merchants, artificers and manufacturers, though in its
own nature altogether unproductive, yet contributes in this manner
indirectly to increase the produce of the land. It increases the
productive powers of productive labour, by leaving it at liberty to
confine itself to its proper employment, the cultivation of land; and
the plough goes frequently <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>168<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the easier and the better by means of the labour of the man whose business is most remote from the plough.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_447"><span class="type-margin"><span>and it is not their interest to discourage its industry;</span></span>It
 can never be the interest of the proprietors and cultivators to
restrain or to discourage in any respect the industry of merchants,
artificers and manufacturers. The greater the liberty which this
unproductive class enjoys, the greater will be the competition in all
the different trades which compose it, and the cheaper will the other
two classes be supplied, both with foreign goods and with the
manufactured produce of their own country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_448"><span class="type-margin"><span>nor is it ever the interest of the unproductive class to oppress the others.</span></span>It
 can never be the interest of the unproductive class to oppress the
other two classes. It is the surplus produce of the land, or what
remains after deducting the maintenance, first, of the cultivators, and
afterwards, of the proprietors, that maintains and employs the
unproductive class. The greater this surplus, the greater must likewise
be the maintenance and employment of that class.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt316" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt316_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The establishment of perfect justice, of perfect liberty, and of
perfect equality, is the very simple secret which most effectually
secures the highest degree of prosperity to all the three classes.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_449"><span class="type-margin"><span>Mercantile states similarly are maintained at the expense of landed states,</span></span>The
 merchants, artificers and manufacturers of those mercantile states
which, like Holland and Hamburgh, consist chiefly of this unproductive
class, are in the same manner maintained and employed altogether at the
expence of the proprietors and cultivators of land. The only difference
is, that those proprietors and cultivators are, the greater part of
them, placed at a most inconvenient distance from the merchants,
artificers and manufacturers whom they supply with the materials of
their work and the fund of their subsistence, are the inhabitants of
other countries, and the subjects of other governments.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_450"><span class="type-margin"><span>but are greatly useful to them.</span></span>Such
 mercantile states, however, are not only useful, but greatly useful to
the inhabitants of those other countries. They fill up, in some measure,
 a very important void, and supply the place of the merchants,
artificers and manufacturers, whom the inhabitants of those countries
ought to find at home, but whom, from some defect in their policy, they
do not find at home.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_451"><span class="type-margin"><span>and it is not the interest of landed nations to discourage their industry by high duties</span></span>It
 can never be the interest of those landed nations, if I may call them
so, to discourage or distress the industry of such mercantile states, by
 imposing high duties upon their trade, or upon the commodities which
they furnish. Such duties, by rendering those commodities dearer, could
serve only to sink the real value of the surplus produce of their own
land, with which, or, what comes to the same thing, with the price of
which, those commodities are purchased. <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>169<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 Such duties could serve only to discourage the increase of that surplus
 produce, and consequently the improvement and cultivation of their own
land. The most effectual expedient, on the contrary, for raising the
value of that surplus produce, for encouraging its increase, and
consequently the improvement and cultivation of their own land, would be
 to allow the most perfect freedom to the trade of all such mercantile
nations.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_452">This perfect freedom of trade would even be the most effectual<span class="type-margin"><span>Freedom of trade would in due time supply artificers, etc., at home.</span></span>
 expedient for supplying them, in due time, with all the artificers,
manufacturers and merchants, whom they wanted at home, and for filling
up in the properest and most advantageous manner that very important
void which they felt there.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_453">The continual increase of the surplus produce of their land, would,<span class="type-margin"><span>in consequence of the increase of their capital, which would first employ manufacturers,</span></span>
 in due time, create a greater capital than what could be employed with
the ordinary rate of profit in the improvement and cultivation of land;
and the surplus part of it would naturally turn itself to the employment
 of artificers and manufacturers at home. But those artificers and
manufacturers, finding at home both the materials of their work and the
fund of their subsistence, might immediately, even with much less art
and skill, be able to work as cheap as the like artificers and
manufacturers of such mercantile states, who had both to bring from a
great<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt317" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt317_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 distance. Even though, from want of art and skill, they might not for
some time be able to work as cheap, yet, finding a market at home, they
might be able to sell their work there as cheap as that of the
artificers and manufacturers of such mercantile states, which could not
be brought to that market but from so great a distance; and as their art
 and skill improved, they would soon be able to sell it cheaper. The
artificers and manufacturers of such mercantile states, therefore, would
 immediately be rivalled in the market of those landed nations, and soon
 after undersold and justled out of it altogether. The cheapness of the
manufactures of those landed nations, in consequence of the gradual
improvements of art and skill, would, in due time, extend their sale
beyond the home market, and carry them to many foreign markets, from
which they would in the same manner gradually justle out many of the
manufactures of such mercantile nations.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_454">This continual increase both of the rude and manufactured produce<span class="type-margin"><span>and afterwards overflow into foreign trade</span></span>
 of those landed nations would in due time create a greater capital than
 could, with the ordinary rate of profit, be employed either in
agriculture or in manufactures. The surplus of this capital would
naturally turn itself to foreign trade, and be employed in exporting, to
 foreign countries, such parts of the rude and manufactured produce of
its <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>170<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 own country, as exceeded the demand of the home market. In the
exportation of the produce of their own country, the merchants of a
landed nation would have an advantage of the same kind over those of
mercantile nations, which its artificers and manufacturers had over the
artificers and manufacturers of such nations; the advantage of finding
at home that cargo, and those stores and provisions, which the others
were obliged to seek for at a distance. With inferior art and skill in
navigation, therefore, they would be able to sell that cargo as cheap in
 foreign markets as the merchants of such mercantile nations; and with
equal art and skill they would be able to sell it cheaper. They would
soon, therefore, rival those mercantile nations in this branch of
foreign trade,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt318" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt318_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> and in due time would justle them out of it altogether.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_455"><span class="type-margin"><span>Freedom of trade therefore is best for introducing manufactures and foreign trade.</span></span>According
 to this liberal and generous system, therefore, the most advantageous
method in which a landed nation can raise up artificers, manufacturers
and merchants of its own, is to grant the most perfect freedom of trade
to the artificers, manufacturers and merchants of all other nations. It
thereby raises the value of the surplus produce of its own land, of
which the continual increase gradually establishes a fund, which in due
time necessarily raises up all the artificers, manufacturers and
merchants whom it has occasion for.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_456"><span class="type-margin"><span>High duties and prohibitions sink the value of agricultural produce, raise mercantile and manufacturing profit.</span></span>When
 a landed nation, on the contrary, oppresses either by high duties or by
 prohibitions the trade of foreign nations, it necessarily hurts its own
 interest in two different ways. First, by raising the price of all
foreign goods and of all sorts of manufactures, it necessarily sinks the
 real value of the surplus produce of its own land, with which, or, what
 comes to the same thing, with the price of which, it purchases those
foreign goods and manufactures. Secondly, by giving a sort of monopoly
of the home market to its own merchants, artificers and manufacturers,
it raises the rate of mercantile and manufacturing profit in proportion
to that of agricultural profit, and consequently either draws from
agriculture a part of the capital which had before been employed in it,
or hinders from going to it a part of what would otherwise have gone to
it. This policy, therefore, discourages agriculture in two different
ways; first, by sinking the real value of its produce, and thereby
lowering the rate of its profit; and, secondly, by raising the rate of
profit in all other employments. Agriculture is rendered less
advantageous, and trade and manufactures more advantageous than they
otherwise would be; and every man is tempted by his own interest to
turn, as much as he can, both his capital and his industry from the
former to the latter employments.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>171<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_457">Though, by this oppressive policy, a landed nation should be able<span class="type-margin"><span>and could only raise up manufacturers and merchants prematurely.</span></span>
 to raise up artificers, manufacturers and merchants of its own,
somewhat sooner than it could do by the freedom of trade; a matter,
however, which is not a little doubtful; yet it would raise them up, if
one may say so, prematurely, and before it was perfectly ripe for them.
By raising up too hastily one species of industry, it would depress
another more valuable species of industry. By raising up too hastily a
species of industry which only replaces the stock which employs it,
together with the ordinary profit, it would depress a species of
industry which, over and above replacing that stock with its profit,
affords likewise a neat produce, a free rent to the landlord. It would
depress productive labour, by encouraging too hastily that labour which
is altogether barren and unproductive.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_458">In what manner, according to this system, the sum total of the<span class="type-margin"><span>The distribution of the produce of land is represented in the Economical Table.</span></span>
 annual produce of the land is distributed among the three classes above
 mentioned, and in what manner the labour of the unproductive class does
 no more than replace the value of its own consumption, without
increasing in any respect the value of that sum total, is represented by
 Mr. Quesnai, the very ingenious and profound author of this system, in
some arithmetical formularies. The first of these formularies, which by
way of eminence he peculiarly distinguishes by the name of the
Œconomical Table,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt319" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt319_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 represents the manner in which he supposes this distribution takes
place, in a state of the most perfect liberty, and therefore of the
highest prosperity; in a state where the annual produce is such as to
afford the greatest possible neat produce, and where each class enjoys
its proper share of the whole annual produce. Some subsequent
formularies represent the manner, in which, he supposes, this
distribution is made in different states of restraint and regulation; in
 which, either the class of proprietors, or the barren and unproductive
class, is more favoured than the class of cultivators, and in which,
either the one or the other encroaches more or less upon the share which
 ought properly to belong to this productive class. Every such
encroachment, every violation of that natural distribution, which the
most perfect liberty would establish, must, according to this system,
necessarily degrade more or less, from one year to another, the value
and sum total of the annual produce, and must necessarily occasion a
gradual declension in the real wealth and revenue of the society; a
declension of which the progress must be quicker or slower, according to
 the degree of this encroachment, according as that natural
distribution, which the most perfect liberty would establish, is more or
 less violated. <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>172<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 Those subsequent formularies represent the different degrees of
declension, which, according to this system, correspond to the different
 degrees in which this natural distribution of things is violated.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_459"><span class="type-margin"><span>Nations can prosper in spite of hurtful regulations.</span></span>Some
 speculative physicians seem to have imagined that the health of the
human body could be preserved only by a certain precise regimen of diet
and exercise, of which every, the smallest, violation necessarily
occasioned some degree of disease or disorder proportioned to the degree
 of the violation. Experience, however, would seem to show, that the
human body frequently preserves, to all appearance at least,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt320" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt320_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 the most perfect state of health under a vast variety of different
regimens; even under some which are generally believed to be very far
from being perfectly wholesome. But the healthful state of the human
body, it would seem, contains in itself some unknown principle of
preservation, capable either of preventing or of correcting, in many
respects, the bad effects even of a very faulty regimen. Mr. Quesnai,
who was himself a physician, and a very speculative physician, seems to
have entertained a notion of the same kind concerning the political
body, and to have imagined that it would thrive and prosper only under a
 certain precise regimen, the exact regimen of perfect liberty and
perfect justice. He seems not to have considered that in the political
body, the natural effort which every man is continually making to better
 his own condition, is a principle of preservation capable of preventing
 and correcting, in many respects, the bad effects of a political
œconomy, in some degree both partial and oppressive. Such a political
œconomy, though it no doubt retards more or less, is not always capable
of stopping altogether the natural progress of a nation towards wealth
and prosperity, and still less of making it go backwards. If a nation
could not prosper without the enjoyment of perfect liberty and perfect
justice, there is not in the world a nation which could ever have
prospered. In the political body, however, the wisdom of nature has
fortunately made ample provision for remedying many of the bad effects
of the folly and injustice of man; in the same manner as it has done in
the natural body, for remedying those of his sloth and intemperance.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_460"><span class="type-margin"><span>The system is wrong in representing artificers, etc., as unproductive, since,</span></span>The
 capital error of this system, however, seems to lie in its representing
 the class of artificers, manufacturers and merchants, as altogether
barren and unproductive. The following observations may serve to show
the impropriety of this representation.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_461"><span class="type-margin"><span>(1) they reproduce at least their annual consumption and continue the capital which employs them,</span></span>First,
 this class, it is acknowledged, reproduces annually the value of its
own annual consumption, and continues, at least, the existence of the
stock or capital which maintains and employs it. But upon this <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>173<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 account alone the denomination of barren or unproductive should seem to
 be very improperly applied to it. We should not call a marriage barren
or unproductive, though it produced only a son and a daughter, to
replace the father and mother, and though it did not increase the number
 of the human species, but only continued it as it was before. Farmers
and country labourers, indeed, over and above the stock which maintains
and employs them, reproduce annually a neat produce, a free rent to the
landlord. As a marriage which affords three children is certainly more
productive than one which affords only two; so the labour of farmers and
 country labourers is certainly more productive than that of merchants,
artificers and manufacturers. The superior produce of the one class,
however, does not render the other barren or unproductive.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_462">Secondly, it seems, upon this account, altogether improper to consider<span class="type-margin"><span><span id="lf0206-02_label_371">(2)</span> they are not like menial servants,</span></span>
 artificers, manufacturers and merchants, in the same light as menial
servants. The labour of menial servants does not continue the existence
of the fund which maintains and employs them. Their maintenance and
employment is altogether at the expence of their masters, and the work
which they perform is not of a nature to repay that expence. That work
consists in services which perish generally in the very instant of their
 performance, and does not fix or realize itself in any vendible
commodity which can replace the value of their wages and maintenance.
The labour, on the contrary, of artificers, manufacturers and merchants,
 naturally does fix and realize itself in some such vendible commodity.
It is upon this account that, in the chapter in which I treat of
productive and unproductive labour,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt321" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt321_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 I have classed artificers, manufacturers and merchants, among the
productive labourers, and menial servants among the barren or
unproductive.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_463">Thirdly, it seems, upon every supposition, improper to say, that the<span class="type-margin"><span><span id="lf0206-02_label_373">(3)</span> their labour increases the real revenue of the society,</span></span>
 labour of artificers, manufacturers and merchants, does not increase
the real revenue of the society. Though we should suppose, for example,
as it seems to be supposed in this system, that the value of the daily,
monthly, and yearly consumption of this class was exactly equal to that
of its daily, monthly, and yearly production; yet it would not from
thence follow that its labour added nothing to the real revenue, to the
real value of the annual produce of the land and labour of the society.
An artificer, for example, who, in the first six months after harvest,
executes ten pounds worth of work, though he should in the same time
consume ten pounds worth of corn and other necessaries, yet really adds
the value of ten pounds to the annual produce of the land and labour of
the society. While he has been consuming a half yearly revenue <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>174<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of ten pounds worth of corn and other necessaries, he has produced an
equal value of work capable of purchasing, either to himself or to some
other person, an equal half yearly revenue. The value, therefore, of
what has been consumed and produced during these six months is equal,
not to ten, but to twenty pounds. It is possible, indeed, that no more
than ten pounds worth of this value, may ever have existed at any one
moment of time. But if the ten pounds worth of corn and other
necessaries, which were consumed by the artificer, had been consumed by a
 soldier or by a menial servant, the value of that part of the annual
produce which existed at the end of the six months, would have been ten
pounds less than it actually is in consequence of the labour of the
artificer. Though the value of what the artificer produces, therefore,
should not at any one moment of time be supposed greater than the value
he consumes, yet at every moment of time the actually existing value of
goods in the market is, in consequence of what he produces, greater than
 it otherwise would be.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_464">When the patrons of this system assert, that
the consumption of artificers, manufacturers and merchants, is equal to
the value of what they produce, they probably mean no more than that
their revenue, or the fund destined for their consumption, is equal to
it. But if they had expressed themselves more accurately, and only
asserted, that the revenue of this class was equal to the value of what
they produced, it might readily have occurred to the reader, that what
would naturally be saved out of this revenue, must necessarily increase
more or less the real wealth of the society. In order, therefore, to
make out something like an argument, it was necessary that they should
express themselves as they have done; and this argument, even supposing
things actually were as it seems to presume them to be, turns out to be a
 very inconclusive one.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_465"><span class="type-margin"><span><span id="lf0206-02_label_374">(4)</span> for augmenting annual produce parsimony is just as much required from farmers as from them,</span></span>Fourthly,
 farmers and country labourers can no more augment, without parsimony,
the real revenue, the annual produce of the land and labour of their
society, than artificers, manufacturers and merchants. The annual
produce of the land and labour of any society can be augmented only in
two ways; either, first, by some improvement in the productive powers of
 the useful labour actually maintained within it; or, secondly, by some
increase in the quantity of that labour.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_466">The improvement in the productive powers of
useful labour depend, first, upon the improvement in the ability of the
workman; and, secondly, upon that of the machinery with which he works.
But the labour of artificers and manufacturers, as it is capable of
being more subdivided, and the labour of each workman reduced to a
greater <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>175<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 simplicity of operation, than that of farmers and country labourers, so
 it is likewise capable of both these sorts of improvement in a much
higher degree.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt322" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt322_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> In this respect, therefore, the class of cultivators can have no sort of advantage over that of artificers and manufacturers.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_467">The increase in the quantity of useful labour
actually employed within any society, must depend altogether upon the
increase of the capital which employs it; and the increase of that
capital again must be exactly equal to the amount of the savings from
the revenue, either of the particular persons who manage and direct the
employment of that capital, or of some other persons who lend it to
them. If merchants, artificers and manufacturers are, as this system
seems to suppose, naturally more inclined to parsimony and saving than
proprietors and cultivators, they are, so far, more likely to augment
the quantity of useful labour employed within their society, and
consequently to increase its real revenue, the annual produce of its
land and labour.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_468">Fifthly and lastly, though the revenue of the inhabitants of every<span class="type-margin"><span>and (5) trade and manufactures can procure that subsistence which the system regards as the only revenue.</span></span>
 country was supposed to consist altogether, as this system seems to
suppose, in the quantity of subsistence which their industry could
procure to them; yet, even upon this supposition, the revenue of a
trading and manufacturing country must, other things being equal, always
 be much greater than that of one without trade or manufactures. By
means of trade and manufactures, a greater quantity of subsistence can
be annually imported into a particular country than what its own lands,
in the actual state of their cultivation, could afford. The inhabitants
of a town, though they frequently possess no lands of their own, yet
draw to themselves by their industry such a quantity of the rude produce
 of the lands of other people as supplies them, not only with the
materials of their work, but with the fund of their subsistence. What a
town always is with regard to the country in its neighbourhood, one
independent state or country may frequently be with regard to other
independent states or countries. It is thus that Holland draws a great
part of its subsistence from other countries; live cattle from Holstein
and Jutland, and corn from almost all the different countries of Europe.
 A small quantity of manufactured produce purchases a great quantity of
rude produce. A trading and manufacturing country, therefore, naturally
purchases with a small part of its manufactured produce a great part of
the rude produce of other countries; while, on the contrary, a country
without trade and manufactures is generally obliged to purchase, at the
expence of a great part of its rude produce, a very small part of the
manufactured produce of other countries. The one exports <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>176<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 what can subsist and accommodate but a very few, and imports the
subsistence and accommodation of a great number. The other exports the
accommodation and subsistence of a great number, and imports that of a
very few only. The inhabitants of the one must always enjoy a much
greater quantity of subsistence than what their own lands, in the actual
 state of their cultivation, could afford. The inhabitants of the other
must always enjoy a much smaller quantity.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_469"><span class="type-margin"><span>In spite of its errors the system has been valuable.</span></span>This
 system, however, with all its imperfections, is, perhaps, the nearest
approximation to the truth that has yet been published upon the subject
of political œconomy, and is upon that account well worth the
consideration of every man who wishes to examine with attention the
principles of that very important science. Though in representing the
labour which is employed upon land as the only productive labour, the
notions which it inculcates are perhaps too narrow and confined; yet in
representing the wealth of nations as consisting, not in the
unconsumable riches of money, but in the consumable goods annually
reproduced by the labour of the society; and in representing perfect
liberty as the only effectual expedient for rendering this annual
reproduction the greatest possible, its doctrine seems to be in every
respect as just as it is generous and liberal. Its followers are very
numerous; and as men are fond of paradoxes, and of appearing to
understand what surpasses the comprehension of ordinary people, the
paradox which it maintains, concerning the unproductive nature of
manufacturing labour, has not perhaps contributed a little to increase
the number of its admirers. They have for some years past made a pretty
considerable sect, distinguished in the French republic of letters by
the name of, The Œconomists. Their works have certainly been of some
service to their country; not only by bringing into general discussion,
many subjects which had never been well examined before, but by
influencing in some measure the public administration in favour of
agriculture. It has been in consequence of their representations,
accordingly, that the agriculture of France has been delivered from
several of the oppressions which it before laboured under. The term
during which such a lease can be granted, as will be valid against every
 future purchaser or proprietor of the land, has been prolonged from
nine to twenty-seven years.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt323" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt323_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The ancient provincial restraints upon the transportation of corn from

 numerous, and which treat not only of what is properly called Political
 Œconomy, or of the nature and causes of the wealth of nations, but of
every other branch of the system of civil government, all follow
implicitly, and without any sensible variation, the doctrine of Mr.
Quesnai. There is upon this account little variety in the greater part
of their works. The most distinct and best connected account of this
doctrine is to be found in a little book written by Mr. Mercier de la
Riviere, sometime Intendant of Martinico, intitled, The natural and
essential Order of Political Societies.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt325" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt325_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The admiration of this whole sect for their master, who was himself a
man of the greatest modesty and simplicity, is not inferior to that of
any of the ancient philosophers for the founders of their respective
systems. “There have been, since the world began,” says a very diligent
and respectable author, the Marquis de Mirabeau, “three great inventions
 which have principally given stability to political societies,
independent of many other inventions which have enriched and adorned
them. The first, is the invention of writing, which alone gives human
nature the power of transmitting, without alteration, its laws, its
contracts, its annals, and its discoveries. The second, is the invention
 of money, which binds together all the relations between civilized
societies. The third, is the Œconomical Table, the result of the other
two, which completes them both by perfecting their object; the great
discovery of our age, but of which our posterity will reap the benefit.”<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt326" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt326_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_470">As the political œconomy of the nations of modern Europe, has been<span class="type-margin"><span>Some nations have favoured agriculture</span></span>
 more favourable to manufactures and foreign trade, the industry of the
towns, than to agriculture, the industry of the country; so that of
other nations has followed a different plan, and has been more
favourable to agriculture than to manufactures and foreign trade.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_471">The policy of China favours agriculture more than all other employments.<span class="type-margin"><span>China, for example.</span></span><a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt327" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt327_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> In China, the condition of a labourer is said to be as much <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>178<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 superior to that of an artificer; as in most parts of Europe, that of
an artificer is to that of a labourer. In China, the great ambition of
every man is to get possession of some little bit of land, either in
property or in lease; and leases are there said to be granted upon very
moderate terms, and to be sufficiently secured to the lessees. The
Chinese have little respect for foreign trade. Your beggarly commerce!
was the language in which the Mandarins of Pekin used to talk to Mr. de
Lange,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt328" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt328_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> the Russian envoy, concerning it.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt329" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt329_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 Except with Japan, the Chinese carry on, themselves, and in their own
bottoms, little or no foreign trade; and it is only into one or two
ports of their kingdom that they even admit the ships of foreign
nations. Foreign trade, therefore, is, in China, every way confined
within a much narrower circle than that to which it would naturally
extend itself, if more freedom was allowed to it, either in their own
ships, or in those of foreign nations.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_472"><span class="type-margin"><span>China is itself of very great extent, but more foreign trade would be advantageous to it.</span></span>Manufactures,
 as in a small bulk they frequently contain a great value, and can upon
that account be transported at less expence from one country to another
than most parts<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt330" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt330_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 of rude produce, are, in almost all countries, the principal support of
 foreign trade. In countries, besides, less extensive and less
favourably circumstanced for interior commerce than China, they
generally require the support of foreign trade. Without an extensive
foreign market, they could not well flourish, either in countries so
moderately extensive as to afford but a narrow home market; or in
countries where the communication between one province and another was
so difficult, as to render it impossible for the goods of any particular
 place to enjoy the whole of that home market which the country could
afford. The perfection of manufacturing industry, it must be remembered,
 depends altogether upon the division of labour; and the degree to which
 the division of labour can be introduced into any manufacture, is
necessarily regulated, it has already been shown,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt331" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt331_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 by the extent of the market. But the great extent of the empire of
China, the vast multitude of its inhabitants, the variety of climate,
and consequently of productions in its different provinces, and the easy
 communication by means of water carriage between the greater part of
them, render the home market of that country of so great extent, as to
be alone sufficient to support very great manufactures, and to admit of
very considerable subdivisions of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>179<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 labour. The home market of China is, perhaps, in extent, not much
inferior to the market of all the different countries of Europe put
together.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt332" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt332_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 A more extensive foreign trade, however, which to this great home
market added the foreign market of all the rest of the world; especially
 if any considerable part of this trade was carried on in Chinese ships;
 could scarce fail to increase very much the manufactures of China, and
to improve very much the productive powers of its manufacturing
industry. By a more extensive navigation, the Chinese would naturally
learn the art of using and constructing themselves all the different
machines made use of in other countries, as well as the other<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt333" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt333_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 improvements of art and industry which are practised in all the
different parts of the world. Upon their present plan they have little
opportunity of improving themselves by the example of any other nation;
except that of the Japanese.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_473">The policy of ancient Egypt too, and that of the Gentoo government<span class="type-margin"><span>Egypt and the Gentoo government of Indostan favoured agriculture. The people were divided into castes in these countries.</span></span> of Indostan, seem to have favoured agriculture more than all other employments.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_474">Both in ancient Egypt and<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt334" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt334_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 Indostan, the whole body of the people was divided into different casts
 or tribes, each of which was confined, from father to son, to a
particular employment or class of employments. The son of a priest was
necessarily a priest; the son of a soldier, a soldier; the son of a
labourer, a labourer; the son of a weaver, a weaver; the son of a
taylor, a taylor; &amp;c. In both countries, the cast of the priests
held the highest rank, and that of the soldiers the next; and in both
countries, the cast of the farmers and labourers was superior to the
casts of merchants and manufacturers.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_475">The government of both countries was particularly attentive to the<span class="type-margin"><span>Irrigation was attended to there.</span></span>
 interest of agriculture. The works constructed by the ancient
sovereigns of Egypt for the proper distribution of the waters of the
Nile were famous in antiquity; and the ruined remains of some of them
are still the admiration of travellers. Those of the same kind which
were constructed by the ancient sovereigns of Indostan, for the proper
distribution of the waters of the Ganges as well as of many other
rivers, though they have been less celebrated, seem to have been equally
 great. Both countries, accordingly, though subject occasionally to
dearths, have been famous for their great fertility. Though both were
extremely populous, yet, in years of moderate plenty, they were both
able to export great quantities of grain to their neighbours.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>180<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_476"><span class="type-margin"><span>Egypt and India were dependent on other nations for foreign trade</span></span>The
 ancient Egyptians had a superstitious aversion to the sea; and as the
Gentoo religion does not permit its followers to light a fire, nor
consequently to dress any victuals upon the water, it in effect
prohibits them from all distant sea voyages. Both the Egyptians and
Indians must have depended almost altogether upon the navigation of
other nations for the exportation of their surplus produce; and this
dependency, as it must have confined the market, so it must have
discouraged the increase of this surplus produce. It must have
discouraged too the increase of the manufactured produce more than that
of the rude produce. Manufactures require a much more extensive market
than the most important parts of the rude produce of the land. A single
shoemaker will make more than three hundred pairs of shoes in the year;
and his own family will not perhaps wear out six pairs. Unless therefore
 he has the custom of at least fifty such families as his own, he cannot
 dispose of the whole produce of his own labour. The most numerous class
 of artificers will seldom, in a large country, make more than one in
fifty or one in a hundred of the whole number of families contained in
it. But in such large countries as France and England, the number of
people employed in agriculture has by some authors been computed at a
half, by others at a third, and by no author that I know of, at less
than a fifth of the whole inhabitants of the country. But as the produce
 of the agriculture of both France and England is, the far greater part
of it, consumed at home, each person employed in it must, according to
these computations, require little more than the custom of one, two, or,
 at most, of<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt335" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt335_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 four such families as his own, in order to dispose of the whole produce
 of his own labour. Agriculture, therefore, can support itself under the
 discouragement of a confined market, much better than manufactures. In
both ancient Egypt and Indostan, indeed, the confinement of the foreign
market was in some measure compensated by the conveniency of many inland
 navigations, which opened, in the most advantageous manner, the whole
extent of the home market to every part of the produce of every
different district of those countries. The great extent of Indostan too
rendered the home market of that country very great, and sufficient to
support a great variety of manufactures. But the small extent of ancient
 Egypt, which was never equal to England, must at all times have
rendered the home market of that country too narrow for supporting any
great variety of manufactures. Bengal, accordingly, the province of
Indostan which commonly exports the greatest quantity of rice, has
always been more remarkable for the exportation of a great variety of
manufactures, than for that of its grain. Ancient Egypt, on <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>181<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 the contrary, though it exported some manufactures, fine linen in
particular, as well as some other goods, was always most distinguished
for its great exportation of grain. It was long the granary of the Roman
 empire.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_477">The sovereigns of China, of ancient Egypt, and of the different<span class="type-margin"><span>The land tax gave eastern sovereigns a particular interest in agriculture.</span></span>
 kingdoms into which Indostan has at different times been divided, have
always derived the whole, or by far the most considerable part, of their
 revenue from some sort of land-tax or land-rent. This land-tax or
land-rent, like the tithe in Europe, consisted in a certain proportion, a
 fifth, it is said, of the produce of the land, which was either
delivered in kind, or paid in money, according to a certain valuation,
and which therefore varied from year to year according to all the
variations of the produce. It was natural therefore, that the sovereigns
 of those countries should be particularly attentive to the interests of
 agriculture, upon the prosperity or declension of which immediately
depended the yearly increase or diminution of their own revenue.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt336" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt336_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_478">The policy of the ancient republics of Greece, and that of Rome,<span class="type-margin"><span>Ancient
 Greece and Rome discouraged manufactures and foreign trade, and carried
 on manufactures only by slave labour, which is expensive</span></span>
though it honoured agriculture more than manufactures or foreign trade,
yet seems rather to have discouraged the latter employments, than to
have given any direct or intentional encouragement to the former. In
several of the ancient states of Greece, foreign trade was prohibited
altogether; and in several others the employments of artificers and
manufacturers were considered as hurtful to the strength and agility of
the human body, as rendering it incapable of those habits which their
military and gymnastic exercises endeavoured to form in it, and as
thereby disqualifying it more or less for<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt337" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt337_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 undergoing the fatigues and encountering the dangers of war. Such
occupations were considered as fit only for slaves, and the free
citizens of the state were prohibited from exercising them.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt338" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt338_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 Even in those states where no such prohibition took place, as in Rome
and Athens, the great body of the people were in effect excluded from
all the trades which are now commonly exercised by the lower sort of the
 inhabitants of towns. Such trades were, at Athens and Rome, all
occupied by the slaves of the rich, who exercised them for the benefit
of their masters, whose wealth, power, and protection, made it almost
impossible for a poor freeman to find a market for his work, when it
came into competition with that of the slaves of the rich. Slaves,
however, are very seldom inventive; and all the most important
improvements, either in machinery, or in the<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt339" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt339_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> arrangement and distribution of work, which facilitate and abridge labour, have been the discoveries of freemen. <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>182<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 Should a slave propose any improvement of this kind, his master would
be very apt to consider the proposal as the suggestion of laziness, and
of a desire to save his own labour at the master’s expence. The poor
slave, instead of reward, would probably meet with much abuse, perhaps
with some punishment. In the manufactures carried on by slaves,
therefore, more labour must generally have been employed to execute the
same quantity of work, than in those carried on by freemen. The work of
the former must, upon that account, generally have been dearer than that
 of the latter. The Hungarian mines, it is remarked by Mr. Montesquieu,
though not richer,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt340" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt340_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 have always been wrought with less expence, and therefore with more
profit, than the Turkish mines in their neighbourhood. The Turkish mines
 are wrought by slaves; and the arms of those slaves are the only
machines which the Turks have ever thought of employing. The Hungarian
mines are wrought by freemen, who employ a great deal of machinery, by
which they facilitate and abridge their own labour.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt341" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt341_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 From the very little that is known about the price of manufactures in
the times of the Greeks and Romans, it would appear that those of the
finer sort were excessively dear. Silk sold for its weight in gold. It
was not, indeed, in those times a European manufacture; and as it was
all brought from the East Indies, the distance of the carriage may in
some measure account for the greatness of the price. The price, however,
 which a lady, it is said, would sometimes pay for a piece of very fine
linen, seems to have been equally extravagant; and as linen was always
either a European, or, at farthest, an Egyptian manufacture, this high
price can be accounted for only by the great expence of the labour which
 must have been employed about it, and the expence of this labour again
could arise from nothing but the awkwardness of the machinery which it
made use of. The price of fine woollens too, though not quite so
extravagant, seems however to have been much above that of the present
times. Some cloths, we are told by Pliny, dyed in a particular manner,
cost a hundred denarii, or three pounds six shillings and eight pence
the pound weight.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt342" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt342_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 Others dyed in another manner cost a thousand denarii the pound weight,
 or thirty-three pounds six shillings and eight pence. The Roman pound,
it must be remembered, contained only twelve of our avoirdupois ounces.
This high price, indeed, seems to have been principally owing to the
dye. But had not the cloths themselves been much dearer than any which
are made in the present times, so very expensive a dye would not
probably have <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>183<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 been bestowed upon them. The disproportion would have been too great
between the value of the accessory and that of the principal. The price
mentioned by the same<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt343" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt343_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 author of some Triclinaria, a sort of woollen pillows or cushions made
use of to lean upon as they reclined upon their couches at table, passes
 all credibility; some of them being said to have cost more than thirty
thousand, others more than three hundred thousand pounds. This high
price too is not said to have arisen from the dye. In the dress of the
people of fashion of both sexes, there seems to have been much less
variety, it is observed by Dr. Arbuthnot, in ancient than in modern
times;<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt344" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt344_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 and the very little variety which we find in that of the ancient
statues confirms his observation. He infers from this, that their dress
must upon the whole have been cheaper than ours: but the conclusion does
 not seem to follow. When the expence of fashionable dress is very
great, the variety must be very small. But when, by the improvements in
the productive powers of manufacturing art and industry, the expence of
any one dress comes to be very moderate, the variety will naturally be
very great. The rich not being able to distinguish themselves by the
expence of any one dress, will naturally endeavour to do so by the
multitude and variety of their dresses.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_479">The greatest and most important branch of the commerce of<span class="type-margin"><span>Everything which raises the price of manufactures discourages agriculture,</span></span> every nation, it has already been observed,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt345" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt345_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 is that which is carried on between the inhabitants of the town and
those of the country. The inhabitants of the town draw from the country
the rude produce which constitutes both the materials of their work and
the fund of their subsistence; and they pay for this rude produce by
sending back to the country a certain portion of it manufactured and
prepared for immediate use. The trade which is carried on between those
two different sets of people, consists ultimately in a certain quantity
of rude produce exchanged for a certain quantity of manufactured
produce. The dearer the latter, therefore, the cheaper the former; and
whatever tends in any country to raise the price of manufactured
produce, tends to lower that of the rude produce of the land, and
thereby to discourage agriculture. The smaller the quantity of
manufactured produce which any given quantity of rude produce, or, what
comes to the same thing, which the price of any given quantity of rude
produce is capable of purchasing, the smaller the exchangeable value<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt346" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt346_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 of that given quantity of rude produce; the smaller the encouragement
which either the landlord has to increase its quantity by improving, or
the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>184<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 farmer by cultivating the land. Whatever, besides, tends to diminish in
 any country the number of artificers and manufacturers, tends to
diminish the home market, the most important of all markets for the rude
 produce of the land, and thereby still further to discourage
agriculture.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_480"><span class="type-margin"><span>and this is done by systems which restrain manufactures and foreign trade.</span></span>Those
 systems, therefore, which preferring agriculture to all other
employments, in order to promote it, impose restraints upon manufactures
 and foreign trade, act contrary to the very end which they propose, and
 indirectly discourage that very species of industry which they mean to
promote. They are so far, perhaps, more inconsistent than even the
mercantile system. That system, by encouraging manufactures and foreign
trade more than agriculture, turns a certain portion of the capital of
the society from supporting a more advantageous, to support a less
advantageous species of industry. But still it really and in the end
encourages that species of industry which it means to promote. Those
agricultural systems, on the contrary, really and in the end discourage
their own favourite species of industry.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_481"><span class="type-margin"><span>So all systems of encouragements and restraints retard the progress of society.</span></span>It
 is thus that every system which endeavours, either, by extraordinary
encouragements, to draw towards a particular species of industry a
greater share of the capital of the society than what would naturally go
 to it; or, by extraordinary restraints, to force from a particular
species of industry some share of the capital which would otherwise be
employed in it; is in reality subversive of the great purpose which it
means to promote. It retards, instead of accelerating, the progress of
the society towards real wealth and greatness; and diminishes, instead
of increasing, the real value of the annual produce of its land and
labour.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_482"><span class="type-margin"><span>The system of
natural liberty leaves the sovereign only three duties (1) the defence
of the country; (2) the administration of justice, and (3) the
maintenance of certain public works</span></span>All systems either of
preference or of restraint, therefore, being thus completely taken away,
 the obvious and simple system of natural liberty establishes itself of
its own accord. Every man, as long as he does not violate the laws of
justice, is left perfectly free to pursue his own interest his own way,
and to bring both his industry and capital into competition with those
of any other man, or order of men. The sovereign is completely
discharged from a duty, in the attempting to perform which he must
always be exposed to innumerable delusions, and for the proper
performance of which no human wisdom or knowledge could ever be
sufficient; the duty of superintending the industry of private people,
and of directing it towards the employments most suitable to the
interest of the society. According to the system of natural liberty, the
 sovereign has only three duties to attend to; three duties of great
importance, indeed, but plain and intelligible to common understandings:
 <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>185<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 first, the duty of protecting the society from the violence and
invasion of other independent societies; secondly, the duty of
protecting, as far as possible, every member of the society from the
injustice or oppression of every other member of it, or the duty of
establishing an exact administration of justice; and, thirdly, the duty
of erecting and maintaining certain public works and certain public
institutions, which it can never be for the interest of any individual,
or small number of individuals, to erect and maintain; because the
profit could never repay the expence to any individual or small number
of individuals, though it may frequently do much more than repay it to a
 great society.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_483">The proper performance of those several duties of the sovereign<span class="type-margin"><span>The
 next book will treat of the necessary expenses of the sovereign, the
methods of contribution towards the expenses of the whole society, and
the causes and effects of public debts</span></span> necessarily
supposes a certain expence; and this expence again necessarily requires a
 certain revenue to support it. In the following book, therefore, I
shall endeavour to explain; first, what are the necessary expences of
the sovereign or commonwealth; and which of those expences ought to be
defrayed by the general contribution of the whole society; and which of
them, by that of some particular part only, or of some particular
members of the society: secondly, what are the different methods in
which the whole society may be made to contribute towards defraying the
expences incumbent on the whole society, and what are the principal
advantages and inconveniences of each of those methods: and, thirdly,
what are the reasons and causes which have induced almost all modern
governments to mortgage some part of this revenue, or to contract debts,
 and what have been the effects of those debts upon the real wealth, the
 annual produce of the land and labour of the society. The following
book, therefore, will naturally be divided into three chapters.</p>

 well as according to other accidents. When its herds and flocks have
consumed the forage of one part of the country, it removes to another,
and from that to a third. In the dry season, it comes down to the banks
of the rivers; in the wet season it retires to the upper country. When
such a nation goes to war, the warriors will not trust their herds and
flocks to the feeble defence of their old men, their women and children,
 and their old men, their women and children, will not be left behind
without defence and without subsistence. The whole nation, besides,
being accustomed to a wandering life, even in time of peace, easily
takes the field in time of war. Whether it marches as an army, or moves
about as a company of herdsmen, the way of life is nearly the same,
though the object proposed by it be<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt348" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt348_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 very different. They all go to war together, therefore, and every one
does as well as he can. Among the Tartars, even the women have been
frequently known to engage in battle. If they conquer, whatever belongs
to the hostile tribe is the recompence of the victory. But if they are
vanquished, all is lost, and not only their herds and flocks, but their
women and children, become the booty of the conqueror. Even the greater
part of those who survive the action are obliged to submit to him for
the sake of immediate subsistence. The rest are commonly dissipated and
dispersed in the desart.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_487">The ordinary life, the ordinary exercises of a Tartar or Arab, prepare<span class="type-margin"><span>and the sovereign is at no expense</span></span>
 him sufficiently for war. Running, wrestling, cudgel-playing, throwing
the javelin, drawing the bow, &amp;c. are the common pastimes of those
who live in the open air, and are all of them the images of war. When a
Tartar or Arab actually goes to war, he is maintained, by his own herds
and flocks which he carries with him, in the same manner as in peace.
His chief or sovereign, for those nations have all chiefs or sovereigns,
 is at no sort of expence in preparing him for the field; and when he is
 in it, the chance of plunder is the only pay which he either expects or
 requires.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_488">An army of hunters can seldom exceed two or three hundred men.<span class="type-margin"><span>Shepherds are far more formidable than hunters.</span></span>
 The precarious subsistence which the chace affords could seldom allow a
 greater number to keep together for any considerable time. An army of
shepherds, on the contrary, may sometimes amount to two or three hundred
 thousand. As long as nothing stops their progress, as long as they can
go on from one district, of which they have consumed the forage, to
another which is yet entire; there seems to be scarce <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>188<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 any limit to the number who can march on together. A nation of hunters
can never be formidable to the civilized nations in their neighbourhood.
 A nation of shepherds may. Nothing can be more contemptible than an
Indian war in North America. Nothing, on the contrary, can be more
dreadful than a Tartar invasion has frequently been in Asia. The
judgment of Thucydides,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt349" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt349_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 that both Europe and Asia could not resist the Scythians united, has
been verified by the experience of all ages. The inhabitants of the
extensive, but defenceless plains of Scythia or Tartary, have been
frequently united under the dominion of the chief of some conquering
horde or clan; and the havoc and devastation of Asia have always
signalized their union. The inhabitants of the inhospitable desarts of
Arabia, the other great nation of shepherds, have never been united but
once; under Mahomet and his immediate successors.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt350" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt350_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 Their union, which was more the effect of religious enthusiasm than of
conquest, was signalized in the same manner. If the hunting nations of
America should ever become shepherds, their neighbourhood would be much
more dangerous to the European colonies than it is at present.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_489"><span class="type-margin"><span>Husbandmen
with little commerce and only household manufactures are easily
converted into soldiers, and it seldom costs the sovereign anything to
prepare them for the field,</span></span>In a yet more advanced state of
 society, among those nations of husbandmen who have little foreign
commerce, and no other manufactures but those coarse and houshold ones
which almost every private family prepares for its own use; every man,
in the same manner, either is a warrior, or easily becomes such. They
who live by agriculture generally pass the whole day in the open air,
exposed to all the inclemencies of the seasons. The hardiness of their
ordinary life prepares them for the fatigues of war, to some of which
their necessary occupations bear a great<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt351" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt351_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 analogy. The necessary occupation of a ditcher prepares him to work in
the trenches, and to fortify a camp as well as to enclose a field. The
ordinary pastimes of such husbandmen are the same as those of shepherds,
 and are in the same manner the images of war. But as husbandmen have
less leisure than shepherds, they are not so frequently employed in
those pastimes. They are soldiers, but soldiers not quite so much
masters of their exercise. Such as they are, however, it seldom costs
the sovereign or commonwealth any expence to prepare them for the field.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_490"><span class="type-margin"><span>or to maintain them when they have taken the field</span></span>Agriculture,
 even in its rudest and lowest state, supposes a settlement; some sort
of fixed habitation which cannot be abandoned without great loss. When a
 nation of mere husbandmen, therefore, goes to <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>189<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 war, the whole people cannot take the field together. The old men, the
women and children, at least, must remain at home to take care of the
habitation. All the men of the military age, however, may take the
field, and, in small nations of this kind, have frequently done so. In
every nation the men of the military age are supposed to amount to about
 a fourth or a fifth<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt352" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt352_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 part of the whole body of the people. If the campaign too should begin
after seed-time, and end before harvest, both the husbandman and his
principal labourers can be spared from the farm without much loss. He
trusts that the work which must be done in the mean time can be well
enough executed by the old men, the women and the children. He is not
unwilling, therefore, to serve without pay during a short<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt353" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt353_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 campaign, and it frequently costs the sovereign or commonwealth as
little to maintain him in the field as to prepare him for it. The
citizens of all the different states of ancient Greece seem to have
served in this manner till after the second Persian war; and the people
of Peloponesus till after the Peloponesian war. The Peloponesians,
Thucydides observes, generally left the field in the summer, and
returned home to reap the harvest.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt354" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt354_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> The Roman people under their kings, and during the first ages of the republic, served in the same manner.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt355" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt355_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 It was not till the siege of Veii, that they, who staid at home, began
to contribute something towards maintaining those who went to war.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt356" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt356_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a>
 In the European monarchies, which were founded upon the ruins of the
Roman empire, both before and for some time after the establishment of
what is properly called the feudal law, the great lords, with all their
immediate dependents, used to serve the crown at their own expence. In
the field, in the same manner as at home, they maintained themselves by
their own revenue, and not by any stipend or pay which they received
from the king upon that particular occasion.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_491">In a more advanced state of society, two different causes contribute<span class="type-margin"><span>Later it becomes necessary to pay those who take the field,</span></span>
 to render it altogether impossible that they who take the field, should
 maintain themselves at their own expence. Those two causes are, the
progress of manufactures, and the improvement in the art of war.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_492">Though a husbandman should be employed in an expedition, provided<span class="type-margin"><span>since artificers and manufacturers must be maintained by the public when away from their work,</span></span>
 it begins after seed-time and ends before harvest, the interruption of
his business will not always occasion any considerable diminution of his
 revenue. Without the intervention of his labour, nature does herself
the greater part of the work which remains to be done. But the moment
that an artificer, a smith, a carpenter, or a weaver, for example, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>190<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 quits his workhouse, the sole source of his revenue is completely dried
 up. Nature does nothing for him, he does all for himself. When he takes
 the field, therefore, in defence of the public, as he has no revenue to
 maintain himself, he must necessarily be maintained by the public. But
in a country of which a great part of the inhabitants are artificers and
 manufacturers, a great part of the people who go to war must be drawn
from those classes, and must therefore be maintained by the public as
long as they are employed in its service.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_493"><span class="type-margin"><span>and the greater length of campaigns makes service without pay too heavy a burden even for husbandmen</span></span>When
 the art of war too has gradually grown up to be a very intricate and
complicated science, when the event of war ceases to be determined, as
in the first ages of society, by a single irregular skirmish or battle,
but when the contest is generally spun out through several different
campaigns, each of which lasts during the greater part of the year; it
becomes universally necessary that the public should maintain those who
serve the public in war, at least while they are employed in that
service. Whatever in time of peace might be the ordinary occupation of
those who go to war, so very tedious and expensive a service would
otherwise be by far too heavy a burden upon them. After the second
Persian war, accordingly, the armies of Athens seem to have been
generally composed of mercenary troops; consisting, indeed, partly of
citizens, but partly too of foreigners; and all of them equally hired
and paid at the expence of the state. From the time of the siege of
Veii, the armies of Rome received pay for their service during the time
which they remained in the field.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt357" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt357_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Under the feudal governments the military service both of the great
lords and of their immediate dependents was, after a certain period,
universally exchanged for a payment in money, which was employed to
maintain those who served in their stead.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_494"><span class="type-margin"><span>The possible proportion of soldiers to the rest of the population is much smaller in civilised times.</span></span>The
 number of those who can go to war, in proportion to the whole number of
 the people, is necessarily much smaller in a civilized, than in a rude
state of society. In a civilized society, as the soldiers are maintained
 altogether by the labour of those who are not soldiers, the number of
the former can never<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt358" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt358_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 exceed what the latter can maintain, over and above maintaining, in a
manner suitable to their respective stations, both themselves and the
other officers of government, and law, whom they are obliged to
maintain. In the little agrarian states of ancient Greece, a fourth or a
 fifth part of the whole body of the people considered themselves as
soldiers, and would sometimes, it is said, take the field. Among the
civilized nations of modern Europe, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>191<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 it is commonly computed, that not more than one hundredth part of the
inhabitants of any country can be employed as soldiers, without ruin to
the country which pays the expence of their service.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt359" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt359_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_495">The expence of preparing the army for the field seems not to have<span class="type-margin"><span>The expense of preparing for the field was long inconsiderable.</span></span>
 become considerable in any nation, till long after that of maintaining
it in the field had devolved entirely upon the sovereign or
commonwealth. In all the different republics of ancient Greece, to learn
 his military exercises, was a necessary part of education imposed by
the state upon every free citizen. In every city there seems to have
been a public field, in which, under the protection of the public
magistrate, the young people were taught their different exercises by
different masters. In this very simple institution, consisted the whole
expence which any Grecian state seems ever to have been at, in preparing
 its citizens for war. In ancient Rome the exercises of the Campus
Martius answered the same purpose with those of the Gymnasium in ancient
 Greece. Under the feudal governments, the many public ordinances that
the citizens of every district should practise archery as well as
several other military exercises, were intended for promoting the same
purpose, but do not seem to have promoted it so well. Either from want
of interest in the officers entrusted with the execution of those
ordinances, or from some other cause, they appear to have been
universally neglected; and in the progress of all those governments,
military exercises seem to have gone gradually into disuse among the
great body of the people.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_496">In the republics of ancient Greece and Rome, during the whole<span class="type-margin"><span>Soldiers were not a distinct class in Greece and Rome, nor at first in feudal times.</span></span>
 period of their existence, and under the feudal governments for a
considerable time after their first establishment, the trade of a
soldier was not a separate, distinct trade, which constituted the sole
or principal occupation of a particular class of citizens. Every subject
 of the state, whatever might be the ordinary trade or occupation by
which he gained his livelihood, considered himself, upon all ordinary
occasions, as fit likewise to exercise the trade of a soldier, and upon
many extraordinary occasions as bound to exercise it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_497">The art of war, however, as it is certainly the noblest of all arts, so<span class="type-margin"><span>But as war becomes more complicated, division of labour becomes necessary to carry the art to perfection.</span></span>
 in the progress of improvement it necessarily becomes one of the most
complicated among them. The state of the mechanical, as well as of some
other arts, with which it is necessarily connected, determines the
degree of perfection to which it is capable of being carried at any
particular time. But in order to carry it to this degree of perfection,
it <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>192<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 is necessary that it should become the sole or principal occupation of a
 particular class of citizens, and the division of labour is as
necessary for the improvement of this, as of every other art. Into other
 arts the division of labour is naturally introduced by the prudence of
individuals, who find that they promote their private interest better by
 confining themselves to a particular trade, than by exercising a great
number. But it is the wisdom of the state only which can render the
trade of a soldier a particular trade separate and distinct from all
others. A private citizen who, in time of profound peace, and without
any particular encouragement from the public, should spend the greater
part of his time in military exercises, might, no doubt, both improve
himself very much in them, and amuse himself very well; but he certainly
 would not promote his own interest. It is the wisdom of the state only
which can render it for his interest to give up the greater part of his
time to this peculiar occupation: and states have not always had this
wisdom, even when their circumstances had become such, that the
preservation of their existence required that they should have it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_498"><span class="type-margin"><span>As society advances the people become unwarlike</span></span>A
 shepherd has a great deal of leisure; a husbandman, in the rude state
of husbandry, has some; an artificer or manufacturer has none at all.
The first may, without any loss, employ a great deal of his time in
martial exercises; the second may employ some part of it; but the last
cannot employ a single hour in them without some loss, and his attention
 to his own interest naturally leads him to neglect them altogether.
Those improvements in husbandry too, which the progress of arts and
manufactures necessarily introduces, leave the husbandman as little
leisure as the artificer. Military exercises come to be as much
neglected by the inhabitants of the country as by those of the town, and
 the great body of the people becomes altogether unwarlike. That wealth,
 at the same time, which always follows the improvements of agriculture
and manufactures, and which in reality is no more than the accumulated
produce of those improvements, provokes the invasion of all their
neighbours. An industrious, and upon that account a wealthy nation, is
of all nations the most likely to be attacked; and unless the state
takes some new measures for the public defence, the natural habits of
the people render them altogether incapable of defending themselves.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_499"><span class="type-margin"><span>There are only two methods of providing for defence,</span></span>In
 these circumstances, there seem to be but two methods, by which the
state can make any tolerable provision for the public defence.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_500">It may either, first, by means of a very
rigorous police, and in spite of the whole bent of the interest, genius
and inclinations of the people, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>193<span class="bracket">]</span></span> enforce the practice of military exercises, and oblige either all the<span class="type-margin"><span>(1) to enforce military exercises and service.</span></span>
 citizens of the military age, or a certain number of them, to join in
some measure the trade of a soldier to whatever other trade or
profession they may happen to carry on.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_501">Or, secondly, by maintaining and employing a certain number of<span class="type-margin"><span>or (2) to make the trade of the soldier a separate one:</span></span>
 citizens in the constant practice of military exercises, it may render
the trade of a soldier a particular trade, separate and distinct from
all others.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_502">If the state has recourse to the first of those two expedients, its<span class="type-margin"><span>in other words the establishment of a militia or a standing army.</span></span>
 military force is said to consist in a militia; if to the second, it is
 said to consist in a standing army. The practice of military exercises
is the sole or principal occupation of the soldiers of a standing army,
and the maintenance or pay which the state affords them is the principal
 and ordinary fund of their subsistence. The practice of military
exercises is only the occasional occupation of the soldiers of a
militia, and they derive the principal and ordinary fund of their
subsistence from some other occupation. In a militia, the character of
the labourer, artificer, or tradesman, predominates over that of the
soldier: in a standing army, that of the soldier predominates over every
 other character; and in this distinction seems to consist the essential
 difference between those two different species of military force.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_503">Militias have been of several different kinds. In some countries<span class="type-margin"><span>Militias were anciently only exercised and not regimented.</span></span>
 the citizens destined for defending the state, seem to have been
exercised only, without being, if I may say so, regimented; that is,
without being divided into separate and distinct bodies of troops, each
of which performed its exercises under its own proper and permanent
officers. In the republics of ancient Greece and Rome, each citizen, as
long as he remained at home, seems to have practised his exercises
either separately and independently, or with such of his equals as he
liked best; and not to have been attached to any particular body of
troops till he was actually called upon to take the field. In other
countries, the militia has not only been exercised, but regimented. In
England, in Switzerland, and, I believe, in every other country of
modern Europe, where any imperfect military force of this kind has been
established, every militia-man is, even in time of peace, attached to a
particular body of troops, which performs its exercises under its own
proper and permanent officers.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_504">Before the invention of fire-arms, that army was superior in which<span class="type-margin"><span>Fire-arms brought about the change by making dexterity less important,</span></span>
 the soldiers had, each individually, the greatest skill and dexterity
in the use of their arms. Strength and agility of body were of the
highest consequence, and commonly determined the fate of battles. But
this <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>194<span class="bracket">]</span></span> skill and dexterity in the use of their arms, could be acquired only, in the same manner as fencing is<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt360" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt360_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 at present, by practising, not in great bodies, but each man
scparately, in a particular school, under a particular master, or with
his own particular equals and companions. Since the invention of
fire-arms, strength and agility of body, or even extraordinary dexterity
 and skill in the use of arms, though they are far from being of no
consequence, are, however, of less consequences. The nature of the
weapon, though it by no means puts the awkward upon a level with the
skilful, puts him more nearly so than he ever was before. All the
dexterity and skill, it is supposed, which are necessary for using it,
can be well enough acquired by practising in great bodies.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_505"><span class="type-margin"><span>and discipline much more so</span></span>Regularity,
 order, and prompt obedience to command, are qualities which, in modern
armies, are of more importance towards determining the fate of battles,
than the dexterity and skill of the soldiers in the use of their arms.
But the noise of fire-arms, the smoke, and the invisible death to which
every man feels himself every moment exposed, as soon as he comes within
 cannon-shot, and frequently a long time before the battle can be well
said to be engaged, must render it very difficult to maintain any
considerable degree of this regularity, order, and prompt obedience,
even in the beginning of a modern battle. In an ancient battle there was
 no noise but what arose from the human voice; there was no smoke, there
 was no invisible cause of wounds or death. Every man, till some mortal
weapon actually did approach him, saw clearly that no such weapon was
near him. In these circumstances, and among troops who had some
confidence in their own skill and dexterity in the use of their arms, it
 must have been a good deal less difficult to preserve some degree of
regularity and order, not only in the beginning, but through the whole
progress of an ancient battle, and till one of the two armies was fairly
 defeated. But the habits of regularity, order, and prompt obedience to
command, can be acquired only by troops which are exercised in great
bodies.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_506"><span class="type-margin"><span>A militia is always inferior to a standing army,</span></span>A
 militia, however, in whatever manner it may be either disciplined or
exercised, must always be much inferior to a well-disciplined and
well-exercised standing army.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_507"><span class="type-margin"><span>being less expert,</span></span>The
 soldiers, who are exercised only once a week, or once a month, can
never be so expert in the use of their arms, as those who are exercised
every day, or every other day; and though this circumstance may not be
of so much consequence in modern, as it was in ancient times, yet the
acknowledged superiority of the Prussian troops, owing, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>195<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 it is said, very much to their superior expertness in their exercise,
may satisfy us that it is, even at this day, of very considerable
consequence.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_508">The soldiers, who are bound to obey their officer only once a week<span class="type-margin"><span>and less well disciplined.</span></span>
 or once a month, and who are at all other times at liberty to manage
their own affairs their own way, without being in any respect
accountable to him, can never be under the same awe in his presence, can
 never have the same disposition to ready obedience, with those whose
whole life and conduct are every day directed by him, and who every day
even rise and go to bed, or at least retire to their quarters, according
 to his orders. In what is called discipline, or in the habit of ready
obedience, a militia must always be still more inferior to a standing
army, than it may sometimes be in what is called the manual exercise, or
 in the management and use of its arms. But in modern war the habit of
ready and instant obedience is of much greater consequence than a
considerable superiority in the management of arms.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_509">Those militias which, like the Tartar or Arab militia, go to war<span class="type-margin"><span>The best militias are those which go to war under the chieftains who rule in time of peace</span></span>
 under the same chieftains whom they are accustomed to obey in peace,
are by far the best. In respect for their officers, in the habit of
ready obedience, they approach nearest to standing armies. The highland
militia, when it served under its own chieftains, had some advantage of
the same kind. As the highlanders, however, were not wandering, but
stationary shepherds, as they had all a fixed habitation, and were not,
in peaceable times, accustomed to follow their chieftain from place to
place; so in time of war they were less willing to follow him to any
considerable distance, or to continue for any long time in the field.
When they had acquired any booty they were eager to return home, and his
 authority was seldom sufficient to detain them. In point of obedience
they were always much inferior to what is reported of the Tartars and
Arabs. As the highlanders too, from their stationary life, spend less of
 their time in the open air, they were always less accustomed to
military exercises, and were less expert in the use of their arms than
the Tartars and Arabs are said to be.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_510">A militia of any kind, it must be observed, however, which has<span class="type-margin"><span>A militia kept long enough in the field becomes a standing army</span></span>
 served for several successive campaigns in the field, becomes in every
respect a standing army. The soldiers are every day exercised in the use
 of their arms, and, being constantly under the command of their
officers, are habituated to the same prompt obedience which takes place
in standing armies. What they were before they took the field, is of
little importance. They necessarily become in every respect a standing
army, after they have passed a few campaigns in it. Should <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>196<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the war in America drag out through another campaign,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt361" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt361_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> the American militia may become in every respect a match for that standing army, of which the valour appeared, in the last war,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt362" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt362_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> at least not inferior to that of the hardiest veterans of France and Spain.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_511"><span class="type-margin"><span>History shows the superiority of the standing army</span></span>This
 distinction being well understood, the history of all ages, it will be
found, bears testimony to the irresistible superiority which a
well-regulated standing army has over a militia.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_512"><span class="type-margin"><span>That of Macedon defeated the Greek militias</span></span>One
 of the first standing armies of which we have any distinct account, in
any well authenticated history, is that of Philip of Macedon. His
frequent wars with the Thracians, Illyrians, Thessalians, and some of
the Greek cities in the neighbourhood of Macedon, gradually formed his
troops, which in the beginning were probably militia, to the exact
discipline of a standing army. When he was at peace, which he was very
seldom, and never for any long time together, he was careful not to
disband that army. It vanquished and subdued, after a long and violent
struggle, indeed, the gallant and well exercised militias of the
principal republics of ancient Greece; and afterwards, with very little
struggle, the effeminate and ill-exercised militia of the great Persian
empire. The fall of the Greek republics and of the Persian empire, was
the effect of the irresistible superiority which a standing army has
over every sort of militia. It is the first great revolution in the
affairs of mankind, of which history has preserved any distinct or
circumstantial account.</p>

 fall of Carthage, and the consequent elevation of Rome, is the second.
All the varieties in the fortune of those two famous republics may very
well be accounted for from the same cause.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_514"><span class="type-margin"><span>The Carthaginian standing army defeated the Roman militia in Italy</span></span>From
 the end of the first to the beginning of the second Carthaginian war,
the armies of Carthage were continually in the field, and employed under
 three great generals, who succeeded one another in the command;
Amilcar, his son-in-law Asdrubal, and his son Annibal; first in
chastising their own rebellious slaves, afterwards in subduing the
revolted nations of Africa, and, lastly, in conquering the great kingdom
 of Spain. The army which Annibal led from Spain into Italy must
necessarily, in those different wars, have been gradually formed to the
exact discipline of a standing army. The Romans, in the mean time,
though they had not been altogether at peace, yet they had not, during
this period, been engaged in any war of very great consequence; and
their military discipline, it is generally said, was a good <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>197<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 deal relaxed. The Roman armies which Annibal encountered at Trebia.
Thrasymenus and Cannæ, were militia opposed to a standing army. This
circumstance, it is probable, contributed more than any other to
determine the fate of those battles.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_515">The standing army which Annibal left behind him in Spain, had the<span class="type-margin"><span>and Spain</span></span>
 like superiority over the militia which the Romans sent to oppose it,
and in a few years, under the command of his brother, the younger
Asdrubal, expelled them almost entirely from that country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_516">Annibal was ill supplied from home. The Roman militia, being<span class="type-margin"><span>When the Roman militias became a standing army they defeated the Carthaginian standing army in Italy</span></span>
 continually in the field, became in the progress of the war a well
disciplined and well exercised standing army; and the superiority of
Annibal grew every day less and less. Asdrubal judged it necessary to
lead the whole, or almost the whole of the standing army which he
commanded in Spain, to the assistance of his brother in Italy. In this<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt363" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt363_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 march he is said to have been misled by his guides; and in a country
which he did not know, was surprized and attacked by another standing
army, in every respect equal or superior to his own, and was entirely
defeated.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_517">When Asdrubal had left Spain, the great Scipio found nothing to<span class="type-margin"><span>and the Carthaginian militia in Spain, and both standing army and militia in Africa</span></span>
 oppose him but a militia inferior to his own. He conquered and subdued
that militia, and, in the course of the war, his own militia necessarily
 became a well-disciplined and well-exercised standing army. That
standing army was afterwards carried to Africa, where it found nothing
but a militia to oppose it. In order to defend Carthage it became
necessary to recall the standing army of Annibal. The disheartened and
frequently defeated African militia joined it, and, at the battle of
Zama, composed the greater part of the troops of Annibal. The event of
that day determined the fate of the two rival republics.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_518">From the end of the second Carthaginian war till the fall of the<span class="type-margin"><span>Thence forward the Roman republic had standing armies which found little resistance except from the standing army of Macedon</span></span>
 Roman republic, the armies of Rome were in every respect standing
armies. The standing army of Macedon made some resistance to their arms.
 In the height of their grandeur, it cost them two great wars, and three
 great battles, to subdue that little kingdom; of which the conquest
would probably have been still more difficult, had it not been for the
cowardice of its last king. The militias of all the civilized nations of
 the ancient world, of Greece, of Syria, and of Egypt, made but a feeble
 resistance to the standing armies of Rome. The militias of some
barbarous nations defended themselves much better. The Scythian or
Tartar militia, which Mithridates drew from the countries north of the
Euxine and Caspian seas, were the most formidable <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>198<span class="bracket">]</span></span> enemies whom<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt364" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt364_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 the Romans had to encounter after the second Carthaginian war. The
Parthian and German militias too were always respectable, and, upon
several occasions, gained very considerable advantages over the Roman
armies. In general, however, and when the Roman armies were well
commanded, they appear to have been very much superior; and if the
Romans did not pursue the final conquest either of Parthia or Germany,
it was probably because they judged, that it was not worth while to add
those two barbarous countries to an empire which was already too large.
The ancient Parthians appear to have been a nation of Scythian or Tartar
 extraction, and to have always retained a good deal of the manners of
their ancestors. The ancient Germans were, like the Scythians or
Tartars, a nation of wandering shepherds, who went to war under the same
 chiefs whom they were accustomed to follow in peace. Their militia was
exactly of the same kind with that of the Scythians or Tartars, from
whom too they were probably descended.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_519"><span class="type-margin"><span>Under the emperors these armies degenerated into militias.</span></span>Many
 different causes contributed to relax the discipline of the Roman
armies. Its extreme severity was, perhaps, one of those causes. In the
days of their grandeur, when no enemy appeared capable of opposing them,
 their heavy armour was laid aside as unnecessarily burdensome, their
laborious exercises were neglected as unnecessarily toilsome. Under the
Roman emperors besides, the standing armies of Rome, those particularly
which guarded the German and Pannonian frontiers, became dangerous to
their masters, against whom they used frequently to set up their own
generals. In order to render them less formidable, according to some
authors, Dioclesian, according to others, Constantine, first withdrew
them from the frontier, where they had always before been encamped in
great bodies, generally of two or three legions each, and dispersed them
 in small bodies through the different provincial towns, from whence
they were scarce ever removed, but when it became necessary to repel an
invasion. Small bodies of soldiers quartered in trading and
manufacturing towns, and seldom removed from those quarters, became
themselves tradesmen, artificers, and manufacturers. The civil came to
predominate over the military character; and the standing armies of Rome
 gradually degenerated into a corrupt, neglected, and undisciplined
militia, incapable of resisting the attack of the German and Scythian
militias, which soon afterwards invaded the western empire. It was only
by hiring the militia of some of those nations to oppose to that of
others, that the emperors were for some time able to defend themselves.
The fall of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>199<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 the western empire is the third great revolution in the affairs of
mankind, of which ancient history has preserved any distinct or
circumstantial account. It was brought about by the irresistible
superiority which the militia of a barbarous, has over that of a
civilized nation; which the militia of a nation of shepherds, has over
that of a nation of husbandmen, artificers, and manufacturers. The
victories which have been gained by militias have generally been, not
over standing armies, but over other militias in exercise and discipline
 inferior to themselves. Such were the victories which the Greek militia
 gained over that of the Persian empire; and such too were those which
in later times the Swiss militia gained over that of the Austrians and
Burgundians.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_520">The military force of the German and Scythian nations who established<span class="type-margin"><span>Militias were gradually superseded by standing armies in Western Europe</span></span>
 themselves upon the ruins of the western empire, continued for some
time to be of the same kind in their new settlements, as it had been in
their original country. It was a militia of shepherds and husbandmen,
which, in time of war, took the field under the command of the same
chieftains whom it was accustomed to obey in peace. It was, therefore,
tolerably well exercised, and tolerably well disciplined. As arts and
industry advanced, however, the authority of the chieftains gradually
decayed, and the great body of the people had less time to spare for
military exercises. Both the discipline and the exercise of the feudal
militia, therefore, went gradually to ruin, and standing armies were
gradually introduced to supply the place of it. When the expedient of a
standing army, besides, had once been adopted by one civilized nation,
it became necessary that all its neighbours should follow the example.
They soon found that their safety depended upon their doing so, and that
 their own militia was altogether incapable of resisting the attack of
such an army.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_521">The soldiers of a standing army, though they may never have seen<span class="type-margin"><span>A standing army does not lose its valour in time of peace,</span></span>
 an enemy, yet have frequently appeared to possess all the courage of
veteran troops, and the very moment that they took the field to have
been fit to face the hardiest and most experienced veterans. In 1756,
when the Russian army marched into Poland, the valour of the Russian
soldiers did not appear inferior to that of the Prussians, at that time
supposed to be the hardiest and most experienced veterans in Europe. The
 Russian empire, however, had enjoyed a profound peace for near twenty
years before, and could at that time have very few soldiers who had ever
 seen an enemy. When the Spanish war broke out in 1739, England had
enjoyed a profound peace for about eight and twenty years. The valour of
 her soldiers, however, far from being <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>200<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 corrupted by that long peace, was never more distinguished than in the
attempt upon Carthagena, the first unfortunate exploit of that
unfortunate war. In a long peace the generals, perhaps, may sometimes
forget their skill; but, where a well-regulated standing army has been
kept up, the soldiers seem never to forget their valour.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_522"><span class="type-margin"><span>and is the only safeguard of a civilised nation.</span></span>When
 a civilized nation depends for its defence upon a militia, it is at all
 times exposed to be conquered by any barbarous nation which happens to
be in its neighbourhood. The frequent conquests of all the civilized
countries in Asia by the Tartars, sufficiently demonstrates<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt365" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt365_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 the natural superiority, which the militia of a barbarous, has over
that of a civilized nation. A well-regulated standing army is superior
to every militia. Such an army, as it can best be maintained by an
opulent and civilized nation, so it can alone defend such a nation
against the invasion of a poor and barbarous neighbour. It is only by
means of a standing army, therefore, that the civilization of any
country can be perpetuated, or even preserved for any considerable time.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_523"><span class="type-margin"><span>also the only means of civilising a barbarous one</span></span>As
 it is only by means of a well-regulated standing army that a civilized
country can be defended; so it is only by means of it, that a barbarous
country can be suddenly and tolerably civilized. A standing army
establishes, with an irresistible force, the law of the sovereign
through the remotest provinces of the empire, and maintains some degree
of regular government in countries which could not otherwise admit of
any. Whoever examines, with attention, the improvements which Peter the
Great introduced into the Russian empire, will find that they almost all
 resolve themselves into the establishment of a well-regulated standing
army. It is the instrument which executes and maintains all his other
regulations. That degree of order and internal peace, which that empire
has ever since enjoyed, is altogether owing to the influence of that
army.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_524"><span class="type-margin"><span>It is not unfavourable to liberty</span></span>Men
 of republican principles have been jealous of a standing army as
dangerous to liberty. It certainly is so, wherever the interest of the
general and that of the principal officers are not necessarily connected
 with the support of the constitution of the state. The standing army of
 Cæsar destroyed the Roman republic. The standing army of Cromwel turned
 the long parliament out of doors.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt366" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt366_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 But where the sovereign is himself the general, and the principal
nobility and gentry of the country the chief officers of the army; where
 the military force is placed under the command of those who have the
greatest interest in the support of the civil authority, because they <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>201<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 have themselves the greatest share of that authority, a standing army
can never be dangerous to liberty. On the contrary, it may in some cases
 be favourable to liberty.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt367" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt367_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The security which it gives to the sovereign renders unnecessary that
troublesome jealousy, which, in some modern republics, seems to watch
over the minutest actions, and to be at all times ready to disturb the
peace of every citizen. Where the security of the magistrate, though
supported by the principal people of the country, is endangered by every
 popular discontent; where a small tumult is capable of bringing about
in a few hours a great revolution, the whole authority of government
must be employed to suppress and punish every murmur and complaint
against it. To a sovereign, on the contrary, who feels himself
supported, not only by the natural aristocracy of the country, but by a
well-regulated standing army, the rudest, the most groundless, and the
most licentious remonstrances can give little disturbance. He can safely
 pardon or neglect them, and his consciousness of his own superiority
naturally disposes him to do so. That degree of liberty which approaches
 to licentiousness can be tolerated only in countries where the
sovereign is secured by a well-regulated standing army. It is in such
countries only, that the public safety does not require, that the
sovereign should be trusted with any discretionary power, for
suppressing even the impertinent wantonness of this licentious liberty.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_525">The first duty of the sovereign, therefore, that of defending the<span class="type-margin"><span>Defence thus grows more expensive</span></span>
 society from the violence and injustice of other independent societies,
 grows gradually more and more expensive, as the society advances in
civilization. The military force of the society, which originally cost
the sovereign no expence either in time of peace or in time of war,
must, in the progress of improvement, first be maintained by him in time
 of war, and afterwards even in time of peace.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_526">The great change introduced into the art of war by the invention of<span class="type-margin"><span>Fire-arms enhance the expense,</span></span>
 fire-arms, has enhanced still further both the expence of exercising
and disciplining any particular number of soldiers in time of peace, and
 that of employing them in time of war. Both their arms and their
ammunition are become more expensive. A musquet is a more expensive
machine than a javelin or a bow and arrows; a cannon or a mortar than a
balista or a catapulta. The powder, which is spent in a modern review,
is lost irrecoverably, and occasions a very considerable expence. The
javelins and arrows which were thrown or shot in an ancient one, could
easily be picked up again, and were besides of very little value. The
cannon and the mortar are, not only much dearer, but much <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>202<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 heavier machines than the balista or catapulta, and require a greater
expence, not only to prepare them for the field, but to carry them to
it. As the superiority of the modern artillery too, over that of the
ancients is very great; it has become much more difficult, and
consequently much more expensive, to fortify a town so as to resist even
 for a few weeks the attack of that superior artillery. In modern times
many different causes contribute to render the defence of the society
more expensive. The unavoidable effects of the natural progress of
improvement have, in this respect, been a good deal enhanced by a great
revolution in the art of war, to which a mere accident, the invention of
 gunpowder, seems to have given occasion.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_527"><span class="type-margin"><span>and so give an advantage to rich nations, which is favourable to civilisation</span></span>In
 modern war the great expence of fire-arms gives an evident advantage to
 the nation which can best afford that expence; and consequently, to an
opulent and civilized, over a poor and barbarous nation. In ancient
times the opulent and civilized found it difficult to defend themselves
against the poor and barbarous nations. In modern times the poor and
barbarous find it difficult to defend themselves against the opulent and
 civilized. The invention of fire-arms, an invention which at first
sight appears to be so pernicious, is certainly favourable both to the
permanency and to the extension of civilization.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt368" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt368_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>

<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-02_528"><span class="type-margin"><span>The expense of justice is different at different periods</span></span>THE
 second duty of the sovereign, that of protecting, as far as possible,
every member of the society from the injustice or oppression of every
other member of it, or the duty of establishing an exact administration
of justice requires too very different degrees of expence in the
different periods of society.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_529"><span class="type-margin"><span>Civil government was first rendered necessary by the introduction of property</span></span>Among
 nations of hunters, as there is scarce any property, or at least none
that exceeds the value of two or three days labour; so there is seldom
any established magistrate or any regular administration of justice. Men
 who have no property can injure one another only in their persons or
reputations. But when one man kills, wounds, beats, or defames another,
though he to whom the injury is done suffers, he <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>203<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 who does it receives no benefit. It is otherwise with the injuries to
property. The benefit of the person who does the injury is often equal
to the loss of him who suffers it. Envy, malice, or resentment, are the
only passions which can prompt one man to injure another in his person
or reputation. But the greater part of men are not very frequently under
 the influence of those passions; and the very worst men are so only
occasionally. As their gratification too, how agreeable soever it may be
 to certain characters, is not attended with any real or permanent
advantage, it is in the greater part of men commonly restrained by
prudential considerations. Men may live together in society with some
tolerable degree of security, though there is no civil magistrate to
protect them from the injustice of those passions. But avarice and
ambition in the rich, in the poor the hatred of labour and the love of
present ease and enjoyment, are the passions which prompt to invade
property, passions much more steady in their operation, and much more
universal in their influence. Wherever there is great property, there is
 great inequality. For one very rich man, there must be at least five
hundred poor, and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the
 many. The affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor,
who are often both driven by want, and prompted by envy, to invade his
possessions. It is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that
the owner of that valuable property, which is acquired by the labour of
many years, or perhaps of many successive generations, can sleep a
single night in security. He is at all times surrounded by unknown
enemies, whom, though he never provoked, he can never appease, and from
whose injustice he can be protected only by the powerful arm of the
civil magistrate continually held up to chastise it. The acquisition of
valuable and<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt369" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt369_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 extensive property, therefore, necessarily requires the establishment
of civil government. Where there is no property, or at least none that
exceeds the value of two or three days labour, civil government is not
so necessary.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_530">Civil government supposes a certain subordination. But as the necessity<span class="type-margin"><span>Property strengthens the causes of subordination</span></span>
 of civil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable
 property, so the principal causes which naturally introduce
subordination gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable
property.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_531">The causes or circumstances which naturally introduce subordination,<span class="type-margin"><span>There are four causes of subordination.</span></span>
 or which naturally, and antecedent to any civil institution, give some
men some superiority over the greater part of their brethren, seem to be
 four in number.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>204<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_532"><span class="type-margin"><span>(1) superiority of personal qualifications,</span></span>The
 first of those causes or circumstances is the superiority of personal
qualifications, of strength, beauty, and agility of body; of wisdom, and
 virtue, of prudence, justice, fortitude, and moderation of mind. The
qualifications of the body, unless supported by those of the mind, can
give little authority in any period of society. He is a very strong man,
 who, by mere strength of body, can force two weak ones to obey him. The
 qualifications of the mind can alone give very great authority. They
are, however, invisible qualities; always disputable, and generally
disputed. No society, whether barbarous or civilized, has ever found it
convenient to settle the rules of precedency of rank and subordination,
according to those invisible qualities; but according to something that
is more plain and palpable.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_533"><span class="type-margin"><span>(2) superiority of age,</span></span>The
 second of those causes or circumstances is the superiority of age. An
old man, provided his age is not so far advanced as to give suspicion of
 dotage, is every where more respected than a young man of equal rank,
fortune, and abilities. Among nations of hunters, such as the native
tribes of North America, age is the sole foundation of rank and
precedency. Among them, father is the appellation of a superior;
brother, of an equal; and son, of an inferior. In the most opulent and
civilized nations, age regulates rank among those who are in every other
 respect equal, and among whom, therefore, there is nothing else to
regulate it. Among brothers and among sisters, the eldest always take
place; and in the succession of the paternal estate every thing which
cannot be divided, but must go entire to one person, such as a title of
honour, is in most cases given to the eldest. Age is a plain and
palpable quality which admits of no dispute.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_534"><span class="type-margin"><span>(3) superiority of fortune</span></span>The
 third of those causes or circumstances is the superiority of fortune.
The authority of riches, however, though great in every age of society,
is perhaps greatest in the rudest age of society which admits of any
considerable inequality of fortune. A Tartar chief, the increase of
whose herds and flocks is sufficient to maintain a thousand men, cannot
well employ that increase in any other way than in maintaining a
thousand men. The rude state of his society does not afford him any
manufactured produce, any trinkets or baubles of any kind, for which he
can exchange that part of his rude produce which is over and above his
own consumption. The thousand men whom he thus maintains, depending
entirely upon him for their subsistence, must both obey his orders in
war, and submit to his jurisdiction in peace. He is necessarily both
their general and their judge, and his chieftainship is the necessary
effect of the superiority of his fortune. In an opulent and civilized
society, a man may possess a much greater <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>205<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 fortune, and yet not be able to command a dozen of people. Though the
produce of his estate may be sufficient to maintain, and may perhaps
actually maintain, more than a thousand people, yet as those people pay
for every thing which they get from him, as he gives scarce any thing to
 any body but in exchange for an equivalent, there is scarce any body
who considers himself as entirely dependent upon him, and his authority
extends only over a few menial servants. The authority of fortune,
however, is very great even in an opulent and civilized society. That it
 is much greater than that, either of age, or of personal qualities, has
 been the constant complaint of every period of society which admitted
of any considerable inequality of fortune. The first period of society,
that of hunters, admits of no such inequality. Universal poverty
establishes there<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt370" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt370_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 universal equality, and the superiority, either of age, or of personal
qualities, are the feeble, but the sole foundations of authority and
subordination. There is therefore little or no authority or
subordination in this period of society. The second period of society,
that of shepherds, admits of very great inequalities of fortune, and
there is no period in which the superiority of fortune gives so great
authority to those who possess it. There is no period accordingly in
which authority and subordination are more perfectly established. The
authority of an Arabian scherif is very great; that of a Tartar khan
altogether despotical.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_535">The fourth of those causes or circumstances is the superiority of<span class="type-margin"><span>and (4) superiority of birth</span></span>
 birth. Superiority of birth supposes an ancient superiority of fortune
in the family of the person who claims it. All families are equally
ancient; and the ancestors of the prince, though they may be better
known, cannot well be more numerous than those of the beggar. Antiquity
of family means every where the antiquity either of wealth, or of that
greatness which is commonly either founded upon wealth, or accompanied
with it. Upstart greatness is every where less respected than ancient
greatness.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt371" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt371_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 The hatred of usurpers, the love of the family of an ancient monarch,
are, in a great measure, founded upon the contempt which men naturally
have for the former, and upon their veneration for the latter. As a
military officer submits without reluctance to the authority of a
superior by whom he has always been commanded, but cannot bear that his
inferior should be set over his head; so men easily submit to a family
to whom they and their ancestors have always submitted; but are fired
with indignation when another family, in whom they had never
acknowledged any such superiority, assumes a dominion over them.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>206<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_536"><span class="type-margin"><span>The distinction of birth is not present among hunters,</span></span>The
 distinction of birth, being subsequent to the inequality of fortune,
can have no place in nations of hunters, among whom all men, being equal
 in fortune, must likewise be very nearly equal in birth. The son of a
wise and brave man may, indeed, even among them, be somewhat more
respected than a man of equal merit who has the misfortune to be the son
 of a fool or a coward. The difference, however, will not be very great;
 and there never was, I believe, a great family in the world whose
illustration was entirely derived from the inheritance of wisdom and
virtue.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_537"><span class="type-margin"><span>but always among shepherds.</span></span>The
 distinction of birth not only may, but always does take place among
nations of shepherds. Such nations are always strangers to every sort of
 luxury, and great wealth can scarce ever be dissipated among them by
improvident profusion. There are no nations accordingly who abound more
in families revered and honoured on account of their descent from a long
 race of great and illustrious ancestors; because there are no nations
among whom wealth is likely to continue longer in the same families.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_538"><span class="type-margin"><span>Distinctions of birth and fortune are both most powerful among shepherds.</span></span>Birth
 and fortune are evidently the two circumstances which principally set
one man above another. They are the two great sources of personal
distinction, and are therefore the principal causes which naturally
establish authority and subordination among men. Among nations of
shepherds both those causes operate with their full force. The great
shepherd or herdsman, respected on account of his great wealth, and of
the great number of those who depend upon him for subsistence, and
revered on account of the nobleness of his birth, and of the immemorial
antiquity of his illustrious family, has a natural authority over all
the inferior shepherds or herdsmen of his horde or clan. He can command
the united force of a greater number of people than any of them. His
military power is greater than that of any of them. In time of war they
are all of them naturally disposed to muster themselves under his
banner, rather than under that of any other person, and his birth and
fortune thus naturally procure to him some sort of executive power. By
commanding too the united force of a greater number of people than any
of them, he is best able to compel any one of them who may have injured
another to compensate the wrong. He is the person, therefore, to whom
all those who are too weak to defend themselves naturally look up for
protection. It is to him that they naturally complain of the injuries
which they imagine have been done to them, and his interposition in such
 cases is more easily submitted to, even by the person complained of,
than that of any other person would be. His birth and fortune thus
naturally procure him some sort of judicial authority.</p>

<p id="Smith_0206-02_539">It is in the age of shepherds, in the second period of society, that<span class="type-margin"><span>Among shepherds inequality of fortune arises and introduces civil government,</span></span>
 the inequality of fortune first begins to take place, and introduces
among men a degree of authority and subordination which could not
possibly exist before. It thereby introduces some degree of that civil
government which is indispensably necessary for its own preservation:
and it seems to do this naturally, and even independent of the
consideration of that necessity. The consideration of that necessity
comes no doubt afterwards to contribute very much to maintain and secure
 that authority and subordination. The rich, in particular, are
necessarily interested to support that order of things, which can alone
secure them in the possession of their own advantages. Men of inferior
wealth combine to defend those of superior wealth in the possession of
their property, in order that men of superior wealth may combine to
defend them in the possession of theirs. All the inferior shepherds and
herdsmen feel that the security of their own herds and flocks depends
upon the security of those of the great shepherd or herdsman; that the
maintenance of their lesser authority depends upon that of his greater
authority, and that upon their subordination to him depends his power of
 keeping their inferiors in subordination to them. They constitute a
sort of little nobility, who feel themselves interested to defend the
property and to support the authority of their own little sovereign, in
order that he may be able to defend their property and to support their
authority. Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security
 of property, is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich
against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who
have none at all.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt372" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt372_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_540">The judicial authority of such a sovereign, however, far from being<span class="type-margin"><span>but the judicial authority was long a source of revenue rather than expense,</span></span>
 a cause of expence, was for a long time a source of revenue to him. The
 persons who applied to him for justice were always willing to pay for
it, and a present never failed to accompany a petition. After the
authority of the sovereign too was thoroughly established, the person
found guilty, over and above the satisfaction which he was obliged to
make to the party, was likewise forced to pay an amercement to the
sovereign. He had given trouble, he had disturbed, he had broke the
peace of his lord the king, and for those offences an amercement was
thought due. In the Tartar governments of Asia, in the governments of
Europe which were founded by the German and Scythian nations who
overturned the Roman empire, the administration of justice was a <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>208<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 considerable source of revenue, both to the sovereign, and to all the
lesser chiefs or lords who exercised under him any particular
jurisdiction, either over some particular tribe or clan, or over some
particular territory or district. Originally both the sovereign and the
inferior chiefs used to exercise this jurisdiction in their own persons.
 Afterwards they universally found it convenient to delegate it to some
substitute, bailiff, or judge. This substitute, however, was still
obliged to account to his principal or constituent for the profits of
the jurisdiction. Whoever reads the<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt373" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt373_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 instructions which were given to the judges of the circuit in the time
of Henry II. will see clearly that those judges were a sort of itinerant
 factors, sent round the country for the purpose of levying certain
branches of the king’s revenue. In those days the administration of
justice, not only afforded a certain revenue to the sovereign, but to
procure this revenue seems to have been one of the principal advantages
which he proposed to obtain by the administration of justice.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_541"><span class="type-margin"><span>which produced great abuses,</span></span>This
 scheme of making the administration of justice subservient to the
purposes of revenue, could scarce fail to be productive of several very
gross abuses. The person, who applied for justice with a large present
in his hand, was likely to get something more than justice; while he,
who applied for it with a small one, was likely to get something less.
Justice too might frequently be delayed, in order that this present
might be repeated. The amercement, besides, of the person complained of,
 might frequently suggest a very strong reason for finding him in the
wrong, even when he had not really been so. That such abuses were far
from being uncommon, the ancient history of every country in Europe
bears witness.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_542"><span class="type-margin"><span>whether the sovereign exercised the judicial authority in person or by deputy.</span></span>When
 the sovereign or chief exercised his judicial authority in his own
person, how much soever he might abuse it, it must have been scarce
possible to get any redress; because there could seldom be any body
powerful enough to call him to account. When he exercised it by a
bailiff, indeed, redress might sometimes be had. If it was for his own
benefit only, that the bailiff had been guilty of any act of injustice,
the sovereign himself might not always be unwilling to punish him, or to
 oblige him to repair the wrong. But if it was for the benefit of his
sovereign, if it was in order to make court to the person who appointed
him and who might prefer him, that he had committed any act of
oppression, redress would upon most occasions be as impossible <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>209<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 as if the sovereign had committed it himself. In all barbarous
governments, accordingly, in all those ancient governments of Europe in
particular, which were founded upon the ruins of the Roman empire, the
administration of justice appears for a long time to have been extremely
 corrupt; far from being quite equal and impartial even under the best
monarchs, and altogether profligate under the worst.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_543">Among nations of shepherds, where the sovereign or chief is only<span class="type-margin"><span>These abuses could not be remedied so long as the sovereign depended only on land revenue and court fees,</span></span>
 the greatest shepherd or herdsman of the horde or clan, he is
maintained in the same manner as any of his vassals or subjects, by the
increase of his own herds or flocks. Among those nations of husbandmen
who are but just come out of the shepherd state, and who are not much
advanced beyond that state; such as the Greek tribes appear to have been
 about the time of the Trojan war, and our German and Scythian ancestors
 when they first settled upon the ruins of the western empire; the
sovereign or chief is, in the same manner, only the greatest landlord of
 the country, and is maintained, in the same manner as any other
landlord, by a revenue derived from his own private estate, or from
what, in modern Europe, was called the demesne of the crown. His
subjects, upon ordinary occasions, contribute nothing to his support,
except when, in order to protect them from the oppression of some of
their fellow-subjects, they stand in need of his authority.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt374" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt374_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The presents which they make him upon such occasions, constitute the
whole ordinary revenue, the whole of the emoluments which, except
perhaps upon some very extraordinary emergencies, he derives from his
dominion over them. When Agamemnon, in Homer, offers to Achilles for his
 friendship the sovereignty of seven Greek cities, the sole advantage
which he mentions as likely to be derived from it, was, that the people
would honour him with presents.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt375" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt375_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 As long as such presents, as long as the emoluments of justice, or what
 may be called the fees of court, constituted in this manner the whole
ordinary revenue which the sovereign derived from his sovereignty, it
could not well be expected, it could not even decently be proposed, that
 he should give them up altogether. It might, and it frequently was
proposed, that he should regulate and ascertain them. But after they had
 been so regulated and ascertained, how to hinder a person who was
all-powerful from extending them beyond those regulations, was still
very difficult, not to say impossible. During the continuance of this
state of things, therefore, the corruption of justice, naturally <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>210<span class="bracket">]</span></span> resulting from the arbitrary and uncertain nature of those presents, scarce admitted of any effectual remedy.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_544"><span class="type-margin"><span>but when taxes became necessary, the people stipulated that no presents should be taken by judges.</span></span>But
 when from different causes, chiefly from the continually increasing
expence of defending the nation against the invasion of other nations,
the private estate of the sovereign had become altogether insufficient
for defraying the expence of the sovereignty; and when it had become
necessary that the people should, for their own security, contribute
towards this expence by taxes of different kinds, it seems to have been
very commonly stipulated, that no present for the administration of
justice should, under any pretence, be accepted either by the sovereign,
 or by his bailiffs and substitutes, the judges. Those presents, it
seems to have been supposed, could more easily be abolished altogether,
than effectually regulated and ascertained. Fixed salaries were
appointed to the judges, which were supposed to compensate to them the
loss of whatever might have been their share of the ancient emoluments
of justice; as the taxes more than compensated to the sovereign the loss
 of his. Justice was then said to be administered gratis.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_545"><span class="type-margin"><span>Justice is never administered gratis.</span></span>Justice,
 however, never was in reality administered gratis in any country.
Lawyers and attornies, at least, must always be paid by the parties;
and, if they were not, they would perform their duty still worse than
they actually perform it. The fees annually paid to lawyers and
attornies amount, in every court, to a much greater sum than the
salaries of the judges. The circumstance of those salaries being paid by
 the crown, can no-where much diminish the necessary expence of a
law-suit. But it was not so much to diminish the expence, as to prevent
the corruption of justice, that the judges were prohibited from
receiving any present or fee from the parties.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_546"><span class="type-margin"><span>The salaries of judges are a small part of the expense of civilised government,</span></span>The
 office of judge is in itself so very honourable, that men are willing
to accept of it, though accompanied with very small emoluments. The
inferior office of justice of peace, though attended with a good deal of
 trouble, and in most cases with no emoluments at all, is an object of
ambition to the greater part of our country gentlemen. The salaries of
all the different judges, high and low, together with the whole expence
of the administration and execution of justice, even where it is not
managed with very good œconomy, makes, in any civilized country, but a
very inconsiderable part of the whole expence of government.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_547"><span class="type-margin"><span>and might be defrayed by fees of court</span></span>The
 whole expence of justice too might easily be defrayed by the fees of
court; and, without exposing the administration of justice to any real
hazard of corruption, the public revenue might thus be entirely
discharged from a certain, though, perhaps, but a small incumbrance. <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>211<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 It is difficult to regulate the fees of court effectually, where a
person so powerful as the sovereign is to share in them, and to derive
any considerable part of his revenue from them. It is very easy, where
the judge is the principal person who can reap any benefit from them.
The law can very easily oblige the judge to respect the regulation,
though it might not always be able to make the sovereign respect it.
Where the fees of court are precisely regulated and ascertained, where
they are paid all at once, at a certain period of every process, into
the hands of a cashier or receiver, to be by him distributed in certain
known proportions among the different judges after the process is
decided, and not till it is decided, there seems to be no more danger of
 corruption than where such fees are prohibited altogether. Those fees,
without occasioning any considerable increase in the expence of a
law-suit, might be rendered fully sufficient for defraying the whole
expence of justice. By not being paid to the judges till the process was
 determined, they might be some incitement to the diligence of the court
 in examining and deciding it. In courts which consisted of a
considerable number of judges, by proportioning the share of each judge
to the number of hours and days which he had employed in examining the
process, either in the court or in a committee by order of the court,
those fees might give some encouragement to the diligence of each
particular judge. Public services are never better performed than when
their reward comes only in consequence of their being performed, and is
proportioned to the diligence employed in performing them. In the
different parliaments of France, the fees of court (called Epicès<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt376" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt376_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 and vacations) constitute the far greater part of the emoluments of the
 judges. After all deductions are made, the neat salary paid by the
crown to a counsellor or judge in the parliament of Toulouse, in rank
and dignity the second parliament of the kingdom, amounts only to a
hundred and fifty livres, about six pounds eleven shillings sterling a
year. About seven years ago<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt377" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt377_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 that sum was in the same place the ordinary yearly wages of a common
footman. The distribution of those Epicès too is according to the
diligence of the judges. A diligent judge gains a comfortable, though
moderate, revenue by his office: An idle one gets little more than his
salary. Those parliaments are perhaps, in many respects, not very
convenient courts of justice; but they have never been accused; they
seem never even to have been suspected of corruption.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>212<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_548"><span class="type-margin"><span>The English courts were originally maintained by fees, and this led to their encroachments</span></span>The
 fees of court seem originally to have been the principal support of the
 different courts of justice in England. Each court endeavoured to draw
to itself as much business as it could, and was, upon that account,
willing to take cognizance of many suits which were not originally
intended to fall under its jurisdiction. The court of king’s bench,
instituted for the trial of criminal causes only, took cognizance of
civil suits; the plaintiff pretending that the defendant, in not doing
him justice, had been guilty of some trespass or misdemeanor. The court
of exchequer, instituted for the levying of the king’s revenue, and for
enforcing the payment of such debts only as were due to the king, took
cognizance of all other contract debts; the plaintiff alleging that he
could not pay the king, because the defendant would not pay him. In
consequence of such fictions it came, in many cases, to depend
altogether upon the parties before what court they would chuse to have
their cause tried; and each court endeavoured, by superior dispatch and
impartiality, to draw to itself as many causes as it could. The present
admirable constitution of the courts of justice in England was, perhaps,
 originally in a great measure, formed by this emulation, which
anciently took place between their respective judges; each judge
endeavouring to give, in his own court, the speediest and most effectual
 remedy, which the law would admit, for every sort of injustice.
Originally the courts of law gave damages only for breach of contract.
The court of chancery, as a court of conscience, first took upon it to
enforce the specific performance of agreements. When the breach of
contract consisted in the non-payment of money, the damage sustained
could be compensated in no other way than by ordering payment, which was
 equivalent to a specific performance of the agreement. In such cases,
therefore, the remedy of the courts of law was sufficient. It was not so
 in others. When the tenant sued his lord for having unjustly outed him
of his lease, the damages which he recovered were by no means equivalent
 to the possession of the land. Such causes, therefore, for some time,
went all to the court of chancery, to the no small loss of the courts of
 law. It was to draw back such causes to themselves that the courts of
law are said to have invented the artificial and fictitious writ of
ejectment, the most effectual remedy for an unjust outer or
dispossession of land.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt378" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt378_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_549"><span class="type-margin"><span>Courts might be maintained by a stamp duty on proceedings before them, but this would tempt them to multiply such proceedings.</span></span>A
 stamp-duty upon the law proceedings of each particular court, to be
levied by that court, and applied towards the maintenance of the judges
and other officers belonging to it, might, in the same manner, afford a
revenue sufficient for defraying the expence of the administration <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>213<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of justice, without bringing any burden upon the general revenue of the
 society. The judges indeed might, in this case, be under the temptation
 of multiplying unnecessarily the proceedings upon every cause, in order
 to increase, as much as possible, the produce of such a stamp-duty. It
has been the custom in modern Europe to regulate, upon most occasions,
the payment of the attornies and clerks of court, according to the
number of pages which they had occasion to write; the court, however,
requiring that each page should contain so many lines, and each line so
many words. In order to increase their payment, the attornies and clerks
 have contrived to multiply words beyond all necessity, to the
corruption of the law language of, I believe, every court of justice in
Europe. A like temptation might perhaps occasion a like corruption in
the form of law proceedings.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_550">But whether the administration of justice be so contrived as to<span class="type-margin"><span>Another way of securing independence would be to endow the courts with a revenue from property</span></span>
 defray its own expence, or whether the judges be maintained by fixed
salaries paid to them from some other fund, it does not seem necessary
that the person or persons entrusted with the executive power should be
charged with the management of that fund, or with the payment of those
salaries. That fund might arise from the rent of landed estates, the
management of each estate being entrusted to the particular court which
was to be maintained by it. That fund might arise even from the interest
 of a sum of money, the lending out of which might, in the same manner,
be entrusted to the court which was to be maintained by it. A part,
though indeed but a small part, of the salary of the judges of the court
 of session in Scotland, arises from the interest of a sum of money. The
 necessary instability of such a fund seems, however, to render it an
improper one for the maintenance of an institution which ought to last
for ever.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_551">The separation of the judicial from the executive power seems<span class="type-margin"><span>The separation of the judicial from the executive power is due to the increase of executive business.</span></span>
 originally to have arisen from the increasing business of the society,
in consequence of its increasing improvement. The administration of
justice became so laborious and so complicated a duty as to require the
undivided attention of the persons to whom it was entrusted. The person
entrusted with the executive power, not having leisure to attend to the
decision of private causes himself, a deputy was appointed to decide
them in his stead. In the progress of the Roman greatness, the consul
was too much occupied with the political affairs of the state, to attend
 to the administration of justice. A prætor, therefore, was appointed to
 administer it in his stead. In the progress of the European monarchies
which were founded upon the ruins of the Roman empire, the sovereigns
and the great lords came universally <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>214<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 to consider the administration of justice as an office, both too
laborious and too ignoble for them to execute in their own persons. They
 universally, therefore, discharged themselves of it by appointing a
deputy, bailiff, or judge.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_552"><span class="type-margin"><span>The judicial should be not only separate but independent of the executive power</span></span>When
 the judicial is united to the executive power, it is scarce possible
that justice should not frequently be sacrificed to, what is vulgarly
called, politics. The persons entrusted with the great interests of the
state may, even without any corrupt views, sometimes imagine it
necessary to sacrifice to those interests the rights of a private man.
But upon the impartial administration of justice depends the liberty of
every individual, the sense which he has of his own security. In order
to make every individual feel himself perfectly secure in the possession
 of every right which belongs to him, it is not only necessary that the
judicial should be separated from the executive power, but that it
should be rendered as much as possible independent of that power. The
judge should not be liable to be removed from his office according to
the caprice of that power. The regular payment of his salary should not
depend upon the good-will, or even upon the good œconomy of that power.</p>

 third duty of the sovereign is the erection and maintenance of those
public works and institutions which are useful but not capable of
bringing in a profit to individuals.</span></span>THE third and last
duty of the sovereign or commonwealth is that of erecting and
maintaining those public institutions and those public works, which,
though they may be in the highest degree advantageous to a great
society, are, however, of such a nature, that the profit could never
repay the expence to any individual or small number of individuals, and
which it therefore cannot be expected that any individual or small
number of individuals should erect or maintain. The performance of this
duty requires too very different degrees of expence in the different
periods of society.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_554"><span class="type-margin"><span>These are chiefly institutions for facilitating commerce and promoting instruction.</span></span>After
 the public institutions and public works necessary for the defence of
the society, and for the administration of justice, both of which have
already been mentioned, the other works and institutions of this kind
are chiefly those for facilitating the commerce of the society, and
those for promoting the instruction of the people. The institutions for
instruction are of two kinds; those for the education of the youth, and
those for the instruction of people of all ages. The consideration of
the manner in which the expence of those different <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>215<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 sorts of public works and institutions may be most properly defrayed,
will divide this third part of the present chapter into three different
articles.</p>
<div id="lf0206-02_div_022" class="type-section">
<h2 id="lf0206-02_label_437"><span class="csc">Article</span> I: <span class="ital">Of the public Works and Institutions for facilitating the Commerce of the Society</span> <br>
<span class="subhead"><span class="ital">And, first, of those which are necessary for facilitating Commerce in general</span><a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt379" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt379_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></span></h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-02_555">THAT the erection and maintenance of the public works which<span class="type-margin"><span>The expense of such institutions increases.</span></span>
 facilitate the commerce of any country, such as good roads, bridges,
navigable canals, harbours, &amp;c. must require very different degrees
of expence in the different periods of society, is evident without any
proof. The expence of making and maintaining the public roads of any
country must evidently increase with the annual produce of the land and
labour of that country, or with the quantity and weight of the goods
which it becomes necessary to fetch and carry upon those roads. The
strength of a bridge must be suited to the number and weight of the
carriages, which are likely to pass over it. The depth and the supply of
 water for a navigable canal must be proportioned to the number and
tunnage of the lighters, which are likely to carry goods upon it; the
extent of a harbour to the number of the shipping which are likely to
take shelter in it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_556">It does not seem necessary that the expence of those public works<span class="type-margin"><span>The expense need not be defrayed from the general public revenue,</span></span> should be defrayed from that public revenue, as it is commonly called, of which the collection and application are<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt380" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt380_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 in most countries assigned to the executive power. The greater part of
such public works may easily be so managed, as to afford a particular
revenue sufficient for defraying their own expence, without bringing any
 burden upon the general revenue of the society.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_557">A highway, a bridge, a navigable canal, for example, may in most<span class="type-margin"><span>but may be raised by tolls and other particular charges</span></span>
 cases be both made and maintained by a small toll upon the carriages
which make use of them: a harbour, by a moderate port-duty upon the
tunnage of the shipping which load or unload in it. The coinage, another
 institution for facilitating commerce, in many countries, not only
defrays its own expence, but affords a small revenue or seignorage to
the sovereign. The post-office, another institution for the same
purpose, over and above defraying its own expence, affords in almost all
 countries a very considerable revenue to the sovereign.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>216<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_558"><span class="type-margin"><span>Tolls according to weight of carriages and capacity of boats are very equitable</span></span>When
 the carriages which pass over a highway or a bridge, and the lighters
which sail upon a navigable canal, pay toll in proportion to their
weight or their tunnage, they pay for the maintenance of those public
works exactly in proportion to the wear and tear<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt381" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt381_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 which they occasion of them. It seems scarce possible to invent a more
equitable way of maintaining such works. This tax or toll too, though it
 is advanced by the carrier, is finally paid by the consumer, to whom it
 must always be charged in the price of the goods. As the expence of
carriage, however, is very much reduced by means of such public works,
the goods, notwithstanding the toll, come cheaper to the consumer than
they could otherwise have done; their price not being so much raised by
the toll, as it is lowered by the cheapness of the carriage. The person
who finally pays this tax, therefore, gains by the application, more
than he loses by the payment of it. His payment is exactly in proportion
 to his gain. It is in reality no more than a part of that gain which he
 is obliged to give up in order to get the rest. It seems impossible to
imagine a more equitable method of raising a tax.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_559"><span class="type-margin"><span>If the tolls are higher on carriages of luxury, the rich contribute in an easy manner to the relief of the poor</span></span>When
 the toll upon carriages of luxury, upon coaches, post-chaises, &amp;c.
is made somewhat higher in proportion to their weight, than upon
carriages of necessary use, such as carts, waggons, &amp;c. the
indolence and vanity of the rich is made to contribute in a very easy
manner to the relief of the poor, by rendering cheaper the
transportation of heavy goods to all the different parts of the country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_560"><span class="type-margin"><span>Roads and canals, etc., thus paid for cannot be made except where they are wanted</span></span>When
 high roads, bridges, canals, &amp;c. are in this manner made and
supported by the commerce which is carried on by means of them, they can
 be made only where that commerce requires them, and consequently where
it is proper to make them. Their expence too, their grandeur and
magnificence, must be suited to what that commerce can afford to pay.
They must be made consequently as it is proper to make them. A
magnificent high road cannot be made through a desart country where
there is little or no commerce, or merely because it happens to lead to
the country villa of the intendant of the province, or to that of some
great lord to whom the intendant finds it convenient to make his court. A
 great bridge cannot be thrown over a river at a place where nobody
passes, or merely to embellish the view from the windows of a
neighbouring palace: things which sometimes happen, in countries where
works of this kind are carried on by any other revenue than that which
they themselves are capable of affording.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_561"><span class="type-margin"><span>Canals are better in the hands of private persons than of commissioners.</span></span>In
 several different parts of Europe the toll or lock-duty upon a canal is
 the property of private persons, whose private interest obliges them <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>217<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 to keep up the canal. If it is not kept in tolerable order, the
navigation necessarily ceases altogether, and along with it the whole
profit which they can make by the tolls. If those tolls were put under
the management of commissioners, who had themselves no interest in them,
 they might be less attentive to the maintenance of the works which
produced them. The canal of Languedoc cost the king of France and the
province upwards of thirteen millions of livres, which (at twenty-eight
livres the mark of silver, the value of French money in the end of the
last century) amounted to upwards of nine hundred thousand pounds
sterling. When that great work was finished, the most likely method, it
was found, of keeping it in constant repair was to make a present of the
 tolls to Riquet the engineer, who planned and conducted the work. Those
 tolls constitute at present a very large estate to the different
branches of the family of that gentleman, who have, therefore, a great
interest to keep the work in constant repair. But had those tolls been
put under the management of commissioners, who had no such interest,
they might perhaps have been dissipated in ornamental and unnecessary
expences, while the most essential parts of the work were allowed to go
to ruin.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_562">The tolls for the maintenance of a high road, cannot with any safety<span class="type-margin"><span>But tolls on a high road cannot safely be made private property and must be committed to trustees</span></span>
 be made the property of private persons. A high road, though entirely
neglected, does not become altogether impassable, though a canal does.
The proprietors of the tolls upon a high road, therefore, might neglect
altogether the repair of the road, and yet continue to levy very nearly
the same tolls. It is proper, therefore, that the tolls for the
maintenance of such work should be put under the management of
commissioners or trustees.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_563">In Great Britain, the abuses which the trustees have committed in<span class="type-margin"><span>The prevalence of complaints against British turnpike tolls is not remarkable</span></span>
 the management of those tolls, have in many cases been very justly
complained of. At many turnpikes, it has been said, the money levied is
more than double of what is necessary for executing, in the completest
manner, the work which is often executed in a very slovenly manner, and
sometimes not executed at all. The system of repairing the high roads by
 tolls of this kind, it must be observed, is not of very long standing.
We should not wonder, therefore, if it has not yet been brought to that
degree of perfection of which it seems capable.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt382" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt382_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 If mean and improper persons are frequently appointed trustees; and if
proper courts of inspection and account have not yet been established
for controlling their conduct, and for reducing the tolls to what is
barely sufficient for executing the work to be done by them; the recency
 <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>218<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of the institution both accounts and apologizes for those defects, of
which, by the wisdom of parliament, the greater part may in due time be
gradually remedied.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_564"><span class="type-margin"><span>It has been proposed that the government should manage the turnpikes and make a revenue from them.</span></span>The
 money levied at the different turnpikes in Great Britain is supposed to
 exceed so much what is necessary for repairing the roads, that the
savings, which, with proper œconomy, might be made from it, have been
considered, even by some ministers, as a very great resource which might
 at some time or another be applied to the exigencies of the state.
Government, it has been said, by taking the management of the turnpikes
into its own hands, and by employing the soldiers, who would work for a
very small addition to their pay, could keep the roads in good order at a
 much less expence than it can be done by trustees, who have no other
workmen to employ, but such as derive their whole subsistence from their
 wages. A great revenue, half a million, perhaps,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt383" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt383_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 it has been pretended, might in this manner be gained without laying
any new burden upon the people; and the turnpike roads might be made to
contribute to the general expence of the state, in the same manner as
the post-office does at present.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_565"><span class="type-margin"><span>This plan is open to the following objections.</span></span>That
 a considerable revenue might be gained in this manner, I have no doubt,
 though probably not near so much, as the projectors of this plan have
supposed. The plan itself, however, seems liable to several very
important objections.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_566"><span class="type-margin"><span>(1) the tolls would be raised and become a great encumbrance to commerce.</span></span>First,
 if the tolls which are levied at the turnpikes should ever be
considered as one of the resources for supplying the exigencies of the
state, they would certainly be augmented as those exigencies were
supposed to require. According to the policy of Great Britain,
therefore, they would probably be augmented very fast. The facility with
 which a great revenue could be drawn from them, would probably
encourage administration to recur very frequently to this resource.
Though it may, perhaps, be more than doubtful, whether half a million
could by any œconomy be saved out of the present tolls, it can scarce be
 doubted but that a million might be saved out of them, if they were
doubled; and perhaps two millions, if they were tripled.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt384" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt384_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 This great revenue too might be levied without the appointment of a
single new officer to collect and receive it. But the turnpike tolls
being continually augmented in this manner, instead of facilitating the
inland <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>219<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 commerce of the country, as at present, would soon become a very great
incumbrance upon it. The expence of transporting all heavy goods from
one part of the country to another would soon be so much increased, the
market for all such goods, consequently, would soon be so much narrowed,
 that their production would be in a great measure discouraged, and the
most important branches of the domestic industry of the country
annihilated altogether.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_567">Secondly, a tax upon carriages in proportion to their weight, though<span class="type-margin"><span>(2) a tax on carriages in proportion to weight falls principally on the poor,</span></span>
 a very equal tax when applied to the sole purpose of repairing the
roads, is a very unequal one, when applied to any other purpose, or to
supply the common exigencies of the state. When it is applied to the
sole purpose above mentioned, each carriage is supposed to pay exactly
for the wear and tear<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt385" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt385_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 which that carriage occasions of the roads. But when it is applied to
any other purpose, each carriage is supposed to pay for more than that
wear and tear, and contributes to the supply of some other exigency of
the state. But as the turnpike toll raises the price of goods in
proportion to their weight, and not to their value, it is chiefly paid
by the consumers of coarse and bulky, not by those of precious and light
 commodities. Whatever exigency of the state therefore this tax might be
 intended to supply, that exigency would be chiefly supplied at the
expence of the poor, not of the rich; at the expence of those who are
least able to supply it, not of those who are most able.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_568">Thirdly, if government should at any time neglect the reparation of<span class="type-margin"><span>and (3) the roads would beneglected.</span></span>
 the high roads, it would be still more difficult, than it is at
present, to compel the proper application of any part of the turnpike
tolls. A large revenue might thus be levied upon the people, without any
 part of it being applied to the only purpose to which a revenue levied
in this manner ought ever to be applied. If the meanness and poverty of
the trustees of turnpike roads render it sometimes difficult at present
to oblige them to repair their wrong; their wealth and greatness would
render it ten times more so in the case which is here supposed.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_569">In France, the funds destined for the reparation of the high roads<span class="type-margin"><span>High roads are under the executive in France,</span></span> are under the immediate direction of the executive power. Those funds consist, partly in a certain number of days labour<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt386" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt386_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 which the country people are in most parts of Europe obliged to give to
 the reparation of the highways; and partly in such a portion of the
general revenue of the state as the king chuses to spare from his other
expences.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>220<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_570"><span class="type-margin"><span>and great post roads are generally good, but all the rest entirely neglected.</span></span>By the ancient law of France, as well as by that of most other parts of Europe, the labour of the country people<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt387" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt387_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 was under the direction of a local or provincial magistracy, which had
no immediate dependency upon the king’s council. But by the present
practice both the labour of the country people, and whatever other fund
the king may chuse to assign for the reparation of the high roads in any
 particular province or generality, are entirely under the management of
 the intendant; an officer who is appointed and removed by the king’s
council, who receives his orders from it, and is in constant
correspondence with it. In the progress of despotism the authority of
the executive power gradually absorbs that of every other power in the
state, and assumes to itself the management of every branch of revenue
which is destined for any public purpose. In France, however, the great
post-roads, the roads which make the communication between the principal
 towns of the kingdom, are in general kept in good order; and in some
provinces are even a good deal superior to the greater part of the
turnpike roads of England. But what we call the cross-roads, that is,
the far greater part of the roads in the country, are entirely
neglected, and are in many places absolutely impassable for any heavy
carriage. In some places it is even dangerous to travel on horseback,
and mules are the only conveyance which can safely be trusted. The proud
 minister of an ostentatious court may frequently take pleasure in
executing a work of splendour and magnificence, such as a great highway,
 which is frequently seen by the principal nobility, whose applauses not
 only flatter his vanity, but even contribute to support his interest at
 court. But to execute a great number of little works, in which nothing
that can be done can make any great appearance, or excite the smallest
degree of admiration in any traveller, and which, in short, have nothing
 to recommend them but their extreme utility, is a business which
appears in every respect too mean and paultry to merit the attention of
so great a magistrate. Under such an administration, therefore, such
works are almost always entirely neglected.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_571"><span class="type-margin"><span>The executive
in China and other parts of Asia maintains both high roads and canals,
it is said, in good condition, but this would not be the case in Europe</span></span>In
 China, and in several other governments of Asia, the executive power
charges itself both with the reparation of the high roads, and with the
maintenance of the navigable canals. In the instructions which are given
 to the governor of each province, those objects, it is said, are
constantly recommended to him, and the judgment which the court forms of
 his conduct is very much regulated by the attention which he appears to
 have paid to this part of his instructions. This <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>221<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 branch of public police accordingly is said to be very much attended to
 in all those countries, but particularly in China, where the high
roads, and still more the navigable canals, it is pretended, exceed very
 much every thing of the same kind which is known in Europe. The
accounts of those works, however, which have been transmitted to Europe,
 have generally been drawn up by weak and wondering travellers;
frequently by stupid and lying missionaries. If they had been examined
by more intelligent eyes, and if the accounts of them had been reported
by more faithful witnesses, they would not, perhaps, appear to be so
wonderful. The account which Bernier gives of some works of this kind in
 Indostan, falls very much short of what had been reported of them by
other travellers, more disposed to the marvellous than he was.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt388" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt388_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 It may too, perhaps, be in those countries, as it is in France, where
the great roads, the great communications which are likely to be the
subjects of conversation at the court and in the capital, are attended
to, and all the rest neglected. In China, besides, in Indostan, and in
several other governments of Asia, the revenue of the sovereign arises
almost altogether from a land-tax or land-rent, which rises or falls
with the rise and<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt389" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt389_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 fall of the annual produce of the land. The great interest of the
sovereign, therefore, his revenue, is in such countries necessarily and
immediately connected with the cultivation of the land, with the
greatness of its produce, and with the value of its produce. But in
order to render that produce both as great and as valuable as possible,
it is necessary to procure to it as extensive a market as possible, and
consequently to establish the freest, the easiest, and the least
expensive communication between all the different parts of the country;
which can be done only by means of the best roads and the best navigable
 canals. But the revenue of the sovereign does not, in any part of
Europe, arise chiefly from a land-tax or land-rent. In all the great
kingdoms of Europe, perhaps, the greater part of it may ultimately
depend upon the produce of the land: But that dependency is neither so
immediate, nor so evident. In Europe, therefore, the sovereign does not
feel himself so directly called upon to promote the increase, both in
quantity and value, of the produce of the land, or, by maintaining good
roads and canals, to provide the most extensive market for that produce.
 Though it should be true, therefore, what I apprehend is not a little
doubtful, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>222<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 that in some parts of Asia this department of the public police is very
 properly managed by the executive power, there is not the least
probability that, during the present state of things, it could be
tolerably managed by that power in any part of Europe.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_572"><span class="type-margin"><span>Public works of a local nature should be maintained by local revenue</span></span>Even
 those public works which are of such a nature that they cannot afford
any revenue for maintaining themselves, but of which the conveniency is
nearly confined to some particular place or district, are always better
maintained by a local or provincial revenue, under the management of a
local and provincial administration, than by the general revenue of the
state, of which the executive power must always have the management.
Were the streets of London to be lighted and paved at the expence of the
 treasury, is there any probability that they would be so well lighted
and paved as they are at present, or even at so small an expence? The
expence, besides, instead of being raised by a local tax upon the
inhabitants of each particular street, parish, or district in London,
would, in this case, be defrayed out of the general revenue of the
state, and would consequently be raised by a tax upon all the
inhabitants of the kingdom, of whom the greater part derive no sort of
benefit from the lighting and paving of the streets of London.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_573"><span class="type-margin"><span>The abuses of local administration are small compared with those of the administration of the general revenue</span></span>The
 abuses which sometimes creep into the local and provincial
administration of a local and provincial revenue, how enormous soever
they may appear, are in reality, however, almost always very trifling,
in comparison of those which commonly take place in the administration
and expenditure of the revenue of a great empire. They are, besides,
much more easily corrected. Under the local or provincial administration
 of the justices of the peace in Great Britain, the six days labour
which the country people are obliged to give to the reparation of the
highways, is not always perhaps very judiciously applied, but it is
scarce ever exacted with any circumstance of cruelty or oppression. In
France, under the administration of the intendants, the application is
not always more judicious, and the exaction is frequently the most cruel
 and oppressive. Such Corvées, as they are called, make one of the
principal instruments of tyranny by which those officers chastise any
parish or communeauté which has had the misfortune to fall under their
displeasure.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt390" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt390_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>

<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-02_574">THE object of the public works and institutions above mentioned<span class="type-margin"><span>Some
 particular institutions are required to facilitate particular branches
of commerce, as trade with barbarous nations requires forts, and trade
with other nations requires ambassadors</span></span> is to facilitate
commerce in general. But in order to facilitate some particular branches
 of it, particular institutions are necessary, which again require a
particular and extraordinary expence.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_575">Some particular branches of commerce, which
are carried on with barbarous and uncivilized nations, require
extraordinary protection. An ordinary store or counting-house could give
 little security to the goods of the merchants who trade to the western
coast of Africa. To defend them from the barbarous natives, it is
necessary that the place where they are deposited, should be, in some
measure, fortified. The disorders in the government of Indostan have
been supposed to render a like precaution necessary even among that mild
 and gentle people; and it was under pretence of securing their persons
and property from violence, that both the English and French East India
Companies were allowed to erect the first forts which they possessed in
that country. Among other nations, whose vigorous government will suffer
 no strangers to possess any fortified place within their territory, it
may be necessary to maintain some ambassador, minister, or consul, who
may both decide, according to their own customs, the differences arising
 among his own countrymen; and, in their disputes with the natives, may,
 by means of his public character, interfere with more authority, and
afford them a more powerful protection, than they could expect from any
private man. The interests of commerce have frequently made it necessary
 to maintain ministers in foreign countries, where the purposes, either
of war or alliance, would not have required any. The commerce of the
Turkey Company first occasioned the establishment of an ordinary
ambassador at Constantinople.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt392" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt392_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> The first English embassies to Russia arose altogether from commercial interests.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt393" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt393_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 The constant interference which those interests necessarily occasioned
between the subjects of the different states of Europe, has probably
introduced the custom of keeping, in all neighbouring countries,
ambassadors or ministers constantly resident even in the time of peace.
This custom, unknown to ancient times, seems not to be older than the
end of the fifteenth or beginning of the sixteenth century; that is,
than the time when commerce first began to extend itself to the greater
part of the nations of Europe, and when they first began to attend to
its interests.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>224<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_576"><span class="type-margin"><span>Branches of commerce which require extraordinary expense for their protection may reasonably bear a particular tax</span></span>It
 seems not unreasonable, that the extraordinary expence, which the
protection of any particular branch of commerce may occasion, should be
defrayed by a moderate tax upon that particular branch; by a moderate
fine, for example, to be paid by the traders when they first enter into
it, or, what is more equal, by a particular duty of so much per cent.
upon the goods which they either import into, or export out of, the
particular countries with which it is carried on. The protection of
trade in general, from pirates and free-booters, is said to have given
occasion to the first institution of the duties of customs. But, if it
was thought reasonable to lay a general tax upon trade, in order to
defray the expence of protecting trade in general, it should seem
equally reasonable to lay a particular tax upon a particular branch of
trade, in order to defray the extraordinary expence of protecting that
branch.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_577"><span class="type-margin"><span>The proceeds of such taxes should be at the disposal of the executive, but have often been given to companies of merchants,</span></span>The
 protection of trade in general has always been considered as essential
to the defence of the commonwealth, and, upon that account, a necessary
part of the duty of the executive power. The collection and application
of the general duties of customs, therefore, have always been left to
that power. But the protection of any particular branch of trade is a
part of the general protection of trade; a part, therefore, of the duty
of that power; and if nations always acted consistently, the particular
duties levied for the purposes of such particular protection, should
always have been left equally to its disposal. But in this respect, as
well as in many others, nations have not always acted consistently; and
in the greater part of the commercial states of Europe, particular
companies of merchants have had the address to persuade the legislature
to entrust to them the performance of this part of the duty of the
sovereign, together with all the powers which are necessarily connected
with it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_578"><span class="type-margin"><span>which have always proved in the long run burdensome or useless</span></span>These
 companies, though they may, perhaps, have been useful for the first
introduction of some branches of commerce, by making, at their own
expence, an experiment which the state might not think it prudent to
make, have in the long-run proved, universally, either burdensome or
useless, and have either mismanaged or confined the trade.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_579"><span class="type-margin"><span>They are either regulated or joint-stock companies.</span></span>When
 those companies do not trade upon a joint stock, but are obliged to
admit any person, properly qualified, upon paying a certain fine, and
agreeing to submit to the regulations of the company, each member
trading upon his own stock, and at his own risk, they are called
regulated companies. When they trade upon a joint stock, each member
sharing in the common profit or loss in proportion to <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>225<span class="bracket">]</span></span> his share in this stock, they are called joint stock companies.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt394" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt394_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> Such companies, whether regulated or joint stock, sometimes have, and sometimes have not, exclusive privileges.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_580">Regulated companies resemble, in every respect, the corporations of<span class="type-margin"><span>Regulated companies are like corporations of trades and act like them</span></span>
 trades, so common in the cities and towns of all the different
countries of Europe; and are a sort of enlarged monopolies of the same
kind. As no inhabitant of a town can exercise an incorporated trade,
without first obtaining his freedom in the corporation, so in most cases
 no subject of the state can lawfully carry on any branch of foreign
trade, for which a regulated company is established, without first
becoming a member of that company. The monopoly is more or less strict
according as the terms of admission are more or less difficult; and
according as the directors of the company have more or less authority,
or have it more or less in their power to manage in such a manner as to
confine the greater part of the trade to themselves and their particular
 friends. In the most ancient regulated companies the privileges of
apprenticeship were the same as in other corporations; and entitled the
person who had served his time to a member of the company, to become
himself a member, either without paying any fine, or upon paying a much
smaller one than what was exacted of other people. The usual corporation
 spirit, wherever the law does not restrain it, prevails in all
regulated companies. When they have been allowed to act according to
their natural genius, they have always, in order to confine the
competition to as small a number of persons as possible, endeavoured to
subject the trade to many burdensome regulations. When the law has
restrained them from doing this, they have become altogether useless and
 insignificant.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_581">The regulated companies for foreign commerce, which at present<span class="type-margin"><span>There are five existing regulated companies,</span></span> subsist in Great Britain, are, the ancient merchant adventurers company,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt395" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt395_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> now commonly called the Hamburgh Company, the Russia<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt396" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt396_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> Company, the Eastland Company, the Turkey Company, and the African Company.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_582">The terms of admission into the Hamburgh Company, are now said<span class="type-margin"><span>of which the Hamburg, Russian and Eastland Companies are merely useless</span></span> to be quite easy; and the directors either have it not in their power to subject the trade to any burdensome restraint<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt397" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt397_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> or regulations, or, at least, have not of late exercised that power. It has not always been <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>226<span class="bracket">]</span></span> so. About the middle of the last century, the fine for admission was fifty, and at one time one hundred pounds,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt398" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt398_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 and the conduct of the company was said to be extremely oppressive. In
1643, in 1645, and in 1661, the clothiers and free traders of the West
of England complained of them to parliament, as of monopolists who
confined the trade and oppressed the manufactures of the country.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt399" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt399_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 Though those complaints produced no act of parliament, they had
probably intimidated the company so far, as to oblige them to reform
their conduct. Since that time, at least, there have<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt400" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt400_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> been no complaints against them. By the 10th and 11th of William III. c. 6.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt401" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt401_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 the fine for admission into the Russian Company was reduced to five
pounds; and by the 25th of Charles II. c. 7. that for admission into the
 Eastland Company, to forty shillings, while, at the same time, Sweden,
Denmark and Norway, all the countries on the north side of the Baltic,
were exempted from their exclusive charter.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt402" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt402_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a>
 The conduct of those companies had probably given occasion to those two
 acts of parliament. Before that time, Sir Josiah Child had represented
both these and the Hamburgh Company as extremely oppressive, and imputed
 to their bad management the low state of the trade, which we at that
time carried on to the countries comprehended within their respective
charters.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt403" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt403_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">6</a>
 But though such companies may not, in the present times, be very
oppressive, they are certainly altogether useless. To be merely useless,
 indeed, is perhaps the highest eulogy which can ever justly be bestowed
 upon a regulated company; and all the three companies above mentioned
seem, in their present state, to deserve this eulogy.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_583"><span class="type-margin"><span>The Turkey Company is an oppressive monopoly</span></span>The
 fine for admission into the Turkey Company, was formerly twenty-five
pounds for all persons under twenty-six years of age, and fifty pounds
for all persons above that age. Nobody but mere merchants could be
admitted; a restriction which excluded all shop-keepers and retailers.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt404" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt404_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">7</a>
 By a bye-law, no British manufactures could be exported to Turkey but
in the general ships of the company; and as those ships sailed always
from the port of London, this restriction confined the trade to that
expensive<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt405" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt405_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">8</a> port, and the traders, to those who lived in <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>227<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 London and in its neighbourhood. By another bye-law, no person living
within twenty miles of London, and not free of the city, could be
admitted a member; another restriction, which, joined to the foregoing,
necessarily excluded all but the freemen of London.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt406" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt406_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 As the time for the loading and sailing of those general ships depended
 altogether upon the directors, they could easily fill them with their
own goods and those of their particular friends, to the exclusion of
others, who, they might pretend, had made their proposals too late. In
this state of things, therefore, this company was in every respect a
strict and oppressive monopoly. Those abuses gave occasion to the act of
 the 26th of George II. c. 18. reducing the fine for admission to twenty
 pounds for all persons, without any distinction of ages, or any
restriction, either to mere merchants, or to the freemen of London; and
granting to all such persons the liberty of exporting, from all the
ports of Great Britain to any port in Turkey, all British goods of which
 the exportation was not prohibited; and of importing from thence all
Turkish goods, of which the importation was not prohibited, upon paying
both the general duties of customs, and the particular duties assessed
for defraying the necessary expences of the company; and submitting, at
the same time, to the lawful authority of the British ambassador and
consuls resident in Turkey, and to the bye-laws of the company duly
enacted. To prevent any oppression by those bye-laws, it was by the same
 act ordained, that if any seven members of the company conceived
themselves aggrieved by any bye-law which should be enacted after the
passing of this act, they might appeal to the Board of Trade and
Plantations (to the authority of which, a committee of the privy council
 has now succeeded), provided such appeal was brought within twelve
months after the bye-law was enacted; and that if any seven members
conceived themselves aggrieved by any bye-law which had been enacted
before the passing of this act, they might bring a like appeal, provided
 it was within twelve months after the day on which this act was to take
 place. The experience of one year, however, may not always be
sufficient to discover to all the members of a great company the
pernicious tendency of a particular bye-law; and if several of them
should afterwards discover it, neither the Board of Trade, nor the
committee of council, can afford them any redress. The object, besides,
of the greater part of the bye-laws of all regulated companies, as well
as of all other corporations, is not so much to oppress those who are
already members, as to discourage others from becoming so; which may be
done, not only by a high fine, but <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>228<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 by many other contrivances. The constant view of such companies is
always to raise the rate of their own profit as high as they can; to
keep the market, both for the goods which they export, and for those
which they import, as much understocked as they can: which can be done
only by restraining the competition, or by discouraging new adventurers
from entering into the trade. A fine even of twenty pounds, besides,
though it may not, perhaps, be sufficient to discourage any man from
entering into the Turkey trade, with an intention to continue in it, may
 be enough to discourage a speculative merchant from hazarding a single
adventure in it. In all trades, the regular established traders, even
though not incorporated, naturally combine to raise profits, which are
no-way so likely to be kept, at all times, down to their proper level,
as by the occasional competition of speculative adventurers. The Turkey
trade, though in some measure laid open by this act of parliament, is
still considered by many people as very far from being altogether free.
The Turkey Company contribute to maintain an ambassador and two or three
 consuls, who, like other public ministers, ought to be maintained
altogether by the state, and the trade laid open to all his majesty’s
subjects. The different taxes levied by the company, for this and other
corporation purposes, might afford a revenue much more than sufficient
to enable the state to maintain such ministers.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_584"><span class="type-margin"><span>Regulated companies are more unfit to maintain forts than joint-stock companies,</span></span>Regulated
 companies, it was observed by Sir Josiah Child, though they had
frequently supported public ministers, had never maintained any forts or
 garrisons in the countries to which they traded; whereas joint stock
companies frequently had.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt407" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt407_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 And in reality the former seem to be much more unfit for this sort of
service than the latter. First, the directors of a regulated company
have no particular interest in the prosperity of the general trade of
the company, for the sake of which, such forts and garrisons are
maintained. The decay of that general trade may even frequently
contribute to the advantage of their own private trade; as by
diminishing the number of their competitors, it may enable them both to
buy cheaper, and to sell dearer. The directors of a joint stock company,
 on the contrary, having only their share in the profits which are made
upon the common stock committed to their management, have no private
trade of their own, of which the interest can be separated from that of
the general trade of the company. Their private interest is connected
with the prosperity of the general trade of the company; and with the
maintenance of the forts and garrisons which are necessary for its
defence. They are more <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>229<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 likely, therefore, to have that continual and careful attention which
that maintenance necessarily requires. Secondly, The directors of a
joint stock company have always the management of a large capital, the
joint stock of the company, a part of which they may frequently employ,
with propriety, in building, repairing, and maintaining such necessary
forts and garrisons. But the directors of a regulated company, having
the management of no common capital, have no other fund to employ in
this way, but the casual revenue arising from the admission fines, and
from the corporation duties, imposed upon the trade of the company.
Though they had the same interest, therefore, to attend to the
maintenance of such forts and garrisons, they can seldom have the same
ability to render that attention effectual. The maintenance of a public
minister requiring scarce any attention, and but a moderate and limited
expence, is a business much more suitable both to the temper and
abilities of a regulated company.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_585">Long after the time of Sir Josiah Child, however, in 1750, a regulated<span class="type-margin"><span>but the African company was charged with this duty</span></span>
 company was established, the present company of merchants trading to
Africa, which was expressly charged at first with the maintenance of all
 the British forts and garrisons that lie between Cape Blanc and the
Cape of Good Hope, and afterwards with that of those only which lie
between Cape Rouge and the Cape of Good Hope. The act which establishes
this company (the 23d of George II. c. 31.) seems to have had two
distinct objects in view; first, to restrain effectually the oppressive
and monopolizing spirit which is natural to the directors of a regulated
 company; and secondly, to force them, as much as possible, to give an
attention, which is not natural to them, towards the maintenance of
forts and garrisons.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt408" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt408_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_586">For the first of these purposes, the fine for admission is limited to<span class="type-margin"><span>The statute establishing the company endeavoured ineffectually to restrain the spirit of monopoly,</span></span>
 forty shillings. The company is prohibited from trading in their
corporate capacity, or upon a joint stock; from borrowing money upon
common seal, or from laying any restraints upon the trade which may be
carried on freely from all places, and by all persons being British
subjects, and paying the fine. The government is in a committee of nine
persons who meet at London, but who are chosen annually by the freemen
of the company at London, Bristol and Liverpool; three from each place.
No committee-man can be continued in office for more than three years
together. Any committee-man might be removed by the Board of Trade and
Plantations; now by a committee of council, after being heard in his own
 defence. The committee are forbid to export negroes from Africa, or to
import any African goods <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>230<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 into Great Britain. But as they are charged with the maintenance of
forts and garrisons, they may, for that purpose, export from Great
Britain to Africa, goods and stores of different kinds. Out of the
monies which they shall receive from the company, they are allowed a sum
 not exceeding eight hundred pounds for the salaries of their clerks and
 agents at London, Bristol and Liverpool, the house-rent of their office
 at London, and all other<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt409" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt409_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 expences of management, commission and agency in England. What remains
of this sum, after defraying these different expences, they may divide
among themselves, as compensation for their trouble, in what manner they
 think proper. By this constitution, it might have been expected, that
the spirit of monopoly would have been effectually restrained, and the
first of these purposes sufficiently answered. It would seem, however,
that it had not. Though by the 4th of George III. c. 20. the fort of
Senegal, with all its dependencies, had been vested in the company of
merchants trading to Africa, yet in the year following (by the 5th of
George III. c. 44.) not only Senegal and its dependencies, but the whole
 coast from the port of Sallee, in south Barbary, to Cape Rouge, was
exempted from the jurisdiction of that company, was vested in the crown,
 and the trade to it declared free to all his majesty’s subjects. The
company had been suspected of restraining the trade, and of establishing
 some sort of improper monopoly. It is not, however, very easy to
conceive how, under the regulations of the 23d George II. they could do
so. In the printed debates of the House of Commons, not always the most
authentic records of truth, I observe, however, that they have been
accused of this. The members of the committee of nine being all
merchants, and the governors and factors in their different forts and
settlements being all dependent upon them, it is not unlikely that the
latter might have given peculiar attention to the consignments and
commissions of the former, which would establish a real monopoly.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_587"><span class="type-margin"><span>and Parliament allots £ 13,000 a year to the company for forts, which sum they misapply.</span></span>For
 the second of these purposes, the maintenance of the forts and
garrisons, an annual sum has been allotted to them by parliament,
generally about 13,000 <span class="ital">l.</span> For the proper
application of this sum, the committee is obliged to account annually to
 the Cursitor Baron of Exchequer; which account is afterwards to be laid
 before parliament. But parliament, which gives so little attention to
the application of millions, is not likely to give much to that of
13,000 <span class="ital">l.</span> a-year; and the Cursitor Baron of
Exchequer, from his profession and education, is not likely to be
profoundly skilled in the proper expence of forts and <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>231<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 garrisons. The captains of his majesty’s navy, indeed, or any other
commissioned officers, appointed by the Board of Admiralty, may enquire
into the condition of the forts and garrisons, and report their
observations to that board. But that board seems to have no direct
jurisdiction over the committee, nor any authority to correct those
whose conduct it may thus enquire into; and the captains of his
majesty’s navy, besides, are not supposed to be always deeply learned in
 the science of fortification. Removal from an office, which can be
enjoyed only for the term of three years, and of which the lawful
emoluments, even during that term, are so very small, seems to be the
utmost punishment to which any committee-man is liable, for any fault,
except direct malversation, or embezzlement, either of the public money,
 or of that of the company; and the fear of that punishment can never be
 a motive of sufficient weight to force a continual and careful
attention to a business, to which he has no other interest to attend.
The committee are accused of having sent out bricks and stones from
England for the reparation of Cape Coast Castle on the coast of Guinea, a
 business for which parliament had several times granted an
extraordinary sum of money. These bricks and stones too, which had thus
been sent upon so long a voyage, were said to have been of so bad a
quality, that it was necessary to rebuild from the foundation the walls
which had been repaired with them. The forts and garrisons which lie
north of Cape Rouge, are not only maintained at the expence of the
state, but are under the immediate government of the executive power;
and why those which lie south of that Cape, and which too are, in part
at least, maintained at the expence of the state, should be under a
different government, it seems not very easy even to imagine a good
reason. The protection of the Mediterranean trade was the original
purpose or pretence of the garrisons of Gibraltar and Minorca, and the
maintenance and government of those garrisons has always been, very
properly, committed, not to the Turkey Company, but to the executive
power. In the extent of its dominion consists, in a great measure, the
pride and dignity of that power; and it is not very likely to fail in
attention to what is necessary for the defence of that dominion. The
garrisons at Gibraltar and Minorca, accordingly, have never been
neglected; though Minorca has been twice taken, and is now probably lost
 for ever, that disaster was never even imputed to any neglect in the
executive power. I would not, however, be understood to insinuate, that
either of those expensive garrisons was ever, even in the smallest
degree, necessary for the purpose for which they were originally
dismembered from the Spanish monarchy. That dismemberment, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>232<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 perhaps, never served any other real purpose than to alienate from
England her natural ally the King of Spain, and to unite the two
principal branches of the house of Bourbon in a much stricter and more
permanent alliance than the ties of blood could ever have united them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_588"><span class="type-margin"><span>Joint-stock companies differ from private partnerships</span></span>Joint
 stock companies, established either by royal charter or by act of
parliament, differ in several respects, not only from regulated
companies, but from private copartneries.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_589"><span class="type-margin"><span>(1) withdrawals are by sale of shares;</span></span>First,
 In a private copartnery, no partner, without the consent of the
company, can transfer his share to another person, or introduce a new
member into the company. Each member, however, may, upon proper warning,
 withdraw from the copartnery, and demand payment from them of his share
 of the common stock. In a joint stock company, on the contrary, no
member can demand payment of his share from the company; but each member
 can, without their consent, transfer his share to another person, and
thereby introduce a new member. The value of a share in a joint stock is
 always the price which it will bring in the market; and this may be
either greater or less, in any proportion, than the sum which its owner
stands credited for in the stock of the company.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_590"><span class="type-margin"><span>(2) hability is limited to the share held.</span></span>Secondly,
 In a private copartnery, each partner is bound for the debts contracted
 by the company to the whole extent of his fortune. In a joint stock
company, on the contrary, each partner is bound only to the extent of
his share.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt410" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt410_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_591"><span class="type-margin"><span>Such companies are managed by directors, who are negligent and profuse.</span></span>The
 trade of a joint stock company is always managed by a court of
directors. This court, indeed, is frequently subject, in many respects,
to the controul of a general court of proprietors. But the greater part
of those proprietors seldom pretend to understand any thing of the
business of the company; and when the spirit of faction happens not to
prevail among them, give themselves no trouble about it, but receive
contentedly such half yearly or yearly dividend, as the directors think
proper to make to them. This total exemption from trouble and from risk,
 beyond a limited sum, encourages many people to become adventurers in
joint stock companies, who would, upon no account, hazard their fortunes
 in any private copartnery. Such companies, therefore, commonly draw to
themselves much greater stocks than any private copartnery can boast of.
 The trading stock of the South Sea Company, at one time, amounted to
upwards of thirty-three millions eight hundred thousand pounds.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt411" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt411_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> The divided capital of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>233<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the Bank of England amounts, at present, to ten millions seven hundred and eighty thousand pounds.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt412" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt412_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The directors of such companies, however, being the managers rather of
other people’s money than of their own, it cannot well be expected, that
 they should watch over it with the same anxious vigilance with which
the partners in a private copartnery frequently watch over their own.
Like the stewards of a rich man, they are apt to consider attention to
small matters as not for their master’s honour, and very easily give
themselves a dispensation from having it. Negligence and profusion,
therefore, must always prevail, more or less, in the management of the
affairs of such a company. It is upon this account that joint stock
companies for foreign trade have seldom been able to maintain the
competition against private adventurers. They have, accordingly, very
seldom succeeded without an exclusive privilege; and frequently have not
 succeeded with one. Without an exclusive privilege they have commonly
mismanaged the trade. With an exclusive privilege they have both
mismanaged and confined it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_592">The Royal African Company, the predecessors of the present<span class="type-margin"><span>Some have and some have not exclusive privileges.</span></span>
 African Company, had an exclusive privilege by charter; but as that
charter had not been confirmed by act of parliament, the trade, in
consequence of the declaration of rights, was, soon after the
revolution, laid open to all his majesty’s subjects.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt413" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt413_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> The Hudson’s Bay Company are, as to their legal rights, in the same situation as the Royal African Company.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt414" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt414_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 Their exclusive charter has not been confirmed by act of parliament.
The South Sea Company, as long as they continued to be a trading
company, had an exclusive privilege confirmed by act of parliament; as
have likewise the present United Company of Merchants trading to the
East Indies.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_593">The Royal African Company soon found that they could not maintain<span class="type-margin"><span>The Royal African Company, having lost exclusive privileges, failed</span></span>
 the competition against private adventurers, whom, notwithstanding the
declaration of rights, they continued for some time to call interlopers,
 and to persecute as such. In 1698, however, the private adventurers
were subjected to a duty of ten per cent. upon almost all the different
branches of their trade, to be employed by the company in the
maintenance of their forts and garrisons. But, notwithstanding this
heavy tax, the company were still unable to maintain the competition.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt415" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt415_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> Their stock and credit gradually declined. In 1712, their debts had become so great, that a particular act of parliament <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>234<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 was thought necessary, both for their security and for that of their
creditors. It was enacted, that the resolution of two-thirds of these
creditors in number and value, should bind the rest, both with regard to
 the time which should be allowed to the company for the payment of
their debts; and with regard to any other agreement which it might be
thought proper to make with them concerning those debts.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt416" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt416_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 In 1730, their affairs were in so great disorder, that they were
altogether incapable of maintaining their forts and garrisons, the sole
purpose and pretext of their institution. From that year, till their
final dissolution, the parliament judged it necessary to allow the
annual sum of ten thousand pounds for that purpose.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt417" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt417_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 In 1732, after having been for many years losers by the trade of
carrying negroes to the West Indies, they at last resolved to give it up
 altogether; to sell to the private traders to America the negroes which
 they purchased upon the coast; and to employ their servants in a trade
to the inland parts of Africa for gold dust, elephants teeth, dying
drugs, &amp;c. But their success in this more confined trade was not
greater than in their former extensive one.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt418" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt418_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 Their affairs continued to go gradually to decline, till at last, being
 in every respect a bankrupt company, they were dissolved by act of
parliament, and their forts and garrisons vested in the present
regulated company of merchants trading to Africa.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt419" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt419_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 Before the erection of the Royal African Company, there had been three
other joint stock companies successively established, one after another,
 for the African trade.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt420" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt420_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a>
 They were all equally unsuccessful. They all, however, had exclusive
charters, which, though not confirmed by act of parliament, were in
those days supposed to convey a real exclusive privilege.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_594"><span class="type-margin"><span>The Hudson’s
Bay Company have been moderately successful, having in fact an exclusive
 trade and a very small number of proprietors.</span></span>The Hudson’s
 Bay Company, before their misfortunes in the late war, had been much
more fortunate than the Royal African Company. Their necessary expence
is much smaller. The whole number of people whom they maintain in their
different settlements and habitations, which they have honoured with the
 name of forts, is said not to exceed a hundred and twenty persons.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt421" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt421_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">6</a>
 This number, however, is sufficient to prepare beforehand the cargo of
furs and other goods necessary for loading their ships, which, on
account of the ice, can seldom remain above six or eight weeks in those
seas. This advantage <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>235<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of having a cargo ready prepared, could not for several years be
acquired by private adventurers, and without it there seems to be no
possibility of trading to Hudson’s Bay. The moderate capital of the
company, which, it is said, does not exceed one hundred and ten thousand
 pounds,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt422" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt422_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 may besides be sufficient to enable them to engross the whole, or
almost the whole, trade and surplus produce of the miserable, though
extensive country, comprehended within their charter. No private
adventurers, accordingly, have ever attempted to trade to that country
in competition with them. This company, therefore, have always enjoyed
an exclusive trade in fact, though they may have no right to it in law.
Over and above all this, the moderate capital of this company is said to
 be divided among a very small number of proprietors.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt423" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt423_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 But a joint stock company, consisting of a small number of proprietors,
 with a moderate capital, approaches very nearly to the nature of a
private copartnery, and may be capable of nearly the same degree of
vigilance and attention. It is not to be wondered at, therefore, if in
consequence of these different advantages, the Hudson’s Bay Company had,
 before the late war, been able to carry on their trade with a
considerable degree of success. It does not seem probable, however, that
 their profits ever approached to what the late Mr. Dobbs imagined them.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt424" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt424_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 A much more sober and judicious writer, Mr. Anderson, author of The
Historical and Chronological Deduction of Commerce, very justly
observes, that upon examining the accounts which Mr. Dobbs himself has
given for several years together, of their exports and imports, and upon
 making proper allowances for their extraordinary risk and expence, it
does not appear that their profits deserve to be envied, or that they
can much, if at all, exceed the ordinary profits of trade.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt425" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt425_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_595">The South Sea Company never had any forts or garrisons to maintain,<span class="type-margin"><span>The South Sea Company failed to make any profit by their annual ship to the Spanish West Indies,</span></span>
 and therefore were entirely exempted from one great expence, to which
other joint stock companies for foreign trade are subject. But they had
an immense capital divided among an immense number of proprietors. It
was naturally to be expected, therefore, that folly, negligence, and
profusion should prevail in the whole management of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>236<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 their affairs. The knavery and extravagance of their stock-jobbing
projects are sufficiently known, and the explication of them would be
foreign to the present subject. Their mercantile projects were not much
better conducted. The first trade which they engaged in was that of
supplying the Spanish West Indies with negroes, of which (in consequence
 of what was called the Assiento contract granted them by the treaty of
Utrecht) they had the exclusive privilege. But as it was not expected
that much profit could be made by this trade, both the Portugueze and
French companies, who had enjoyed it upon the same terms before them,
having been ruined by it, they were allowed, as compensation, to send
annually a ship of a certain burden to trade directly to the Spanish
West Indies.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt426" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt426_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Of the ten voyages which this annual ship was allowed to make, they are
 said to have gained considerably by one, that of the Royal Caroline in
1731, and to have been losers, more or less, by almost all the rest.
Their ill success was imputed, by their factors and agents, to the
extortion and oppression of the Spanish government; but was, perhaps,
principally owing to the profusion and depredations of those very
factors and agents; some of whom are said to have acquired great
fortunes even in one year. In 1734, the company petitioned the king,
that they might be allowed to dispose of the trade and tunnage of their
annual ship, on account of the little profit which they made by it, and
to accept of such equivalent as they could obtain from the king of
Spain.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt427" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt427_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>

 1724, this company had undertaken the whale-fishery. Of this, indeed,
they had no monopoly; but as long as they carried it on, no other
British subjects appear to have engaged in it. Of the eight voyages
which their ships made to Greenland, they were gainers by one, and
losers by all the rest. After their eighth and last voyage, when they
had sold their ships, stores, and utensils, they found that their whole
loss, upon this branch, capital and interest included, amounted to
upwards of two hundred and thirty-seven thousand pounds.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt428" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt428_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>

 1722, this company petitioned the parliament to be allowed to divide
their immense capital of more than thirty-three millions eight hundred
thousand pounds, the whole of which had been lent to government, into
two equal parts: The one half, or upwards of sixteen millions nine
hundred thousand pounds, to be put upon the same footing with other
government annuities, and not to be subject to the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>237<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 debts contracted, or losses incurred, by the directors of the company,
in the prosecution of their mercantile projects; the other half to
remain, as before, a trading stock, and to be subject to those debts and
 losses. The petition was too reasonable not to be granted.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt429" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt429_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 In 1733, they again petitioned the parliament, that three-fourths of
their trading stock might be turned into annuity stock, and only
one-fourth remain as trading stock, or exposed to the hazards arising
from the bad management of their directors.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt430" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt430_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 Both their annuity and trading stocks had, by this time, been reduced
more than two millions each, by several different payments from
government; so that this fourth amounted only to 3,662,784 l. 8 s. 6 d.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt431" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt431_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 In 1748, all the demands of the company upon the king of Spain, in
consequence of the Assiento contract, were, by the treaty of
Aix-la-Chapelle, given up for what was supposed an equivalent. An end
was put to their trade with the Spanish West Indies, the remainder of
their trading stock was turned into an annuity stock, and the company
ceased in every respect to be a trading company.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt432" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt432_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_598">It ought to be observed, that in the trade which the South Sea<span class="type-margin"><span>They had competitors in the trade of the annual ship.</span></span>
 Company carried on by means of their annual ship, the only trade by
which it ever was expected that they could make any considerable profit,
 they were not without competitors, either in the foreign or in the home
 market. At Carthagena, Porto Bello, and La Vera Cruz, they had to
encounter the competition of the Spanish merchants, who brought from
Cadiz, to those markets, European goods, of the same kind with the
outward cargo of their ship; and in England they had to encounter that
of the English merchants, who imported from Cadiz goods of the Spanish
West Indies, of the same kind with the inward cargo. The goods both of
the Spanish and English merchants, indeed, were, perhaps, subject to
higher duties. But the loss occasioned by the negligence, profusion, and
 malversation of the servants of the company, had probably been a tax
much heavier than all those duties. That a joint stock company should be
 able to carry on successfully any branch of foreign trade, when private
 adventurers can come into any sort of open and fair competition with
them, seems contrary to all experience.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_599">The old English East India Company was established in 1600, by a<span class="type-margin"><span>The old East India Company, unable to support competition,</span></span>
 charter from Queen Elizabeth. In the first twelve voyages which they
fitted out for India, they appear to have traded as a regulated company,
 <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>238<span class="bracket">]</span></span> with separate stocks, though only in the general ships of the company. In 1612, they united into a joint stock.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt433" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt433_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Their charter was exclusive, and though not confirmed by act of
parliament, was in those days supposed to convey a real exclusive
privilege. For many years, therefore, they were not much disturbed by
interlopers. Their capital which never exceeded seven hundred and
forty-four thousand pounds,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt434" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt434_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> and of which fifty pounds was a share,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt435" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt435_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 was not so exorbitant, nor their dealings so extensive, as to afford
either a pretext for gross negligence and profusion, or a cover to gross
 malversation. Notwithstanding some extraordinary losses, occasioned
partly by the malice of the Dutch East India Company, and partly by
other accidents, they carried on for many years a successful trade. But
in process of time, when the principles of liberty were better
understood, it became every day more and more doubtful how far a royal
charter, not confirmed by act of parliament, could convey an exclusive
privilege. Upon this question the decisions of the courts of justice
were not uniform, but varied with the authority of government and the
humours of the times. Interlopers multiplied upon them; and towards the
end of the reign of Charles II. through the whole of that of James II.
and during a part of that of William III. reduced them to great
distress.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt436" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt436_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 In 1698, a proposal was made to parliament of advancing two millions to
 government at eight per cent. provided the subscribers were erected
into a new East India Company with exclusive privileges. The old East
India Company offered seven hundred thousand pounds, nearly the amount
of their capital, at four per cent. upon the same conditions. But such
was at that time the state of public credit, that it was more convenient
 for government to borrow two millions at<span class="type-margin"><span>was superseded by the present company,</span></span>
 eight per cent. than seven hundred thousand pounds at four. The
proposal of the new subscribers was accepted, and a new East India
Company established in consequence. The old East India Company, however,
 had a right to continue their trade till 1701. They had, at the same
time, in the name of their treasurer, subscribed, very artfully, three
hundred and fifteen thousand pounds into the stock of the new. By a
negligence in the expression of the act of parliament, which vested the
East India trade in the subscribers to this loan of two millions, it did
 not appear evident that they were all obliged to unite into a joint
stock.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt437" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt437_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a> A few private traders, whose subscriptions amounted only to <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>239<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 seven thousand two hundred pounds, insisted upon the privilege of
trading separately upon their own stocks and at their own risk.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt438" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt438_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The old East India Company had a right to a separate trade upon their
old stock till 1701; and they had likewise, both before and after that
period, a right, like that of other private traders, to a separate trade
 upon the three hundred and fifteen thousand pounds, which they had
subscribed into the stock of the new company. The competition of the two
 companies with the private traders, and with one another, is said to
have well nigh ruined both. Upon a subsequent occasion, in 1730, when a
proposal was made to parliament for putting the trade under the
management of a regulated company, and thereby laying it in some measure
 open, the East India Company, in opposition to this proposal,
represented in very strong terms, what had been, at this time, the
miserable effects, as they thought them, of this competition. In India,
they said, it raised the price of goods so high, that they were not
worth the buying; and in England, by overstocking the market, it sunk
their price so low, that no profit could be made by them.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt439" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt439_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 That by a more plentiful supply, to the great advantage and conveniency
 of the public, it must have reduced, very much, the price of India
goods in the English market, cannot well be doubted; but that it should
have raised very much their price in the Indian market, seems not very
probable, as all the extraordinary demand which that competition could
occasion, must have been but as a drop of water in the immense ocean of
Indian commerce. The increase of demand, besides, though in the
beginning it may sometimes raise the price of goods, never fails to
lower it in the long run. It encourages production, and thereby
increases the competition of the producers, who, in order to undersell
one another, have recourse to new divisions of labour and new
improvements of art, which might never otherwise have been thought of.
The miserable effects of which the company complained, were the
cheapness of consumption and the encouragement given to production,
precisely the two effects which it is the great business of political
œconomy to promote. The competition, however, of which they gave this
doleful account, had not been allowed to be of long continuance. In
1702, the two companies, were, in some measure, united by an indenture
tripartite, to which the queen was the third party;<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt440" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt440_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 and in 1708, they were, by act of parliament, perfectly consolidated
into one company by their present name of the United Company of
Merchants trading to <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>240<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 the East Indies. Into this act it was thought worth while to insert a
clause, allowing the separate traders to continue their trade till
Michaelmas 1711, but at the same time empowering the directors, upon
three years notice, to redeem their little capital of seven thousand two
 hundred pounds, and thereby to convert the whole stock of the company
into a joint stock. By the same act, the capital of the company, in
consequence of a new loan to government, was augmented from two millions
 to three millions two hundred thousand pounds.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt441" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt441_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 In 1743, the company advanced another million to government. But this
million being raised, not by a call upon the proprietors, but by selling
 annuities and contracting bond-debts, it did not augment the stock upon
 which the proprietors could claim a dividend. It augmented, however,
their trading stock, it being equally liable with the other three
millions two hundred thousand pounds to the losses sustained, and debts
contracted, by the company in prosecution of their mercantile<span class="type-margin"><span>which with exclusive privileges has traded successfully,</span></span>
 projects. From 1708, or at least from 1711, this company, being
delivered from all competitors, and fully established in the monopoly of
 the English commerce to the East Indies, carried on a successful trade,
 and from their profits made annually a moderate dividend to<span class="type-margin"><span>but has conquered large territories.</span></span>
 their proprietors. During the French war which began in 1741, the
ambition of Mr. Dupleix, the French governor of Pondicherry, involved
them in the wars of the Carnatic, and in the politics of the Indian
princes. After many signal successes, and equally signal losses, they at
 last lost Madras, at that time their principal settlement in India. It
was restored to them by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle; and about this
time the spirit of war and conquest seems to have taken possession of
their servants in India, and never since to have left them. During the
French war which began in 1755, their arms partook of the general good
fortune of those of Great Britain. They defended Madras, took
Pondicherry, recovered Calcutta, and acquired the revenues of a rich and
 extensive territory, amounting, it was then said, to upwards of three
millions a-year. They remained for several years in quiet possession of
this revenue: But in 1767, administration laid claim to their
territorial acquisitions, and the revenue arising from them, as of right
 belonging to the crown; and the company, in compensation for this
claim, agreed to pay to government four hundred thousand pounds a-year.
They had before this gradually augmented their dividend from about six
to ten per cent.; that is, upon their capital of three millions two
hundred thousand pounds, they had increased it by a hundred and
twenty-eight thousand pounds, or had raised it from one hundred and <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>241<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 ninety-two thousand, to three hundred and twenty thousand pounds
a-year. They were attempting about this time to raise it still further,
to twelve and a half per cent. which would have made their annual
payments to their proprietors equal to what they had agreed to pay
annually to government, or to four hundred thousand pounds a-year. But
during the two years in which their agreement with government was to
take place, they were restrained from any further increase of dividend
by two successive acts of parliament,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt442" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt442_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 of which the object was to enable them to make a speedier progress in
the payment of their debts, which were at this time estimated at upwards
 of six or seven millions sterling. In 1769, they renewed their
agreement with government for five years more, and stipulated, that
during the course of that period they should be allowed gradually to
increase their dividend to twelve and a half per cent.; never increasing
 it, however, more than one per cent. in one year. This increase of
dividend, therefore, when it had risen to its utmost height, could
augment their annual payments, to their proprietors and government
together, but by six hundred and eight thousand pounds, beyond what they
 had been before their late territorial acquisitions. What the gross
revenue of those territorial acquisitions was supposed to amount to, has
 already been mentioned; and by an account brought by the Cruttenden
East Indiaman in 1768, the nett revenue, clear of all deductions and
military charges, was stated at two millions forty-eight thousand seven
hundred and forty-seven pounds. They were said at the same time to
possess another revenue, arising partly from lands, but chiefly from the
 customs established at their different settlements, amounting to four
hundred and thirty-nine thousand pounds. The profits of their trade too,
 according to the evidence of their chairman before the House of
Commons, amounted at this time to at least four hundred thousand pounds
a-year; according to that of their accomptant, to at least five hundred
thousand; according to the lowest account, at least equal to the highest
 dividend that was to be paid to their proprietors. So great a revenue
might certainly have afforded an augmentation of six hundred and eight
thousand pounds in their annual payments; and at the same time have left
 a large sinking fund sufficient for the speedy reduction of their
debts. In 1773, however, their debts, instead<span class="type-margin"><span>and mismanaged them.</span></span>
 of being reduced, were augmented by an arrear to the treasury in the
payment of the four hundred thousand pounds, by another to the
custom-house for duties unpaid, by a large debt to the bank for money
borrowed, and by a fourth for bills drawn upon them from India, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>242<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 and wantonly accepted, to the amount of upwards of twelve hundred
thousand pounds. The distress which these accumulated claims brought
upon them, obliged them not only to reduce all at once their dividend to
 six per cent. but to throw themselves upon the mercy of government, and
 to supplicate, first, a release from the further payment of the
stipulated four hundred thousand pounds a-year; and, secondly, a loan of
 fourteen hundred thousand, to save them from immediate bankruptcy. The
great increase of their fortune had, it seems, only served to furnish
their servants with a pretext for greater profusion, and a cover for
greater malversation, than in proportion even to that increase of
fortune.<span class="type-margin"><span>so that Parliament has been obliged to make alterations,</span></span>
 The conduct of their servants in India, and the general state of their
affairs both in India and in Europe, became the subject of a
parliamentary inquiry;<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt443" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt443_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 in consequence of which several very important alterations were made in
 the constitution of their government, both at home and abroad. In India
 their principal settlements of Madras, Bombay, and Calcutta, which had
before been altogether independent of one another, were subjected to a
governor-general, assisted by a council of four assessors, parliament
assuming to itself the first nomination of this governor and council who
 were to reside at Calcutta; that city having now become, what Madras
was before, the most important of the English settlements in India. The
court of the mayor of Calcutta, originally instituted for the trial of
mercantile causes, which arose in the city and neighbourhood, had
gradually extended its jurisdiction with the extension of the empire. It
 was now reduced and confined to the original purpose of its
institution. Instead of it a new supreme court of judicature was
established, consisting of a chief justice and three judges to be
appointed by the crown. In Europe, the qualification necessary to
entitle a proprietor to vote at their general courts was raised, from
five hundred pounds, the original price of a share in the stock of the
company, to a thousand pounds. In order to vote upon this qualification
too, it was declared necessary that he should have possessed it, if
acquired by his own purchase, and not by inheritance, for at least one
year, instead of six months, the term requisite before. The court of
twenty-four directors had before been chosen annually; but it was now
enacted that each director should, for the future, be chosen for four
years; six of them, however, to go out of office by rotation every year,
 and not to be capable of being re-chosen at the election of the six new
 directors for the ensuing year.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt444" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt444_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> In consequence of these alterations, the courts, both of the proprietors and directors, it was expected, would be likely <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>243<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 to act with more dignity and steadiness than they had usually done
before. But it seems impossible, by any alterations, to render those
courts, in any respect, fit to govern, or even to share in the
government of a great empire; because the greater part of their members
must always have too little interest in the prosperity of that empire,
to give any serious attention to what may promote it. Frequently a man
of great, sometimes even a man of small fortune, is willing to purchase a
 thousand pounds share in India stock, merely for the influence which he
 expects to acquire by a vote in the court of proprietors. It gives him a
 share, though not in the plunder, yet in the appointment of the
plunderers of India; the court of directors, though they make that
appointment, being necessarily more or less under the influence of the
proprietors, who not only elect those directors, but sometimes overrule
the appointments of their servants in India. Provided he can enjoy this
influence for a few years, and thereby provide for a certain number of
his friends, he frequently cares little about the dividend; or even
about the value of the stock upon which his vote is founded. About the
prosperity of the great empire, in the government of which that vote
gives him a share, he seldom cares at all. No other sovereigns ever
were, or, from the nature of things, ever could be, so perfectly
indifferent about the happiness or misery of their subjects, the
improvement or waste of their dominions, the glory or disgrace of their
administration; as, from irresistible moral causes, the greater part of
the proprietors of such a mercantile company are, and necessarily must
be. This indifference too was more likely to be increased than
diminished by some of the new regulations which were made in consequence
 of the parliamentary inquiry. By a resolution of the House of Commons,
for example, it was declared, that when the fourteen hundred thousand
pounds lent to the company by government should be paid, and their
bond-debts be reduced to fifteen hundred thousand pounds, they might
then, and not till then, divide eight per cent. upon their capital; and
that whatever remained of their revenues and neat profits at home,
should be divided into four parts; three of them to be paid into the
exchequer for the use of the public, and the fourth to be reserved as a
fund, either for the further reduction of their bond-debts, or for the
discharge of other contingent exigencies, which the company might labour
 under.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt445" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt445_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> But if the company were bad stewards,<span class="type-margin"><span>which are not likely to be of service.</span></span> and bad sovereigns, when the whole of their nett<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt446" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt446_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> revenue and profits <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>244<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 belonged to themselves, and were at their own disposal, they were
surely not likely to be better, when three-fourths of them were to
belong to other people, and the other fourth, though to be laid out for
the benefit of the company, yet to be so, under the inspection, and with
 the approbation, of other people.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_600"><span class="type-margin"><span>They tend to encourage waste,</span></span>It
 might be more agreeable to the company that their own servants and
dependants should have either the pleasure of wasting, or the profit of
embezzling whatever surplus might remain, after paying the proposed
dividend of eight per cent., than that it should come into the hands of a
 set of people with whom those resolutions could scarce fail to set
them, in some measure, at variance. The interest of those servants and
dependants might so far predominate in the court of proprietors, as
sometimes to dispose it to support the authors of depredations which had
 been committed in direct violation of its own authority. With the
majority of proprietors, the support even of the authority of their own
court might sometimes be a matter of less consequence, than the support
of those who had set that authority at defiance.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_601"><span class="type-margin"><span>and the company is now in greater distress than ever.</span></span>The
 regulations of 1773, accordingly, did not put an end to the disorders
of the company’s government in India. Notwithstanding that, during a
momentary fit of good conduct, they had at one time collected, into the
treasury of Calcutta, more than three millions sterling; notwithstanding
 that they had afterwards extended, either their dominion, or their
depredations over a vast accession of some of the richest and most
fertile countries in India; all was wasted and destroyed. They found
themselves altogether unprepared to stop or resist the incursion of
Hyder Ali; and, in consequence of those disorders, the company is now
(1784) in greater distress than ever; and, in order to prevent immediate
 bankruptcy, is once more reduced to supplicate the assistance of
government. Different plans have been proposed by the different parties
in parliament, for the better management of its affairs. And all those
plans seem to agree in supposing, what was indeed always abundantly
evident, that it is altogether unfit to govern its territorial
possessions. Even the company itself seems to be convinced of its own
incapacity so far, and seems, upon that account, willing to give them up
 to government.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_602"><span class="type-margin"><span>Companies misuse the right of making peace and war</span></span>With
 the right of possessing forts and garrisons in distant and barbarous
countries, is necessarily connected the right of making peace and war in

<p id="Smith_0206-02_603">When a company of merchants undertake, at their own risk and<span class="type-margin"><span>The
 grant of a temporary monopoly to a joint-stock company may sometimes be

 expence, to establish a new trade with some remote and barbarous
nation, it may not be unreasonable to incorporate them into a joint
stock company, and to grant them, in case of their success, a monopoly
of the trade for a certain number of years. It is the easiest and most
natural way in which the state can recompense them for hazarding a
dangerous and expensive experiment, of which the public is afterwards to
 reap the benefit. A temporary monopoly of this kind may be vindicated
upon the same principles upon which a like monopoly of a new machine is
granted to its inventor, and that of a new book to its author. But upon
the expiration of the term, the monopoly ought certainly to determine;
the forts and garrisons, if it was found necessary to establish any, to
be taken into the hands of government, their value to be paid to the
company, and the trade to be laid open to all the subjects of the state.
 By a perpetual monopoly, all the other subjects of the state are taxed
very absurdly in two different ways; first, by the high price of goods,
which, in the case of a free trade, they could buy much cheaper; and,
secondly, by their total exclusion from a branch of business, which it
might be both convenient and profitable for many of them to carry on. It
 is for the most worthless of all purposes too that they are taxed in
this manner. It is merely to enable the company to support the
negligence, profusion, and malversation of their own servants, whose
disorderly conduct seldom allows the dividend of the company to exceed
the ordinary rate of profit in trades which are altogether free, and
very frequently makes it fall even a good deal short of that rate.
Without a monopoly, however, a joint stock company, it would appear from
 experience, cannot long carry on any branch of foreign trade. To buy in
 one market, in order to sell, with profit, in another, when there are
many competitors in both; to watch over, not only the occasional
variations in the demand, but the much greater and more frequent
variations in the competition, or in the supply which that demand is
likely to get from other people, and to suit with dexterity and judgment
 both the quantity and quality of each assortment of goods to all these
circumstances, is a species of warfare of which the operations are
continually changing, and which can scarce ever be conducted
successfully, without such an unremitting exertion of vigilance and
attention, as cannot long be expected from the directors of a joint
stock company. The East India Company, upon the redemption <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>246<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of their funds, and the expiration of their exclusive privilege, have a
 right, by act of parliament, to continue a corporation with a joint
stock, and to trade in their corporate capacity to the East Indies in
common with the rest of their fellow-subjects. But in this situation,
the superior vigilance and attention of private adventurers would, in
all probability, soon make them weary of the trade.</p>

<p id="Smith_0206-02_605"><span class="type-margin"><span>Only four trades can be well carried on by a company with no exclusive privilege, namely,</span></span>The
 only trades which it seems possible for a joint stock company to carry
on successfully, without an exclusive privilege, are those, of which all
 the operations are capable of being reduced to what is called a
routine, or to such a uniformity of method as admits of little or no
variation. Of this kind is, first, the banking trade; secondly, the
trade of insurance from fire, and from sea risk and capture in time of
war; thirdly, the trade of making and maintaining a navigable cut or
canal; and, fourthly, the similar trade of bringing water for the supply
 of a great city.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_606"><span class="type-margin"><span>banking</span></span>Though
 the principles of the banking trade may appear somewhat abstruse, the
practice is capable of being reduced to strict rules. To depart upon any
 occasion from those rules, in consequence of some flattering
speculation of extraordinary gain, is almost always extremely dangerous,
 and frequently fatal to the banking company which attempts it. But the
constitution of joint stock companies renders them in general more
tenacious of established rules than any private copartnery. Such
companies, therefore, seem extremely well fitted for this trade. The
principal banking companies in Europe, accordingly, are joint stock
companies, many of which manage their trade very successfully without
any exclusive privilege. The Bank of England has no other exclusive
privilege, except that no other banking company in England shall consist
 of more than six persons.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt448" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt448_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> The two banks of Edinburgh are joint stock companies without any exclusive privilege.</p>

<p id="Smith_0206-02_607">The value of the risk, either from fire, or from loss by sea, or by<span class="type-margin"><span>insurance,</span></span>
 capture, though it cannot, perhaps, be calculated very exactly, admits,
 however, of such a gross estimation as renders it, in some degree,
reducible to strict rule and method. The trade of insurance, therefore,
may be carried on successfully by a joint stock company, without any
exclusive privilege. Neither the London Assurance, nor the Royal
Exchange Assurance companies, have any such privilege.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt449" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt449_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_608">When a navigable cut or canal has been once made, the management<span class="type-margin"><span>canal and aqueduct management and construction</span></span> of it becomes quite simple and easy, and<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt450" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt450_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 is reducible to strict rule and method. Even the making of it is so, as
 it may be contracted for with undertakers at so much a mile, and so
much a lock. The same thing may be said of a canal, an aqueduct, or a
great pipe for bringing water to supply a great city. Such undertakings,
 therefore, may be, and accordingly frequently are, very successfully
managed by joint stock companies without any exclusive privilege.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_609">To establish a joint stock company, however, for any undertaking,<span class="type-margin"><span>A
 joint stock company ought not to be established except for some purpose
 of remarkable utility, requiring a larger capital than can be provided
by a private partnership.</span></span> merely because such a company
might be capable of managing it successfully; or to exempt a particular
set of dealers from some of the general laws which take place with
regard to all their neighbours, merely because they might be capable of
thriving if they had such an exemption, would certainly not be
reasonable. To render such an establishment perfectly reasonable, with
the circumstance of being reducible to strict rule and method, two other
 circumstances ought to concur. First, it ought to appear with the
clearest evidence, that the undertaking is of greater and more general
utility than the greater part of common trades; and secondly, that it
requires a greater capital than can easily be collected into a private
copartnery. If a moderate capital were<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt451" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt451_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 sufficient, the great utility of the undertaking would not be a
sufficient reason for establishing a joint stock company; because, in
this case, the demand for what it was to produce, would readily and
easily be supplied by private adventurers. In the four trades above
mentioned, both those circumstances concur.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_610">The great and general utility of the banking trade when prudently<span class="type-margin"><span>These conditions are fulfilled by banking,</span></span> managed, has been fully explained in the second book of this inquiry.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt452" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt452_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 But a public bank which is to support public credit, and upon
particular emergencies to advance to government the whole produce of a
tax, to the amount, perhaps, of several millions, a year or two before
it comes in, requires a greater capital than can easily be collected
into any private copartnery.</p>

<p id="Smith_0206-02_611"><span class="type-margin"><span>insurance.</span></span>The
 trade of insurance gives great security to the fortunes of private
people, and by dividing among a great many that loss which would ruin an
 individual, makes it fall light and easy upon the whole society. In
order to give this security, however, it is necessary that the insurers
should have a very large capital. Before the establishment of the two
joint stock companies for insurance in London, a list, it is said, was
laid before the attorney-general, of one hundred and fifty private
insurers who had failed in the course of a few years.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_612"><span class="type-margin"><span>canals and water works,</span></span>That
 navigable cuts and canals, and the works which are sometimes necessary
for supplying a great city with water, are of great and general utility;
 while at the same time they frequently require a greater expence than
suits the fortunes of private people, is sufficiently obvious.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_613"><span class="type-margin"><span>but not by anything else.</span></span>Except
 the four trades above mentioned, I have not been able to recollect any
other in which all the three circumstances, requisite for rendering
reasonable the establishment of a joint stock company, concur. The
English copper company of London, the lead smelting company, the glass
grinding company, have not even the pretext of any great or singular
utility in the object which they pursue; nor does the pursuit of that
object seem to require any expence unsuitable to the fortunes of many
private men. Whether the trade which those companies carry on, is
reducible to such strict rule and method as to render it fit for the
management of a joint stock company, or whether they have any reason to
boast of their extraordinary profits, I do not pretend to know. The
mine-adventurers company has been long ago bankrupt.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt453" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt453_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 A share in the stock of the British Linen Company of Edinburgh sells,
at present, very much below par, though less so than it did some years
ago. The joint stock companies, which are established for the
public-spirited purpose of promoting some particular manufacture, over
and above managing their own affairs ill, to the diminution of the
general stock of the society, can in other respects scarce ever fail to
do more harm than good. Notwithstanding the most upright intentions, the
 unavoidable partiality of their directors to particular branches of the
 manufacture, of which the undertakers mislead and impose upon them, is a
 real discouragement to the rest, and necessarily breaks, more or less,
that natural proportion which would otherwise establish itself between
judicious industry and profit, and which, to the general industry of the
 country, is of all encouragements the greatest and the most effectual.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt454" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt454_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>

 manner, furnish a revenue sufficient for defraying their own expence.
The fee or honorary which the scholar pays to the master naturally
constitutes a revenue of this kind.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_615">Even where the reward of the master does not arise altogether from<span class="type-margin"><span>or may be endowed.</span></span>
 this natural revenue, it still is not necessary that it should be
derived from that general revenue of the society, of which the
collection and application are,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt456" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt456_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 in most countries, assigned to the executive power. Through the greater
 part of Europe, accordingly, the endowment of schools and colleges
makes either no charge upon that general revenue, or but a very small
one. It every where arises chiefly from some local or provincial
revenue, from the rent of some landed estate, or from the interest of
some sum of money allotted and put under the management of trustees for
this particular purpose, sometimes by the sovereign himself, and
sometimes by some private donor.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_616">Have those public endowments contributed in general to promote<span class="type-margin"><span>Have endowment, really promoted useful education</span></span>
 the end of their institution? Have they contributed to encourage the
diligence, and to improve the abilities of the teachers? Have they
directed the course of education towards objects more useful, both to
the individual and to the public, than those to which it would naturally
 have gone of its own accord? It should not seem very difficult to give
at least a probable answer to each of those questions.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_617">In every profession, the exertion of the greater part of those who<span class="type-margin"><span>Exertion is always in proportion to its necessity.</span></span>
 exercise it, is always in proportion to the necessity they are under of
 making that exertion. This necessity is greatest with those to whom the
 emoluments of their profession are the only source from which they
expect their fortune, or even their ordinary revenue and subsistence. In
 order to acquire this fortune, or even to get this subsistence, they
must, in the course of a year,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt457" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt457_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 execute a certain quantity of work of a known value; and, where the
competition is free, the rivalship of competitors, who are all
endeavouring to justle one another out of employment, obliges every man
to endeavour to execute his work with a certain degree of exactness. The
 greatness of the objects which are to be acquired by success in some
particular professions may, no doubt, sometimes animate the exertion of a
 few men of extraordinary spirit and ambition. Great objects, however,
are evidently not necessary <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>250<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 in order to occasion the greatest exertions. Rivalship and emulation
render excellency, even in mean professions, an object of ambition, and
frequently occasion the very greatest exertions. Great objects, on the
contrary, alone and unsupported by the necessity of application, have
seldom been sufficient to occasion any considerable exertion. In
England, success in the profession of the law leads to some very great
objects of ambition; and yet how few men, born to easy fortunes, have
ever in this country been eminent in that profession?</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_618"><span class="type-margin"><span>Endowments diminish the necessity of application,</span></span>The
 endowments of schools and colleges have necessarily diminished more or
less the necessity of application in the teachers. Their subsistence, so
 far as it arises from their salaries, is evidently derived from a fund
altogether independent of their success and reputation in their
particular professions.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_619"><span class="type-margin"><span>which is not entirely removed where the teacher receives part of his emoluments from fees,</span></span>In
 some universities the salary makes but a part, and frequently but a
small part of the emoluments of the teacher, of which the greater part
arises from the honoraries or fees of his pupils. The necessity of
application, though always more or less diminished, is not in this case
entirely taken away.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt458" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt458_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Reputation in his profession is still of some importance to him, and he
 still has some dependency upon the affection, gratitude, and favourable
 report of those who have attended upon his instructions; and these
favourable sentiments he is likely to gain in no way so well as by
deserving them, that is, by the abilities and diligence with which he
discharges every part of his duty.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_620"><span class="type-margin"><span>but is entirely absent when his whole revenue arises from endowments.</span></span>In
 other universities the teacher is prohibited from receiving any
honorary or fee from his pupils, and his salary constitutes the whole of
 the revenue which he derives from his office. His interest is, in this
case, set as directly in opposition to his duty as it is possible to set
 it. It is the interest of every man to live as much at his ease as he
can; and if his emoluments are to be precisely the same, whether he
does, or does not perform some very laborious duty, it is certainly his
interest, at least as interest is vulgarly understood, either to neglect
 it altogether, or, if he is subject to some authority which will not
suffer him to do this, to perform it in as careless and slovenly a
manner as that authority will permit. If he is naturally active and a
lover of labour, it is his interest to employ that activity in any way,
from which he can derive some advantage, rather than in the performance
of his duty, from which he can derive none.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_621"><span class="type-margin"><span>Members of a college or university are indulgent to their fellow members.</span></span>If
 the authority to which he is subject resides in the body corporate, the
 college, or university, of which he himself is a member, and in <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>251<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 which the greater part of the other members are, like himself, persons
who either are, or ought to be teachers; they are likely to make a
common cause, to be all very indulgent to one another, and every man to
consent that his neighbour may neglect his duty, provided he himself is
allowed to neglect his own. In the university of Oxford, the greater
part of the public professors have, for these many years, given up
altogether even the pretence of teaching.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_622">If the authority to which he is subject resides, not so much in the<span class="type-margin"><span>External control is ignorant and capricious.</span></span>
 body corporate of which he is a member, as in some other extraneous
persons, in the bishop of the diocese for example; in the governor of
the province; or, perhaps, in some minister of state; it is not indeed
in this case very likely that he will be suffered to neglect his duty
altogether. All that such superiors, however, can force him to do, is to
 attend upon his pupils a certain number of hours, that is, to give a
certain number of lectures in the week or in the year. What those
lectures shall be, must still depend upon the diligence of the teacher;
and that diligence is likely to be proportioned to the motives which he
has for exerting it. An extraneous jurisdiction of this kind, besides,
is liable to be exercised both ignorantly and capriciously. In its
nature it is arbitrary and discretionary, and the persons who exercise
it, neither attending upon the lectures of the teacher themselves, nor
perhaps understanding the sciences which it is his business to teach,
are seldom capable of exercising it with judgment. From the insolence of
 office too they are frequently indifferent how they exercise it, and
are very apt to censure or deprive him of his office wantonly, and
without any just cause. The person subject to such jurisdiction is
necessarily degraded by it, and, instead of being one of the most
respectable, is rendered one of the meanest and most contemptible
persons in the society. It is by powerful protection only that he can
effectually guard himself against the bad usage to which he is at all
times exposed; and this protection he is most likely to gain, not by
ability or diligence in his profession, but by obsequiousness to the
will of his superiors, and by being ready, at all times, to sacrifice to
 that will the rights, the interest, and the honour of the body
corporate of which he is a member. Whoever has attended for any
considerable time to the administration of a French university, must
have had occasion to remark the effects which naturally result from an
arbitrary and extraneous jurisdiction of this kind.</p>

 and divinity, when they can be obtained only by residing a certain
number of years in certain universities, necessarily force a certain
number of students to such universities, independent of the merit or
reputation of the teachers. The privileges of graduates are a sort of
statutes of apprenticeship, which have contributed to the improvement of
 education, just as the<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt460" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt460_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> other statutes of apprenticeship have to that of arts and manufactures.</p>

the students upon such charitable foundations left free to chuse what
college they liked best, such liberty might perhaps contribute to<span class="type-margin"><span>regulations against migration,</span></span>
 excite some emulation among different colleges. A regulation, on the
contrary, which prohibited even the independent members of every
particular college from leaving it, and going to any other, without
leave first asked and obtained of that which they meant to abandon,
would tend very much to extinguish that emulation.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_626"><span class="type-margin"><span>and assignment of students to particular tutors are equally pernicious</span></span>If
 in each college the tutor or teacher, who was to instruct each student
in all arts and sciences, should not be voluntarily chosen by the
student, but appointed by the head of the college; and if, in case of
neglect, inability, or bad usage, the student should not be allowed to
change him for another, without leave first asked and obtained; such a
regulation would not only tend very much to extinguish all emulation
among the different tutors of the same college, but to diminish very
much in all of them the necessity of diligence and of attention to their
 respective pupils. Such teachers, though very well paid by their
students, might be as much disposed to neglect them, as those who are
not paid by them at all, or who have no other recompence but their
salary.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_627"><span class="type-margin"><span>Where such regulations prevail a teacher may avoid or suppress all visible signs of disapprobation on the part of his pupils</span></span>If
 the teacher happens to be a man of sense, it must be an unpleasant
thing to him to be conscious, while he is lecturing his students, that
he is either speaking or reading nonsense, or what is very little better
 than nonsense. It must too be unpleasant to him to observe that the
greater part of his students desert his lectures; or perhaps attend upon
 them with plain enough marks of neglect, contempt, and derision. If he
is obliged, therefore, to give a certain number of lectures, these
motives alone, without any other interest, might dispose him to take
some pains to give tolerably good ones. Several different expedients,
however, may be fallen upon, which will <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>253<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 effectually blunt the edge of all those incitements to diligence. The
teacher, instead of explaining to his pupils himself the science in
which he proposes to instruct them, may read some book upon it; and if
this book is written in a foreign and dead language, by interpreting it
to them into their own; or, what would give him still less trouble, by
making them interpret it to him, and by now and then making an
occasional remark upon it, he may flatter himself that he is giving a
lecture. The slightest degree of knowledge and application will enable
him to do this, without exposing himself to contempt or derision, or
saying any thing that is really foolish, absurd, or ridiculous. The
discipline of the college, at the same time, may enable him to force all
 his pupils to the most regular attendance upon this sham-lecture, and
to maintain the most decent and respectful behaviour during the whole
time of the performance.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_628">The discipline of colleges and universities is in general contrived,<span class="type-margin"><span>University
 and college discipline is contrived for the ease of the teachers, and
quite unnecessary if the teachers are tolerably diligent</span></span>
not for the benefit of the students, but for the interest, or more
properly speaking, for the ease of the masters. Its object is, in all
cases, to maintain the authority of the master, and whether he neglects
or performs his duty, to oblige the students in all cases to behave to
him as if he performed it with the greatest diligence and ability. It
seems to presume perfect wisdom and virtue in the one order, and the
greatest weakness and folly in the other. Where the masters, however,
really perform their duty, there are no examples, I believe, that the
greater part of the students ever neglect theirs. No discipline is ever
requisite to force attendance upon lectures which are really worth the
attending, as is well known wherever any such lectures are given. Force
and restraint may, no doubt, be in some degree requisite in order to
oblige children, or very young boys, to attend to those parts of
education which it is thought necessary for them to acquire during that
early period of life; but after twelve or thirteen years of age,
provided the master does his duty, force or restraint can scarce ever be
 necessary to carry on any part of education. Such is the generosity of
the greater part of young men, that, so far from being disposed to
neglect or despise the instructions of their master, provided he shows
some serious intention of being of use to them, they are generally
inclined to pardon a great deal of incorrectness in the performance of
his duty, and sometimes even to conceal from the public a good deal of
gross negligence.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_629">Those parts of education, it is to be observed, for the teaching of<span class="type-margin"><span>The parts of education that are not conducted by public institutions are better taught.</span></span>
 which there are no public institutions, are generally the best taught.
When a young man goes to a fencing or a dancing school, he does not <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>254<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 indeed always learn to fence or to dance very well; but he seldom fails
 of learning to fence or to dance. The good effects of the riding school
 are not commonly so evident. The expence of a riding school is so
great, that in most places it is a public institution. The three most
essential parts of literary education, to read, write, and account, it
still continues to be more common to acquire in private than in public
schools; and it very seldom happens that any body fails of acquiring
them to the degree in which it is necessary to acquire them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_630"><span class="type-margin"><span>English public schools, where the teachers depend more upon fees, are less corrupt than the universities.</span></span>In
 England the public schools are much less corrupted than the
universities. In the schools the youth are taught, or at least may be
taught, Greek and Latin; that is, every thing which the masters pretend
to teach, or which, it is expected, they should teach. In the
universities the youth neither are taught, nor always can find any
proper means of being taught, the sciences, which it is the business of
those incorporated bodies to teach. The reward of the schoolmaster in
most cases depends principally, in some cases almost entirely, upon the
fees or honoraries of his scholars. Schools have no exclusive
privileges. In order to obtain the honours of graduation, it is not
necessary that a person should bring a certificate of his having studied
 a certain number of years at a public school. If upon examination he
appears to understand what is taught there, no questions are asked about
 the place where he learnt it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_631"><span class="type-margin"><span>What the universities teach badly would not be commonly taught at all but for them.</span></span>The
 parts of education which are commonly taught in universities, it may,
perhaps, be said are not very well taught. But had it not been for those
 institutions they would not have been commonly taught at all, and both
the individual and the public would have suffered a good deal from the
want of those important parts of education.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_632"><span class="type-margin"><span>They were originally instituted for the education of churchmen in theology:</span></span>The
 present universities of Europe were originally, the greater part of
them, ecclesiastical corporations; instituted for the education of
churchmen. They were founded by the authority of the pope, and were so
entirely under his immediate protection, that their members, whether
masters or students, had all of them what was then called the benefit of
 clergy, that is, were exempted from the civil jurisdiction of the
countries in which their respective universities were situated, and were
 amenable only to the ecclesiastical tribunals. What was taught in the
greater part of those universities was suitable to the end of their
institution, either theology, or something that was merely preparatory
to theology.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_633"><span class="type-margin"><span>for this Latin was necessary,</span></span>When
 christianity was first established by law, a corrupted Latin had become
 the common language of all the western parts of Europe. The service of
the church accordingly, and the translation of the Bible <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>255<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 which was read in churches, were both in that corrupted Latin; that is,
 in the common language of the country. After the irruption of the
barbarous nations who overturned the Roman empire, Latin gradually
ceased to be the language of any part of Europe. But the reverence of
the people naturally preserves the established forms and ceremonies of
religion, long after the circumstances which first introduced and
rendered them reasonable are no more. Though Latin, therefore, was no
longer understood any where by the great body of the people, the whole
service of the church still continued to be performed in that language.
Two different languages were thus established in Europe, in the same
manner as in ancient Egypt; a language of the priests, and a language of
 the people; a sacred and a profane; a learned and an unlearned
language. But it was necessary that the priests should understand
something of that sacred and learned language in which they were to
officiate; and the study of the Latin language therefore made, from the
beginning, an essential part of university education.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_634">It was not so with that either of the Greek, or of the Hebrew<span class="type-margin"><span>but not Greek or Hebrew, which were introduced by the Reformation</span></span>
 language. The infallible decrees of the church had pronounced the Latin
 translation of the Bible, commonly called the Latin Vulgate, to have
been equally dictated by divine inspiration, and therefore of equal
authority with the Greek and Hebrew originals. The knowledge of those
two languages, therefore, not being indispensably requisite to a
churchman, the study of them did not for a long time make a necessary
part of the common course of university education. There are some
Spanish universities, I am assured, in which the study of the Greek
language has never yet made any part of that course. The first reformers
 found the Greek text of the new testament, and even the Hebrew text of
the old, more favourable to their opinions, than the vulgate
translation, which, as might naturally be supposed, had been gradually
accommodated to support the doctrines of the catholic church. They set
themselves, therefore, to expose the many errors of that translation,
which the Roman catholic clergy were thus put under the necessity of
defending or explaining. But this could not well be done without some
knowledge of the original languages, of which the study was therefore
gradually introduced into the greater part of universities; both of
those which embraced, and of those which rejected, the doctrines of the
reformation. The Greek language was connected with every part of that
classical learning, which, though at first principally cultivated by
catholics and Italians, happened to come into fashion much about the
same time that the doctrines of the reformation were set on foot. In the
 greater part of universities, therefore, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>256<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 that language was taught previous to the study of philosophy, and as
soon as the student had made some progress in the Latin. The Hebrew
language having no connection with classical learning, and, except the
holy scriptures, being the language of not a single book in any esteem,
the study of it did not commonly commence till after that of philosophy,
 and when the student had entered upon the study of theology.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_635"><span class="type-margin"><span>Greek and Latin continue to be a considerable part of university education</span></span>Originally
 the first rudiments both of the Greek and Latin languages were taught
in universities, and in some universities they still continue to be so.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt461" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt461_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 In others it is expected that the student should have previously
acquired at least the rudiments of one or both of those languages, of
which the study continues to make every where a very considerable part
of university education.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_636"><span class="type-margin"><span>There are three branches of Greek philosophy,</span></span>The
 ancient Greek philosophy was divided into three great branches;
physics, or natural philosophy; ethics, or moral philosophy; and logic.
This general division seems perfectly agreeable to the nature of things.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_637"><span class="type-margin"><span>(1) physics or natural philosophy,</span></span>The
 great phenomena of nature, the revolutions of the heavenly bodies,
eclipses, comets; thunder, lightning, and other extraordinary meteors;
the generation, the life, growth, and dissolution of plants and animals;
 are objects which, as they necessarily excite the wonder, so they
naturally<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt462" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt462_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 call forth the curiosity, of mankind to enquire into their causes.
Superstition first attempted to satisfy this curiosity, by referring all
 those wonderful appearances to the immediate agency of the gods.
Philosophy afterwards endeavoured to account for them, from more
familiar causes, or from such as mankind were better acquainted with,
than the agency of the gods. As those great phenomena are the first
objects of human curiosity, so the science which pretends to explain
them must naturally have been the first branch of philosophy that was
cultivated. The first philosophers, accordingly, of whom history has
preserved any account, appear to have been natural philosophers.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_638"><span class="type-margin"><span>(2) ethics or moral philosophy,</span></span>In
 every age and country of the world men must have attended to the
characters, designs, and actions of one another, and many reputable
rules and maxims for the conduct of human life, must have been laid down
 and approved of by common consent. As soon as writing came into
fashion, wise men, or those who fancied themselves such, would naturally
 endeavour to increase the number of those established and respected
maxims, and to express their own sense of what was either proper or
improper conduct, sometimes in the more artificial form of apologues,
like what are called the fables of Æsop; and sometimes <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>257<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 in the more simple one of apophthegms, or wise sayings, like the
Proverbs of Solomon, the verses of Theognis and Phocyllides, and some
part of the works of Hesiod. They might continue in this manner for a
long time merely to multiply the number of those maxims of prudence and
morality, without even attempting to arrange them in any very distinct
or methodical order, much less to connect them together by one or more
general principles, from which they were all deducible, like effects
from their natural causes. The beauty of a systematical arrangement of
different observations connected by a few common principles, was first
seen in the rude essays of those ancient times towards a system of
natural philosophy. Something of the same kind was afterwards attempted
in morals. The maxims of common life were arranged in some methodical
order, and connected together by a few common principles, in the same
manner as they had attempted to arrange and connect the phenomena of
nature. The science which pretends to investigate and explain those
connecting principles, is what is properly called moral philosophy.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_639">Different authors gave different systems both of natural and moral<span class="type-margin"><span>and (3) logic</span></span>
 philosophy. But the arguments by which they supported those different
systems, far from being always demonstrations, were frequently at best
but very slender probabilities, and sometimes mere sophisms, which had
no other foundation but the inaccuracy and ambiguity of common language.
 Speculative systems have in all ages of the world been adopted for
reasons too frivolous to have determined the judgment of any man of
common sense, in a matter of the smallest pecuniary interest. Gross
sophistry has scarce ever had any influence upon the opinions of
mankind, except in matters of philosophy and speculation; and in these
it has frequently had the greatest. The patrons of each system of
natural and moral philosophy naturally endeavoured to expose the
weakness of the arguments adduced to support the systems which were
opposite to their own. In examining those arguments, they were
necessarily led to consider the difference between a probable and a
demonstrative argument, between a fallacious and a conclusive one; and
Logic, or the science of the general principles of good and bad
reasoning, necessarily arose out of the observations which a scrutiny of
 this kind gave occasion to. Though in its origin, posterior both to
physics and to ethics, it was commonly taught, not indeed in all, but in
 the greater part of the ancient schools of philosophy, previously to
either of those sciences. The student, it seems to have been thought,
ought to understand well the difference between good and bad reasoning,
before he was led to reason upon subjects of so great importance.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>258<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_640"><span class="type-margin"><span>Philosophy was afterwards divided into five branches,</span></span>This
 ancient division of philosophy into three parts was in the greater part
 of the universities of Europe, changed for another into five.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_641"><span class="type-margin"><span>Metaphysics or pneumatics were added to physics,</span></span>In
 the ancient philosophy, whatever was taught concerning the nature
either of the human mind or of the Deity, made a part of the system of
physics. Those beings, in whatever their essence might be supposed to
consist, were parts of the great system of the universe, and parts too
productive of the most important effects. Whatever human reason could
either conclude, or conjecture, concerning them, made, as it were, two
chapters, though no doubt two very important ones, of the science which
pretended to give an account of the origin and revolutions of the great
system of the universe. But in the universities of Europe, where
philosophy was taught only as subservient to theology, it was natural to
 dwell longer upon these<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt463" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt463_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> two chapters than upon any other of the science. They were<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt464" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt464_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 gradually more and more extended, and were divided into many inferior
chapters, till at last the doctrine of spirits, of which so little can
be known, came to take up as much room in the system of philosophy as
the doctrine of bodies, of which so much can be known. The doctrines
concerning those two subjects were considered as making two distinct
sciences. What are called Metaphysics or Pneumatics were set in
opposition to Physics, and were cultivated<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt465" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt465_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 not only as the more sublime, but, for the purposes of a particular
profession, as the more useful science of the two. The proper subject of
 experiment and observation, a subject in which a careful attention is
capable of making so many useful discoveries, was almost entirely
neglected. The subject in which, after a few very simple and almost
obvious truths, the most careful attention can discover nothing but
obscurity and uncertainty, and can consequently produce nothing but
subtleties and sophisms, was greatly cultivated.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_642"><span class="type-margin"><span>and gave rise to Ontology.</span></span>When
 those two sciences had thus been set in opposition to one another, the
comparison between them naturally gave birth to a third, to what was
called Ontology, or the science which treated of the qualities and
attributes which were common to both the subjects of the other two
sciences. But if subtleties and sophisms composed the greater part of
the Metaphysics or Pneumatics of the schools, they composed the whole of
 this cobweb science of Ontology, which was likewise sometimes called
Metaphysics.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>259<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_643">Wherein consisted the happiness and perfection of a man, considered<span class="type-margin"><span>Moral philosophy degenerated into casuistry and an ascetic morality,</span></span>
 not only as an individual, but as the member of a family, of a state,
and of the great society of mankind, was the object which the ancient
moral philosophy proposed to investigate. In that philosophy the duties
of human life were treated of as subservient to the happiness and
perfection of human life. But when moral, as well as natural philosophy,
 came to be taught only as subservient to theology, the duties of human
life were treated of as chiefly subservient to the happiness of a life
to come. In the ancient philosophy the perfection of virtue was
represented as necessarily productive, to the person who possessed it,
of the most perfect happiness in this life. In the modern philosophy it
was frequently represented as generally, or rather as almost always
inconsistent with any degree of happiness in this life; and heaven was
to be earned only by penance and mortification, by the austerities and
abasement of a monk; not by the liberal, generous, and spirited conduct
of a man. Casuistry and an ascetic morality made up, in most cases, the
greater part of the moral philosophy of the schools. By far the most
important of all the different branches of philosophy, became in this
manner by far the most corrupted.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_644">Such, therefore, was the common course of philosophical education<span class="type-margin"><span>the order being (1) logic, (2) ontology, (3) pneumatology, (4) a debased moral philosophy, (5) physics,</span></span> in the greater part of the universities in<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt466" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt466_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Europe. Logic was taught first: Ontology came in the second place:
Pneumatology, comprehending the doctrine concerning the nature of the
human soul and of the Deity, in the third: In the fourth followed a
debased system of moral philosophy, which was considered as immediately
connected with the doctrines of Pneumatology, with the immortality of
the human soul, and with the rewards and punishments which, from the
justice of the Deity, were to be expected in a life to come: A short and
 superficial system of Physics usually concluded the course.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_645">The alterations which the universities of Europe thus introduced<span class="type-margin"><span>University education was thus made less likely to produce men of the world.</span></span>
 into the ancient course of philosophy, were all meant for the education
 of ecclesiastics, and to render it a more proper introduction to the
study of theology. But the additional quantity of subtlety and
sophistry; the casuistry and the ascetic morality which those
alterations introduced into it, certainly did not render it more proper
for the education of gentlemen or men of the world, or more likely
either to improve the understanding, or to mend the heart.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_646">This course of philosophy is what still continues to be taught in the<span class="type-margin"><span>This course is still taught in most universities with more or less diligence.</span></span>
 greater part of the universities of Europe; with more or less
diligence, according as the constitution of each particular university
happens to render diligence more or less necessary to the teachers. In
some of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>260<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 the richest and best endowed universities, the tutors content
themselves with teaching a few unconnected shreds and parcels of this
corrupted course; and even these they commonly teach very negligently
and superficially.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_647"><span class="type-margin"><span>Few improvements in philosophy have been made by universities, and fewest by the richest universities.</span></span>The
 improvements which, in modern times, have been made in several
different branches of philosophy, have not, the greater part of them,
been made in universities; though some no doubt have. The greater part
of universities have not even been very forward to adopt those
improvements, after they were made; and several of those learned
societies have chosen to remain, for a long time, the sanctuaries in
which exploded systems and obsolete prejudices found shelter and
protection, after they had been hunted out of every other corner of the
world. In general, the richest and best endowed universities have been
the slowest in adopting those improvements, and the most averse to
permit any considerable change in the established plan of education.
Those improvements were more easily introduced into some of the poorer
universities, in which the teachers, depending upon their reputation for
 the greater part of their subsistence, were obliged to pay more
attention to the current opinions of the world.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt467" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt467_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_648"><span class="type-margin"><span>In spite of all this the universities drew to themselves the education of gentlemen and men of fortune,</span></span>But
 though the public schools and universities of Europe were originally
intended only for the education of a particular profession, that of
churchmen; and though they were not always very diligent in instructing
their pupils even in the sciences which were supposed necessary for that
 profession, yet they gradually drew to themselves the education of
almost all other people, particularly of almost all gentlemen and men of
 fortune. No better method, it seems, could be fallen upon of spending,
with any advantage, the long interval between infancy and that period of
 life at which men begin to apply in good earnest to the real business
of the world, the business which is to employ them during the remainder
of their days. The greater part of what is taught in schools and
universities, however, does not seem to be the most proper preparation
for that business.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_649"><span class="type-margin"><span>but in England
 it is becoming more usual to send young men to travel abroad, a plan so
 absurd that nothing but the discredit of the universities could have
brought it into repute.</span></span>In England, it becomes every day
more and more the custom to send young people to travel in foreign
countries immediately upon their leaving school, and without sending
them to any university. Our young people, it is said, generally return
home much improved by their travels. A young man who goes abroad at
seventeen or eighteen, and returns home at one and twenty, returns three
 or four years older than he was when he went abroad; and at that age it
 is very difficult not to improve a good deal in three or four years. In
 <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>261<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 the course of his travels, he generally acquires some knowledge of one
or two foreign languages; a knowledge, however, which is seldom
sufficient to enable him either to speak or write them with propriety.
In other respects, he commonly returns home more conceited, more
unprincipled, more dissipated, and more incapable of any serious
application either to study or to business, than he could well have
become in so short a time, had he lived at home. By travelling so very
young, by spending in the most frivolous dissipation the most precious
years of his life, at a distance from the inspection and controul of his
 parents and relations, every useful habit, which the earlier parts of
his education might have had some tendency to form in him, instead of
being rivetted and confirmed, is almost necessarily either weakened or
effaced. Nothing but the discredit into which the universities are
allowing themselves to fall, could ever have brought into repute so very
 absurd a practice as that of travelling at this early period of life.
By sending his son abroad, a father delivers himself, at least for some
time, from so disagreeable an object as that of a son unemployed,
neglected, and going to ruin before his eyes.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_650">Such have been the effects of some of the modern institutions for education.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_651">Different plans and different institutions for education seem to have taken place in other ages and nations.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_652">In the republics of ancient Greece, every free citizen was instructed,<span class="type-margin"><span>In Greece the state directed education in gymnastics and music</span></span>
 under the direction of the public magistrate, in gymnastic exercises
and in music. By gymnastic exercises it was intended to harden his body,
 to sharpen his courage, and to prepare him for the fatigues and dangers
 of war; and as the Greek militia was, by all accounts, one of the best
that ever was in the world, this part of their public education must
have answered completely the purpose for which it was intended. By the
other part, music, it was proposed, at least by the philosophers and
historians who have given us an account of those institutions, to
humanize the mind, to soften the temper, and to dispose it for
performing all the social and moral duties both of public and private
life.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_653">In ancient Rome the exercises of the Campus Martius answered the<span class="type-margin"><span>The Romans had the Campus Martius, resembling the gymnasium, but no music. They were none the worse for its absence</span></span> same purpose as those of the Gymnazium in ancient Greece,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt468" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt468_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 and they seem to have answered it equally well. But among the Romans
there was nothing which corresponded to the musical education of the
Greeks. The morals of the Romans, however, both in private and public
life, seem to have been, not only equal, but, upon the whole, a good
deal superior to those of the Greeks. That they were superior in private
 <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>262<span class="bracket">]</span></span> life, we have the express testimony of Polybius<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt469" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt469_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> and of Dionysius of Halicarnassus,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt470" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt470_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 two authors well acquainted with both nations; and the whole tenor of
the Greek and Roman history bears witness to the superiority of the
public morals of the Romans. The good temper and moderation of
contending factions seems to be the most essential circumstance in the
public morals of a free people. But the factions of the Greeks were
almost always violent and sanguinary; whereas, till the time of the
Gracchi, no blood had ever been shed in any Roman faction; and from the
time of the Gracchi the Roman republic may be considered as in reality
dissolved. Notwithstanding, therefore, the very respectable authority of
 Plato,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt471" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt471_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> Aristotle,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt472" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt472_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> and Polybius,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt473" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt473_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a> and notwithstanding the very ingenious reasons by which Mr. Montesquieu endeavours to support that authority,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt474" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt474_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">6</a>
 it seems probable that the musical education of the Greeks had no great
 effect in mending their morals, since, without any such education,
those of the Romans were upon the whole superior. The respect of those
ancient sages for the institutions of their ancestors, had probably
disposed them to find much political wisdom in what was, perhaps, merely
 an ancient custom, continued, without interruption, from the earliest
period of those societies, to the times in which they had arrived at a
considerable degree of refinement. Music and dancing are the great
amusements of almost all barbarous nations, and the great
accomplishments which are supposed to fit any man for entertaining his
society. It is so at this day among the negroes on the coast of Africa.
It was so among the ancient Celtes, among the ancient Scandinavians,
and, as we may learn from Homer, among the ancient Greeks in the times
preceding the Trojan war.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt475" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt475_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">7</a>
 When the Greek tribes had formed themselves into little republics, it
was natural that the study of those accomplishments should, for a long
time, make a part of the public and common education of the people.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_654"><span class="type-margin"><span>The teachers of military exercises and music were not paid or appointed by the state.</span></span>The
 masters who instructed the young people either in music or in military
exercises, do not seem to have been paid, or even appointed by the
state, either in Rome or even in Athens, the Greek republic of whose
laws and customs we are the best informed. The state required that every
 free citizen should fit himself for defending it in war, and should,
upon that account, learn his military exercises. But it left him to
learn them of such masters as he could find, and it seems to have <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>263<span class="bracket">]</span></span> advanced nothing for this purpose, but a public field or place of exercise, in which he should practise and perform them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_655">In the early ages both of the Greek and Roman republics, the other<span class="type-margin"><span>Reading, writing and arithmetic were taught privately.</span></span>
 parts of education seem to have consisted in learning to read, write,
and account according to the arithmetic of the times. These
accomplishments the richer citizens seem frequently to have acquired at
home, by the assistance of some domestic pedagogue, who was generally,
either a slave, or a freed-man; and the poorer citizens, in the schools
of such masters as made a trade of teaching for hire. Such parts of
education, however, were abandoned altogether to the care of the parents
 or guardians of each individual. It does not appear that the state ever
 assumed any inspection or direction of them. By a law of Solon, indeed,
 the children were acquitted from maintaining those parents in their old
 age,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt476" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt476_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> who had neglected to instruct them in some profitable trade or business.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt477" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt477_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_656">In the progress of refinement, when philosophy and rhetoric came<span class="type-margin"><span>Philosophical education was independent of the state</span></span>
 into fashion, the better sort of people used to send their children to
the schools of philosophers and rhetoricians, in order to be instructed
in these fashionable sciences. But those schools were not supported by
the public. They were for a long time barely tolerated by it. The demand
 for philosophy and rhetoric was for a long time so small, that the
first professed teachers of either could not find constant employment in
 any one city, but were obliged to travel about from place to place. In
this manner lived Zeno of Elea, Protagoras, Gorgias, Hippias, and many
others. As the demand increased, the schools both of philosophy and
rhetoric became stationary; first in Athens, and afterwards in several
other cities. The state, however, seems never to have encouraged them
further than by assigning to some of them a particular place to teach
in, which was sometimes done too by private donors. The state seems to
have assigned the Academy to Plato, the Lyceum to Aristotle, and the
Portico to Zeno of Citta, the founder of the Stoics. But Epicurus
bequeathed his gardens to his own school. Till about the time of Marcus
Antoninus, however, no teacher appears to have had any salary from the
public, or to have had any other emoluments, but what arose from the
honoraries or fees of his scholars. The bounty which that philosophical
emperor, as we learn from Lucian, bestowed upon one of<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt478" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt478_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> the teachers of philosophy, probably <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>264<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 lasted no longer than his own life. There was nothing equivalent to the
 privileges of graduation, and to have attended any of those schools was
 not necessary, in order to be permitted to practise any particular
trade or profession. If the opinion of their own utility could not draw
scholars to them, the law neither forced any body to go to them, nor
rewarded any body for having gone to them. The teachers had no
jurisdiction over their pupils, nor any other authority besides that
natural authority, which superior virtue and abilities never fail to
procure from young people towards those who are entrusted with any part
of their education.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_657"><span class="type-margin"><span>No public institutions for teaching law existed at Rome, where law was first developed into an orderly system.</span></span>At
 Rome, the study of the civil law made a part of the education, not of
the greater part of the citizens, but of some particular families. The
young people, however, who wished to acquire knowledge in the law, had
no public school to go to, and had no other method of studying it, than
by frequenting the company of such of their relations and friends, as
were supposed to understand it. It is perhaps worth while to remark,
that though the laws of the twelve tables were, many of them, copied
from those of some ancient Greek republics, yet law never seems to have
grown up to be a science in any republic of ancient Greece. In Rome it
became a science very early, and gave a considerable degree of
illustration to those citizens who had the reputation of understanding
it. In the republics of ancient Greece, particularly in Athens, the
ordinary courts of justice consisted of numerous, and therefore
disorderly, bodies of people, who frequently decided almost at random,
or as clamour, faction and party spirit happened to determine. The
ignominy of an unjust decision, when it was to be divided among five
hundred, a thousand, or fifteen hundred people (for some of their courts
 were so very numerous), could not fall very heavy upon any individual.
At Rome, on the contrary, the principal courts of justice consisted
either of a single judge, or of a small number of judges, whose
characters, especially as they deliberated always in public, could not
fail to be very much affected by any rash or unjust decision. In
doubtful cases, such courts, from their anxiety to avoid blame, would
naturally endeavour to shelter themselves under the example, or
precedent, of the judges who had sat before them, either in the same, or
 in some other court. This attention to practice and precedent,
necessarily formed the Roman law into that regular and orderly system in
 which it has been delivered down to us; and the like attention has had
the like effects upon the laws of every other country where such
attention has taken place. The superiority of character in the Romans
over that of the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>265<span class="bracket">]</span></span> Greeks, so much remarked by Polybius and Dionysius of Halicarnassus,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt479" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt479_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 was probably more owing to the better constitution of their courts of
justice, than to any of the circumstances to which those authors ascribe
 it. The Romans are said to have been particularly distinguished for
their superior respect to an oath. But the people who were accustomed to
 make oath only before some diligent and well-informed court of justice,
 would naturally be much more attentive to what they swore, than they
who were accustomed to do the same thing before mobbish and disorderly
assemblies.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_658">The abilities, both civil and military, of the Greeks and Romans,<span class="type-margin"><span>The ancient system was more successful than the modern, which corrupts public teaching and stifles private</span></span>
 will readily be allowed to have been, at least, equal to those of any
modern nation. Our prejudice is perhaps rather to overrate them. But
except in what related to military exercises, the state seems to have
been at no pains to form those great abilities: for I cannot be induced
to believe, that the musical education of the Greeks could be of much
consequence in forming them. Masters, however, had been found, it seems,
 for instructing the better sort of people among those nations in every
art and science in which the circumstances of their society rendered it
necessary or convenient for them to be instructed. The demand for such
instruction produced, what it always produces, the talent for giving it;
 and the emulation which an unrestrained competition never fails to
excite, appears to have brought that talent to a very high degree of
perfection. In the attention which the ancient philosophers excited, in
the empire which they acquired over the opinions and principles of their
 auditors, in the faculty which they possessed of giving a certain tone
and character to the conduct and conversation of those auditors; they
appear to have been much superior to any modern teachers. In modern
times, the diligence of public teachers is more or less corrupted by the
 circumstances, which render them more or less independent of their
success and reputation in their particular professions. Their salaries
too put the private teacher, who would pretend to come into competition
with them, in the same state with a merchant who attempts to trade
without a bounty, in competition with those who trade with a
considerable one. If he sells his goods at nearly the same price, he
cannot have the same profit, and poverty and beggary at least, if not
bankruptcy and ruin will infallibly be his lot. If he attempts to sell
them much dearer, he is likely to have so few customers that his
circumstances will not be much mended. The privileges of graduation,
besides, are in many countries necessary, or at least extremely
convenient to most <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>266<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 men of learned professions; that is, to the far greater part of those
who have occasion for a learned education. But those privileges can be
obtained only by attending the lectures of the public teachers. The most
 careful attendance upon the ablest instructions of any private teacher,
 cannot always give any title to demand them. It is from these different
 causes that the private teacher of any of the sciences which are
commonly taught in universities, is in modern times generally considered
 as in the very lowest order of men of letters. A man of real abilities
can scarce find out a more humiliating or a more unprofitable employment
 to turn them to. The endowments of schools and colleges have, in this
manner, not only corrupted the diligence of public teachers, but have
rendered it almost impossible to have any good private ones.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_659"><span class="type-margin"><span>If there were no public institutions for education nothing except what was useful would be taught</span></span>Were
 there no public institutions for education, no system, no science would
 be taught for which there was not some demand; or which the
circumstances of the times did not render it either necessary, or
convenient, or at least fashionable, to learn. A private teacher could
never find his account in teaching, either an exploded and antiquated
system of a science acknowledged to be useful, or a science universally
believed to be a mere useless and pedantic heap of sophistry and
nonsense. Such systems, such sciences, can subsist no where, but in
those incorporated societies for education whose prosperity and revenue
are in a great measure independent of their reputation, and altogether
independent of their industry. Were there no public institutions for
education, a gentleman, after going through, with application and
abilities, the most complete course of education which the circumstances
 of the times were supposed to afford, could not come into the world
completely ignorant of every thing which is the common subject of
conversation among gentlemen and men of the world.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_660"><span class="type-margin"><span>Women’s education is excellent in consequence of the absence of public institutions</span></span>There
 are no public institutions for the education of women, and there is
accordingly nothing useless, absurd, or fantastical in the common course
 of their education. They are taught what their parents or guardians
judge it necessary or useful for them to learn; and they are taught
nothing else. Every part of their education tends evidently to some
useful purpose; either to improve the natural attractions of their
person, or to form their mind to reserve, to modesty, to chastity, and
to œconomy; to render them both likely to become the mistresses of a
family, and to behave properly when they have become such. In every part
 of her life a woman feels some conveniency or advantage from every part
 of her education. It seldom happens that a man, in any part of his
life, derives any conveniency or advantage <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>267<span class="bracket">]</span></span> from some of the most laborious and troublesome parts of his education.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_661">Ought the public, therefore, to give no attention, it may be asked,<span class="type-margin"><span>Ought the state to give no attention to education?</span></span>
 to the education of the people? Or if it ought to give any, what are
the different parts of education which it ought to attend to in the

 them?</p>

without any attention of government, almost all the abilities and
virtues which that state requires, or perhaps can admit of. In other
cases the state of the society does not place the greater part of
individuals in such situations, and some attention of government is
necessary in order to prevent the almost entire corruption and
degeneracy of the great body of the people.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_663">In the progress of the division of labour, the employment of the far<span class="type-margin"><span>Division of labour destroys intellectual, social and martial virtues unless government takes pains to prevent it,</span></span>
 greater part of those who live by labour, that is, of the great body of
 the people, comes to be confined to a few very simple operations;
frequently to one or two. But the understandings of the greater part of
men are necessarily formed by their ordinary employments. The man whose
whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations, of which the
effects too are, perhaps, always the same, or very nearly the same, has
no occasion to exert his understanding, or to exercise his invention in
finding out expedients for removing difficulties which never occur. He
naturally loses, therefore, the habit of such exertion, and generally
becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to
 become. The torpor of his mind renders him, not only incapable of
relishing or bearing a part in any rational conversation, but of
conceiving any generous, noble, or tender sentiment, and consequently of
 forming any just judgment concerning many even of the ordinary duties
of private life. Of the great and extensive interests of his country he
is altogether incapable of judging; and unless very particular pains
have been taken to render him otherwise, he is equally incapable of
defending his country in war. The uniformity of his stationary life
naturally corrupts the courage of his mind, and makes him regard with
abhorrence the irregular, uncertain, and adventurous life of a soldier.
It corrupts even the activity of his body, and renders him incapable of
exerting his strength with vigour and perseverance, in any other
employment than that to which he has been bred. His dexterity at his own
 particular trade seems, in this manner, to be acquired at the expence
of his intellectual, social, and martial virtues. <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>268<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 But in every improved and civilized society this is the state into
which the labouring poor, that is, the great body of the people, must
necessarily fall, unless government takes some pains to prevent it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_664"><span class="type-margin"><span>whereas in barbarous societies those virtues are kept alive by constant necessity.</span></span>It
 is otherwise in the barbarous societies, as they are commonly called,
of hunters, of shepherds, and even of husbandmen in that rude state of
husbandry which precedes the improvement of manufactures, and the
extension of foreign commerce. In such societies the varied occupations
of every man oblige every man to exert his capacity, and to invent
expedients for removing difficulties which are continually occurring.
Invention is kept alive, and the mind is not<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt480" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt480_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 suffered to fall into that drowsy stupidity, which, in a civilized
society, seems to benumb the understanding of almost all the inferior
ranks of people. In those barbarous societies, as they are called, every
 man, it has already been observed, is a warrior. Every man too is in
some measure a statesman, and can form a tolerable judgment concerning
the interest of the society, and the conduct of those who govern it. How
 far their chiefs are good judges in peace, or good leaders in war, is
obvious to the observation of almost every single man among them. In
such a society indeed, no man can well acquire that improved and refined
 understanding, which a few men sometimes possess in a more civilized
state. Though in a rude society there is a good deal of variety in the
occupations of every individual, there is not a great deal in those of
the whole society. Every man does, or is capable of doing, almost every
thing which any other man does, or is capable of doing. Every man has a
considerable degree of knowledge, ingenuity, and invention; but scarce
any man has a great degree. The degree, however, which is commonly
possessed, is generally sufficient for conducting the whole simple
business of the society. In a civilized state, on the contrary, though
there is little variety in the occupations of the greater part of
individuals, there is an almost infinite variety in those of the whole
society. These varied occupations present an almost infinite variety of
objects to the contemplation of those few, who, being attached to no
particular occupation themselves, have leisure and inclination to
examine the occupations of other people. The contemplation of so great a
 variety of objects necessarily exercises their minds in endless
comparisons and combinations, and renders their understandings, in an
extraordinary degree, both acute and comprehensive. Unless those few,
however, happen to be placed in some very particular situations, their
great abilities, though honourable to themselves, may contribute very
little to the good government or happiness <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>269<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of their society. Notwithstanding the great abilities of those few, all
 the nobler parts of the human character may be, in a great measure,
obliterated and extinguished in the great body of the people.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_665">The education of the common people requires, perhaps, in a civilized<span class="type-margin"><span>The
 education of the common people requires attention from the state more
than that of people of rank and fortune, whose parents can look after
their interests, and who spend their lives in varied occupations chiefly
 intellectual,</span></span> and commercial society, the attention of
the public more than that of people of some rank and fortune. People of
some rank and fortune are generally eighteen or nineteen years of age
before they enter upon that particular business, profession, or trade,
by which they propose to distinguish themselves in the world. They have
before that full time to acquire, or at least to fit themselves for
afterwards acquiring, every accomplishment which can recommend them to
the public esteem, or render them worthy of it. Their parents or
guardians are generally sufficiently anxious that they should be so
accomplished, and are, in most cases, willing enough to lay out the
expence which is necessary for that purpose. If they are not always
properly educated, it is seldom from the want of expence laid out upon
their education; but from the improper application of that expence. It
is seldom from the want of masters; but from the negligence and
incapacity of the masters who are to be had, and from the difficulty, or
 rather from the impossibility which there is, in the present state of
things, of finding any better. The employments too in which people of
some rank or fortune spend the greater part of their lives, are not,
like those of the common people, simple and uniform. They are almost all
 of them extremely complicated, and such as exercise the head more than
the hands. The understandings of those who are engaged in such
employments can seldom grow torpid for<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt481" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt481_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 want of exercise. The employments of people of some rank and fortune,
besides, are seldom such as harass them from morning to night. They
generally have a good deal of leisure, during which they may perfect
themselves in every branch either of useful or ornamental knowledge of
which they may have laid the foundation, or for which they may have
acquired some taste in the earlier part of life.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_666">It is otherwise with the common people. They have little time to<span class="type-margin"><span>unlike the children of the poor.</span></span>
 spare for education. Their parents can scarce afford to maintain them
even in infancy. As soon as they are able to work, they must apply to
some trade by which they can earn their subsistence. That trade too is
generally so simple and uniform as to give little exercise to the
understanding; while, at the same time, their labour is both so constant
 and so severe, that it leaves them little leisure and less inclination
to apply to, or even to think of any thing else.</p>

<p id="Smith_0206-02_667"><span class="type-margin"><span>The state can encourage or insist on the general acquirement of reading, writing, and arithmetic,</span></span>But
 though the common people cannot, in any civilized society, be so well
instructed as people of some rank and fortune, the most essential parts
of education, however, to read, write, and account, can be acquired at
so early a period of life, that the greater part even of those who are
to be bred to the lowest occupations, have time to acquire them before
they can be employed in those occupations. For a very small expence the
public can facilitate, can encourage, and can even impose upon almost
the whole body of the people, the necessity of acquiring those most
essential parts of education.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_668"><span class="type-margin"><span>by establishing parish schools,</span></span>The
 public can facilitate this acquisition by establishing in every parish
or district a little school, where children may be taught for a reward
so moderate, that even a common labourer may afford it; the master being
 partly, but not wholly paid by the public; because, if he was wholly,
or even principally paid by it, he would soon learn to neglect his
business. In Scotland the establishment of such parish schools has
taught almost the whole common people to read, and a very great
proportion of them to write and account. In England the establishment of
 charity schools has had an effect of the same kind, though not so
universally, because the establishment is not so universal. If in those
little schools the books, by which the children are taught to read, were
 a little more instructive than they commonly are; and if, instead of a<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt482" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt482_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 little smattering of Latin, which the children of the common people are
 sometimes taught there, and which can scarce ever be of any use to
them; they were instructed in the elementary parts of geometry and
mechanics, the literary education of this rank of people would perhaps
be as complete as it can be.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt483" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt483_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 There is scarce a common trade which does not afford some opportunities
 of applying to it the principles of geometry and mechanics, and which
would not therefore gradually exercise and improve the common people in
those principles, the necessary introduction to the most sublime as well
 as to the most useful sciences.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_669"><span class="type-margin"><span>giving prizes,</span></span>The
 public can encourage the acquisition of those most essential parts of
education by giving small premiums, and little badges of distinction, to

 public can impose upon almost the whole body of the people the
necessity of acquiring those most essential parts of education, by
obliging every man to undergo an examination or probation in them before
 he can obtain the freedom in any corporation, or be allowed to set up
any trade either in a village or town corporate.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>271<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_671">It was in this manner, by facilitating the acquisition of their military<span class="type-margin"><span>In this way the Greeks and Romans maintained a martial spirit</span></span>
 and gymnastic exercises, by encouraging it, and even by imposing upon
the whole body of the people the necessity of learning those exercises,
that the Greek and Roman republics maintained the martial spirit of
their respective citizens. They facilitated the acquisition of those
exercises by appointing a certain place for learning and practising
them, and by granting to certain masters the privilege of teaching in
that place. Those masters do not appear to have had either salaries or
exclusive privileges of any kind. Their reward consisted altogether in
what they got from their scholars; and a citizen who had learnt his
exercises in the public Gymnasia, had no sort of legal advantage over
one who had learnt them privately, provided the latter had learnt them
equally well. Those republics encouraged the acquisition of those
exercises, by bestowing little premiums and badges of distinction upon
those who excelled in them. To have gained a prize in the Olympic,
Isthmian or Nemæan games gave illustration, not only to the person who
gained it, but to his whole family and kindred. The obligation which
every citizen was under to serve a certain number of years, if called
upon, in the armies of the republic, sufficiently imposed the necessity
of learning those exercises without which he could not be fit for that
service.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_672">That in the progress of improvement the practice of military exercises,<span class="type-margin"><span>Martial spirit in the people would diminish both the necessary size and the danger of a standing army.</span></span>
 unless government takes proper pains to support it, goes gradually to
decay, and, together with it, the martial spirit of the great body of
the people, the example of modern Europe sufficiently demonstrates. But
the security of every society must always depend, more or less, upon the
 martial spirit of the great body of the people. In the present times,
indeed, that martial spirit alone, and unsupported by a well-disciplined
 standing army, would not, perhaps, be sufficient for the defence and
security of any society. But where every citizen had the spirit of a
soldier, a smaller standing army would surely be requisite. That spirit,
 besides, would necessarily diminish very much the dangers to liberty,
whether real or imaginary, which are commonly apprehended from a
standing army. As it would very much facilitate the operations of that
army against a foreign invader, so it would obstruct them as much if
unfortunately they should ever be directed against the constitution of
the state.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_673">The ancient institutions of Greece and Rome seem to have been<span class="type-margin"><span>The Greek and Roman institutions were more effectual than modern militias, which only include a small portion of the people.</span></span>
 much more effectual, for maintaining the martial spirit of the great
body of the people, than the establishment of what are called the
militias of modern times. They were much more simple. When they <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>272<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 were once established, they executed themselves, and it required little
 or no attention from government to maintain them in the most perfect
vigour. Whereas to maintain, even in tolerable execution, the complex
regulations of any modern militia, requires the continual and painful
attention of government, without which they are constantly falling into
total neglect and disuse. The influence, besides, of the ancient
institutions was much more universal. By means of them the whole body of
 the people was completely instructed in the use of arms. Whereas it is
but a very small part of them who can ever be so instructed by the
regulations of any modern militia; except, perhaps, that of Switzerland.<span class="type-margin"><span>It is the duty of government to prevent the growth of cowardice,</span></span>
 But a coward, a man incapable either of defending or of revenging
himself, evidently wants one of the most essential parts of the
character of a man. He is as much mutilated and deformed in his mind as
another is in his body, who is either deprived of some of its most
essential members, or has lost the use of them.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt484" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt484_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 He is evidently the more wretched and miserable of the two; because
happiness and misery, which reside altogether in the mind, must
necessarily depend more upon the healthful or unhealthful, the mutilated
 or entire state of the mind, than upon that of the body. Even though
the martial spirit of the people were of no use towards the defence of
the society, yet to prevent that sort of mental mutilation, deformity,
and wretchedness, which cowardice necessarily involves in it, from
spreading themselves through the great body of the people, would still
deserve the most serious attention of government; in the same manner as
it would deserve its most serious attention to prevent a leprosy or any
other loathsome and offensive disease, though neither mortal nor
dangerous, from spreading itself among them; though, perhaps, no other
public good might result from such attention besides the prevention of
so great a public evil.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_674"><span class="type-margin"><span>gross ignorance and stupidity.</span></span>The
 same thing may be said of the gross ignorance and stupidity which, in a
 civilized society, seem so frequently to benumb the understandings of
all the inferior ranks of people. A man without the proper use of the
intellectual faculties of a man, is, if possible, more contemptible than
 even a coward, and seems to be mutilated and deformed in a still more
essential part of the character of human nature. Though the state was to
 derive no advantage from the instruction of the inferior ranks of
people, it would still deserve its attention that they should not be
altogether uninstructed. The state, however, derives no inconsiderable
advantage from their instruction. The more they are instructed, the less
 liable they are to the delusions <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>273<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of enthusiasm and superstition, which, among ignorant nations,
frequently occasion the most dreadful disorders. An instructed and
intelligent people besides, are always more decent and orderly than an
ignorant and stupid one. They feel themselves, each individually, more
respectable, and more likely to obtain the respect of their lawful
superiors, and they are therefore more disposed to respect those
superiors. They are more disposed to examine, and more capable of seeing
 through, the interested complaints of faction and sedition, and they
are, upon that account, less apt to be misled into any wanton or
unnecessary opposition to the measures of government. In free countries,
 where the safety of government depends very much upon the favourable
judgment which the people may form of its conduct, it must surely be of
the highest importance that they should not be disposed to judge rashly
or capriciously concerning it.</p>

<h2 id="lf0206-02_label_545"><span class="csc">Article</span> III: <span class="ital">Of the Expence of the Institutions for the Instruction of People of all Ages</span></h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-02_675">THE institutions for the instruction of people of all ages are chiefly<span class="type-margin"><span>These
 institutions are chiefly for religious instruction. Religious like
other teachers are more vigorous if unestablished and unendowed</span></span>
 those for religious instruction. This is a species of instruction of
which the object is not so much to render the people good citizens in
this world, as to prepare them for another and a better world in a life
to come. The teachers of the doctrine which contains this instruction,
in the same manner as other teachers, may either depend altogether for
their subsistence upon the voluntary contributions of their hearers; or
they may derive it from some other fund to which the law of their
country may entitle them; such as a landed estate, a tythe or land tax,
an established salary or stipend. Their exertion, their zeal and
industry, are likely to be much greater in the former situation than in
the latter. In this respect the teachers of new religions have always
had a considerable advantage in attacking those ancient and established
systems of which the clergy, reposing themselves upon their benefices,
had neglected to keep up the fervour of faith and devotion in the great
body of the people; and having given themselves up to indolence, were
become altogether incapable of making any vigorous exertion in defence
even of their own establishment. The clergy of an established and
well-endowed religion frequently become men of learning and elegance,
who possess all the virtues of gentlemen, or which can recommend them to
 the esteem <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>274<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of gentlemen; but they are apt gradually to lose the qualities, both
good and bad, which gave them authority and influence with the inferior
ranks of people, and which had perhaps been the original causes of the
success and establishment of their religion. Such a clergy, when
attacked by a set of popular and bold, though perhaps stupid and
ignorant enthusiasts, feel themselves as perfectly defenceless as the
indolent, effeminate, and full-fed nations of the southern parts of
Asia, when they were invaded by the active, hardy, and hungry Tartars of
 the North. Such a clergy, upon such an emergency, have commonly no
other resource than to call upon the civil magistrate to persecute,
destroy, or drive out their adversaries, as disturbers of the public
peace. It was thus that the Roman catholic clergy called upon the civil
magistrate to persecute the protestants; and the church of England, to
persecute the dissenters; and that in general every religious sect, when
 it has once enjoyed for a century or two the security of a legal
establishment, has found itself incapable of making any vigorous defence
 against any new sect which chose to attack its doctrine or discipline.
Upon such occasions the advantage in point of learning and good writing
may sometimes be on the side of the established church. But the arts of
popularity, all the arts of gaining proselytes, are constantly on the
side of its adversaries. In England those arts have been long neglected
by the well-endowed clergy of the established church, and are at present
 chiefly cultivated by the dissenters and by the methodists. The
independent provisions, however, which in many places have been made for
 dissenting teachers, by means of voluntary subscriptions, of trust
rights, and other evasions of the law, seem very much to have abated the
 zeal and activity of those teachers. They have many of them become very
 learned, ingenious, and respectable men; but they have in general
ceased to be very popular preachers. The methodists, without half the
learning of the dissenters, are much more in vogue.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_676"><span class="type-margin"><span>The inferior clergy of the Church of Rome are more stimulated by self-interest than those of any established Protestant Church.</span></span>In the church of Rome, the industry and zeal of the inferior clergy are<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt485" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt485_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 kept more alive by the powerful motive of self-interest, than perhaps
in any established protestant church. The parochial clergy derive, many
of them, a very considerable part of their subsistence from the
voluntary oblations of the people; a source of revenue which confession
gives them many opportunities of improving. The mendicant orders derive
their whole subsistence from such oblations. It is with them, as with
the hussars and light infantry of some armies; no plunder, no pay. The
parochial clergy are like those teachers whose reward depends partly
upon their salary, and partly upon the fees or honoraries <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>275<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 which they get from their pupils; and these must always depend more or
less upon their industry and reputation. The mendicant orders are like
those teachers whose subsistence depends altogether upon their industry.
 They are obliged, therefore, to use every art which can animate the
devotion of the common people. The establishment of the two great
mendicant orders of St. Dominic and St. Francis, it is observed by
Machiavel,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt486" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt486_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 revived, in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the languishing
faith and devotion of the catholic church. In Roman catholic countries
the spirit of devotion is supported altogether by the monks and by the
poorer parochial clergy. The great dignitaries of the church, with all
the accomplishments of gentlemen and men of the world, and sometimes
with those of men of learning, are careful enough to maintain the
necessary discipline over their inferiors, but seldom give themselves
any trouble about the instruction of the people.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_677">“Most of the arts and professions in a state,” says by far the most<span class="type-margin"><span>Hume says the state may leave the promotion of some arts to individuals who benefit by them,</span></span>
 illustrious philosopher and historian of the present age, “are of such a
 nature, that, while they promote the interests of the society, they are
 also useful or agreeable to some individuals; and in that case, the
constant rule of the magistrate, except, perhaps, on the first
introduction of any art, is, to leave the profession to itself, and
trust its encouragement to the individuals who reap the benefit of it.
The artizans, finding their profits to rise by the favour of their
customers, increase, as much as possible, their skill and industry; and
as matters are not disturbed by any injudicious tampering, the commodity
 is always sure to be at all times nearly proportioned to the demand.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_678">“But there are also some callings, which, though useful and even<span class="type-margin"><span>others must be promoted by the state,</span></span>
 necessary in a state, bring no advantage or pleasure to any individual,
 and the supreme power is obliged to alter its conduct with regard to
the retainers of those professions. It must give them public
encouragement in order to their subsistence; and it must provide against
 that negligence to which they will naturally be subject, either by
annexing particular honours to the profession, by establishing a long
subordination of ranks and a strict dependance, or by some other
expedient. The persons employed in the finances, fleets,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt487" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt487_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> and magistracy, are instances of this order of men.</p>

 liberality of individuals, who are attached to their doctrines, and who
 find benefit or consolation from their spiritual ministry and

such an additional motive; and their skill in the profession, as well as
 their address in governing the minds of the people, must receive daily

<p id="Smith_0206-02_680"><span class="type-margin"><span>but it does not, because the interested zeal of the clergy should be discouraged.</span></span>“But
 if we consider the matter more closely, we shall find, that this
interested diligence of the clergy is what every wise legislator will
study to prevent; because, in every religion except the true, it is
highly pernicious, and it has even a natural tendency to pervert the
true, by infusing into it a strong mixture of superstition, folly, and
delusion. Each ghostly practitioner, in order to render himself more
precious and sacred in the eyes of his retainers, will inspire them with
 the most violent abhorrence of all other sects, and continually
endeavour, by some novelty, to excite the languid devotion of his
audience. No regard will be paid to truth, morals, or decency in the
doctrines inculcated. Every tenet will be adopted that best suits the
disorderly affections of the human frame. Customers will be drawn to
each conventicle by new industry and address in practising on the
passions and credulity of the populace. And in the end, the civil
magistrate will find, that he has dearly paid for his pretended
frugality, in saving a fixed establishment for the priests; and that in
reality the most decent and advantageous composition, which he can make
with the spiritual guides, is to bribe their indolence, by assigning
stated salaries to their profession, and rendering it superfluous for
them to be farther active, than merely to prevent their flock from
straying in quest of new pastures. And in this manner ecclesiastical
establishments, though commonly they arose at first from religious
views, prove in the end advantageous to the political interests of
society.”<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt488" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt488_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_681"><span class="type-margin"><span>Establishments and public endowments have not been due to reasoning like this, but to the needs of political faction.</span></span>But
 whatever may have been the good or bad effects of the independent
provision of the clergy; it has, perhaps, been very seldom bestowed upon
 them from any view to those effects. Times of violent religious
controversy have generally been times of equally violent political
faction. Upon such occasions, each political party has either found it,
or imagined it, for its interest, to league itself with some one or
other of the contending religious sects. But this could be done only by
adopting, or at least by favouring, the tenets of that particular sect.
The sect which had the good fortune to be leagued with the conquering <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>277<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 party, necessarily shared in the victory of its ally, by whose favour
and protection it was soon enabled in some degree to silence and subdue
all its adversaries. Those adversaries had generally leagued themselves
with the enemies of the conquering party, and were therefore the enemies
 of that party. The clergy of this particular sect having thus become
complete masters of the field, and their influence and authority with
the great body of the people being in its highest vigour, they were
powerful enough to over-awe the chiefs and leaders of their own party,
and to oblige the civil magistrate to respect their opinions and
inclinations. Their first demand was generally, that he should silence
and subdue all their adversaries; and their second, that he should
bestow an independent provision on themselves. As they had generally
contributed a good deal to the victory, it seemed not unreasonable that
they should have some share in the spoil. They were weary, besides, of
humouring the people, and of depending upon their caprice for a
subsistence. In making this demand therefore they consulted their own
ease and comfort, without troubling themselves about the effect which it
 might have in future times upon the influence and authority of their
order. The civil magistrate, who could comply with this demand only by
giving them something which he would have chosen much rather to take, or
 to keep to himself, was seldom very forward to grant it. Necessity,
however, always forced him to submit at last, though frequently not till
 after many delays, evasions, and affected excuses.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_682">But if politics had never called in the aid of religion, had the conquering<span class="type-margin"><span>If
 politics had never called in the aid of religion, sects would have been
 so numerous that they would have learnt to tolerate each other,</span></span>
 party never adopted the tenets of one sect more than those of another,
when it had gained the victory, it would probably have dealt equally and
 impartially with all the different sects, and have allowed every man to
 chuse his own priest and his own religion as he thought proper. There
would in this case, no doubt, have been a great multitude of religious
sects. Almost every different congregation might probably have made a
little sect by itself, or have entertained some peculiar tenets of its
own. Each teacher would no doubt have felt himself under the necessity
of making the utmost exertion, and of using every art both to preserve
and to increase the number of his disciples. But as every other teacher
would have felt himself under the same necessity, the success of no one
teacher, or sect of teachers, could have been very great. The interested
 and active zeal of religious teachers can be dangerous and troublesome
only where there is, either but one sect tolerated in the society, or
where the whole of a large society is divided into two or three great
sects; the teachers of each<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt489" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt489_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> acting by concert, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>278<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 and under a regular discipline and subordination. But that zeal must be
 altogether innocent where the society is divided into two or three
hundred, or perhaps into as many thousand small sects, of which no one
could be considerable enough to disturb the public tranquillity. The
teachers of each sect, seeing themselves surrounded on all sides with
more adversaries than friends, would be obliged to learn that candour
and moderation which is so seldom to be found among the teachers of
those great sects, whose tenets, being supported by the civil
magistrate, are held in veneration by almost all the inhabitants of
extensive kingdoms and empires, and who therefore see nothing round them
 but followers, disciples, and humble admirers. The teachers of each
little sect, finding themselves almost alone, would be obliged to
respect those of almost every other sect, and the concessions which they
 would mutually find it both convenient and agreeable to make to one
another, might in time probably reduce the doctrine of the greater part
of them to that pure and rational religion, free from every mixture of
absurdity, imposture, or fanaticism, such as wise men have in all ages
of the world wished to see established; but such as positive law has
perhaps never yet established, and probably never will establish in any
country: because, with regard to religion, positive law always has been,
 and probably always will be, more or less influenced by popular
superstition and enthusiasm. This plan of ecclesiastical government, or
more properly of no ecclesiastical government, was what the sect called
Independents, a sect no doubt of very wild enthusiasts, proposed to
establish in England towards the end of the civil war. If it had been
established, though of a very unphilosophical origin, it would probably
by this time have been productive of the most philosophical good temper
and moderation with regard to every sort of religious principle. It has
been established in Pensylvania, where, though the Quakers happen to be
the most numerous,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt490" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt490_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 the law in reality favours no one sect more than another, and it is
there said to have been productive of this philosophical good temper and
 moderation.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_683"><span class="type-margin"><span>and if they did not, their zeal could do no harm</span></span>But
 though this equality of treatment should not be productive of this good
 temper and moderation in all, or even in the greater part of the
religious sects of a particular country; yet provided those sects were
sufficiently numerous, and each of them consequently too small to
disturb the public tranquillity, the excessive zeal of each<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt491" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt491_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 for its particular tenets could not well be productive of any very
hurtful effects, but, on the contrary, of several good ones: and if the
government was perfectly decided both to let them all alone, and to
oblige them all to <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>279<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 let alone one another, there is little danger that they would not of
their own accord subdivide themselves fast enough, so as soon to become
sufficiently numerous.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_684">In every civilized society, in every society where the distinction of<span class="type-margin"><span>Of
 the two systems of morality, the strict or austere and the liberal or
loose, the first is favoured by the common people, the second by people
of fashion</span></span> ranks has once been completely established,
there have been always two different schemes or systems of morality
current at the same time; of which the one may be called the strict or
austere; the other the liberal, or, if you will, the loose system. The
former is generally admired and revered by the common people: the latter
 is commonly more esteemed and adopted by what are called people of
fashion. The degree of disapprobation with which we ought to mark the
vices of levity, the vices which are apt to arise from great prosperity,
 and from the excess of gaiety and good humour, seems to constitute the
principal distinction between those two opposite schemes or systems. In
the liberal or loose system, luxury, wanton and even disorderly mirth,
the pursuit of pleasure to some degree of intemperance, the breach of
chastity, at least in one of the two sexes, &amp;c. provided they are
not accompanied with gross indecency, and do not lead to falshood or
injustice, are generally treated with a good deal of indulgence, and are
 easily either excused or pardoned altogether. In the austere system, on
 the contrary, those excesses are regarded with the utmost abhorrence
and detestation. The vices of levity are always ruinous to the common
people, and a single week’s thoughtlessness and dissipation is often
sufficient to undo a poor workman for ever, and to drive him through
despair upon committing the most enormous crimes. The wiser and better
sort of the common people, therefore, have always the utmost abhorrence
and detestation of such excesses, which their experience tells them are
so immediately fatal to people of their condition. The disorder and
extravagance of several years, on the contrary, will not always ruin a
man of fashion, and people of that rank are very apt to consider the
power of indulging in some degree of excess as one of the advantages of
their fortune, and the liberty of doing so without censure or reproach,
as one of the privileges which belong to their station. In people of
their own station, therefore, they regard such excesses with but a small
 degree of disapprobation, and censure them either very slightly or not
at all.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_685">Almost all religious sects have begun among the common people,<span class="type-margin"><span>Religious sects usually begin with the austere system,</span></span>
 from whom they have generally drawn their earliest, as well as their
most numerous proselytes. The austere system of morality has,
accordingly, been adopted by those sects almost constantly, or with very
 few exceptions; for there have been some. It was the system by which
they could best recommend themselves to that order of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>280<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 people to whom they first proposed their plan of reformation upon what
had been before established. Many of them, perhaps the greater part of
them, have even endeavoured to gain credit by refining upon this austere
 system, and by carrying it to some degree of folly and extravagance;
and this excessive rigour has frequently recommended them more than any
thing else to the respect and veneration of the common people.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_686"><span class="type-margin"><span>and in small religious sects morals are regular and orderly and even disagreeably rigorous and unsocial</span></span>A
 man of rank and fortune is by his station the distinguished member of a
 great society, who attend to every part of his conduct, and who thereby
 oblige him to attend to every part of it himself. His authority and
consideration depend very much upon the respect which this society bears
 to him. He dare not do any thing which would disgrace or discredit him
in it, and he is obliged to a very strict observation of that species of
 morals, whether liberal or austere, which the general consent of this
society prescribes to persons of his rank and fortune. A man of low
condition, on the contrary, is far from being a distinguished member of
any great society. While he remains in a country village his conduct may
 be attended to, and he may be obliged to attend to it himself. In this
situation, and in this situation only, he may have what is called a
character to lose. But as soon as he comes into a great city, he is sunk
 in obscurity and darkness. His conduct is observed and attended to by
nobody, and he is therefore very likely to neglect it himself, and to
abandon himself to every sort of low profligacy and vice. He never
emerges so effectually from this obscurity, his conduct never excites so
 much the attention of any respectable society, as by his becoming the
member of a small religious sect. He from that moment acquires a degree
of consideration which he never had before. All his brother sectaries
are, for the credit of the sect, interested to observe his conduct, and
if he gives occasion to any scandal, if he deviates very much from those
 austere morals which they almost always require of one another, to
punish him by what is always a very severe punishment, even where no
civil effects attend it, expulsion or excommunication from the sect. In
little religious sects, accordingly, the morals of the common people
have been almost always remarkably regular and orderly; generally much
more so than in the established church. The morals of those little
sects, indeed, have frequently been rather disagreeably rigorous and
unsocial.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_687"><span class="type-margin"><span>There are two possible remedies.</span></span>There
 are two very easy and effectual remedies, however, by whose joint
operation the state might, without violence, correct whatever was
unsocial or disagreeably rigorous in the morals of all the little sects
into which the country was divided.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>281<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_688">The first of those remedies is the study of science and philosophy,<span class="type-margin"><span>(1) the requirement of a knowledge of science and philosophy from candidates for professions and offices</span></span>
 which the state might render almost universal among all people of
middling or more than middling rank and fortune; not by giving salaries
to teachers in order to make them negligent and idle, but by instituting
 some sort of probation, even in the higher and more difficult sciences,
 to be undergone by every person before he was permitted to exercise any
 liberal profession, or before he could be received as a candidate for
any honourable office of trust or profit. If the state imposed upon this
 order of men the necessity of learning, it would have no occasion to
give itself any trouble about providing them with proper teachers. They
would soon find better teachers for themselves than any whom the state
could provide for them. Science is the great antidote to the poison of
enthusiasm and superstition; and where all the superior ranks of people
were secured from it, the inferior ranks could not be much exposed to
it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_689">The second of those remedies is the frequency and gaiety of public<span class="type-margin"><span>and (2) the encouragement of public diversions.</span></span>
 diversions. The state, by encouraging, that is by giving entire liberty
 to all those who for their own interest would attempt, without scandal
or indecency, to amuse and divert the people by painting, poetry, music,
 dancing; by all sorts of dramatic representations and exhibitions,
would easily dissipate, in the greater part of them, that melancholy and
 gloomy humour which is almost always the nurse of popular superstition
and enthusiasm. Public diversions have always been the objects of dread
and hatred, to all the fanatical promoters of those popular frenzies.
The gaiety and good humour which those diversions inspire were
altogether inconsistent with that temper of mind, which was fittest for
their purpose, or which they could best work upon. Dramatic
representations besides, frequently exposing their artifices to public
ridicule, and sometimes even to public execration, were upon that
account, more than all other diversions, the objects of their peculiar
abhorrence.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_690">In a country where the law favoured the teachers of no one religion<span class="type-margin"><span>Where no one religion was favoured the sovereign would not require to influence the teachers of religion,</span></span>
 more than those of another, it would not be necessary that any of them
should have any particular or immediate dependency upon the sovereign or
 executive power; or that he should have any thing to do, either in
appointing, or in dismissing them from their offices. In such a
situation he would have no occasion to give himself any concern about
them, further than to keep the peace among them, in the same manner as
among the rest of his subjects; that is, to hinder them from
persecuting, abusing, or oppressing one another. But it is quite
otherwise in countries where there is an established or governing <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>282<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 religion. The sovereign can in this case never be secure, unless he has
 the means of influencing in a considerable degree the greater part of
the teachers of that religion.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_691"><span class="type-margin"><span>as he must where there is an established church,</span></span>The
 clergy of every established church constitute a great incorporation.
They can act in concert, and pursue their interest upon one plan and
with one spirit, as much as if they were under the direction of one man;
 and they are frequently too under such direction. Their interest as an
incorporated body is never the same with that of the sovereign, and is
sometimes directly opposite to it. Their great interest is to maintain
their authority with the people; and this authority depends upon the
supposed certainty and importance of the whole doctrine which they
inculcate, and upon the supposed necessity of adopting every part of it
with the most implicit faith, in order to avoid eternal misery. Should
the sovereign have the imprudence to appear either to deride or doubt
himself of the most trifling part of their doctrine, or from humanity
attempt to protect those who did either the one or the other, the
punctilious honour of a clergy who have no sort of dependency upon him,
is immediately provoked to proscribe him as a profane person, and to
employ all the terrors of religion in order to oblige the people to
transfer their allegiance to some more orthodox and obedient prince.
Should he oppose any of their pretensions or usurpations, the danger is
equally great. The princes who have dared in this manner to rebel
against the church, over and above this crime of rebellion, have
generally been charged too with the additional crime of heresy,
notwithstanding their solemn protestations of their faith and humble
submission to every tenet which she thought proper to prescribe to them.
 But the authority of religion is superior to every other authority. The
 fears which it suggests conquer all other fears. When the authorised
teachers of religion propagate through the great body of the people
doctrines subversive of the authority of the sovereign, it is by
violence only, or by the force of a standing army, that he can maintain
his authority. Even a standing army cannot in this case give him any
lasting security; because if the soldiers are not foreigners, which can
seldom be the case, but drawn from the great body of the people, which
must almost always be the case, they are likely to be soon corrupted by
those very doctrines. The revolutions which the turbulence of the Greek
clergy was continually occasioning at Constantinople, as long as the
eastern empire subsisted; the convulsions which, during the course of
several centuries, the turbulence of the Roman clergy was continually
occasioning in every part of Europe, sufficiently demonstrate how
precarious <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>283<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 and insecure must always be the situation of the sovereign who has no
proper means of influencing the clergy of the established and governing
religion of his country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_692">Articles of faith, as well as all other spiritual matters, it is evident<span class="type-margin"><span>since he cannot directly oppose the doctrines of the clergy.</span></span>
 enough, are not within the proper department of a temporal sovereign,
who, though he may be very well qualified for protecting, is seldom
supposed to be so for instructing the people. With regard to such
matters, therefore, his authority can seldom be sufficient to
counterbalance the united authority of the clergy of the established
church. The public tranquillity, however, and his own security, may
frequently depend upon the doctrines which they may think proper to
propagate concerning such matters. As he can seldom directly oppose
their decision, therefore, with proper weight and authority, it is
necessary that he should be able to influence it; and he can influence
it only by the fears and expectations which he may excite in the greater
 part of the individuals of the order. Those fears and expectations may
consist in the fear of deprivation or other punishment, and in the
expectation of further preferment.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_693">In all Christian churches the benefices of the clergy are a sort of<span class="type-margin"><span>The clergy hold their benefices for life, and violence used against them would be ineffectual: so management must be resorted to</span></span>
 freeholds which they enjoy, not during pleasure, but during life, or
good behaviour. If they held them by a more precarious tenure, and were
liable to be turned out upon every slight disobligation either of the
sovereign or of his ministers, it would perhaps be impossible for them
to maintain their authority with the people, who would then consider
them as mercenary dependents upon the court, in the sincerity of whose
instructions they could no longer have any confidence. But should the
sovereign attempt irregularly, and by violence, to deprive any number of
 clergymen of their freeholds, on account, perhaps, of their having
propagated, with more than ordinary zeal, some factious or seditious
doctrine, he would only render, by such persecution, both them and their
 doctrine ten times more popular, and therefore ten times more
troublesome and dangerous than they had been before. Fear is in almost
all cases a wretched instrument of government, and ought in particular
never to be employed against any order of men who have the smallest
pretensions to independency. To attempt to terrify them, serves only to
irritate their bad humour, and to confirm them in an opposition which
more gentle usage perhaps might easily induce them, either to soften, or
 to lay aside altogether. The violence which the French government
usually employed in order to oblige all their parliaments, or sovereign
courts of justice, to enregister any unpopular edict, very seldom
succeeded. <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>284<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 The means commonly employed, however, the imprisonment of all the
refractory members, one would think were forcible enough. The princes of
 the house of Stewart sometimes employed the like means in order to
influence some of the members of the parliament of England; and they
generally found them equally intractable. The parliament of England is
now managed in another manner; and a very small experiment, which the
duke of Choiseul made about twelve years ago upon the parliament of
Paris, demonstrated sufficiently that all the parliaments of France
might have been managed still more easily in the same manner. That
experiment was not pursued. For though management and persuasion are
always the easiest and the safest instruments of government, as force
and violence are the worst and the most dangerous, yet such, it seems,
is the natural insolence of man, that he almost always disdains to use
the good instrument, except when he cannot or dare not use the bad one.
The French government could and durst use force, and therefore disdained
 to use management and persuasion. But there is no order of men, it
appears, I believe, from the experience of all ages, upon whom it is so
dangerous, or rather so perfectly ruinous, to employ force and violene,
as upon the respected clergy of any established church. The rights, the
privileges, the personal liberty of every individual ecclesiastic, who
is upon good terms with his own order, are, even in the most despotic
governments, more respected than those of any other person of nearly
equal rank and fortune. It is so in every gradation of despotism, from
that of the gentle and mild government of Paris, to that of the violent
and furious government of Constantinople. But though this order of men
can scarce ever be forced, they may be managed as easily as any other;
and the security of the sovereign, as well as the public tranquillity,
seems to depend very much upon the means which he has of managing them;
and those means seem to consist altogether in the preferment which he
has to bestow upon them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_694"><span class="type-margin"><span>Bishops were originally elected by the clergy and people, afterwards by the clergy alone,</span></span>In the ancient constitution of the Christian church,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt492" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt492_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 the bishop of each diocese was elected by the joint votes of the clergy
 and of the people of the episcopal city. The people did not long retain
 their right of election; and while they did retain it, they almost
always acted under the influence of the clergy, who in such spiritual
matters appeared to be their natural guides. The clergy, however, soon
grew weary of the trouble of managing them, and found it easier to elect
 their own bishops themselves. The abbot, in the same manner, was
elected by the monks of the monastery, at least in the greater part of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>285<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 abbacies. All the inferior ecclesiastical benefices comprehended within
 the diocese were collated by the bishop, who bestowed them upon such
ecclesiastics as he thought proper. All church preferments were in this
manner in the disposal of the church. The sovereign, though he might
have some indirect influence in those elections, and though it was
sometimes usual to ask both his consent to elect, and his approbation of
 the election, yet had no direct or sufficient means of managing the
clergy. The ambition of every clergyman naturally led him to pay court,
not so much to his sovereign, as to his own order, from which only he
could expect preferment.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_695">Through the greater part of Europe the Pope gradually drew<span class="type-margin"><span>still later to a large extent by the Pope</span></span>
 to himself first the collation of almost all bishoprics and abbacies,
or of what were called Consistorial benefices, and afterwards, by
various machinations and pretences, of the greater part of inferior
benefices comprehended within each diocese; little more being left to
the bishop than what was barely necessary to give him a decent authority
 with his own clergy. By this arrangement the condition of the sovereign
 was still worse than it had been before. The clergy of all the
different countries of Europe were thus formed into a sort of spiritual
army, dispersed in different quarters, indeed, but of which all the
movements and operations could now be directed by one head, and
conducted upon one uniform plan. The clergy of each particular country
might be considered as a particular detachment of that army, of which
the operations could easily be supported and seconded by all the other
detachments quartered in the different countries round about. Each
detachment was not only independent of the sovereign of the country in
which it was quartered, and by which it was maintained, but dependent
upon a foreign sovereign, who could at any time turn its arms against
the sovereign of that particular country, and support them by the arms
of all the other detachments.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_696">Those arms were the most formidable that can well be imagined.<span class="type-margin"><span>This, joined with the great wealth of the clergy, rendered them exceedingly formidable.</span></span>
 In the ancient state of Europe, before the establishment of arts and
manufactures, the wealth of the clergy gave them the same sort of
influence over the common people, which that of the great barons gave
them over their respective vassals, tenants, and retainers. In the great
 landed estates, which the mistaken piety both of princes and private
persons had bestowed upon the church, jurisdictions were established of
the same kind with those of the great barons; and for the same reason.
In those great landed estates, the clergy, or their bailiffs, could
easily keep the peace without the support or assistance either of the
king or of any other person; and neither the king nor any <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>286<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 other person could keep the peace there without the support and
assistance of the clergy. The jurisdictions of the clergy, therefore, in
 their particular baronies or manors, were equally independent, and
equally exclusive of the authority of the king’s courts, as those of the
 great temporal lords. The tenants of the clergy were, like those of the
 great barons, almost all tenants at will, entirely dependent upon their
 immediate lords, and therefore liable to be called out at pleasure, in
order to fight in any quarrel in which the clergy might think proper to
engage them. Over and above the rents of those estates, the clergy
possessed, in the tythes, a very large portion of the rents of all the
other estates in every kingdom of Europe. The revenues arising from both
 those species of rents were, the greater part of them, paid in kind, in
 corn, wine, cattle, poultry, &amp;c. The quantity exceeded greatly what
 the clergy could themselves consume; and there were neither arts nor
manufactures for the produce of which they could exchange the surplus.
The clergy could derive advantage from this immense surplus in no other
way than by employing it, as the great barons employed the like surplus
of their revenues, in the most profuse hospitality, and in the most
extensive charity. Both the hospitality and the charity of the ancient
clergy, accordingly, are said to have been very great. They not only
maintained almost the whole poor of every kingdom, but many knights and
gentlemen had frequently no other means of subsistence than by
travelling about from monastery to monastery, under pretence of
devotion, but in reality to enjoy the hospitality of the clergy. The
retainers of some particular prelates were often as numerous as those of
 the greatest lay-lords; and the retainers of all the clergy taken
together were, perhaps, more numerous than those of all the lay-lords.
There was always much more union among the clergy than among the
lay-lords. The former were under a regular discipline and subordination
to the papal authority. The latter were under no regular discipline or
subordination, but almost always equally jealous of one another, and of
the king. Though the tenants and retainers of the clergy, therefore, had
 both together been less numerous than those of the great lay-lords, and
 their tenants were probably much less numerous, yet their union would
have rendered them more formidable. The hospitality and charity of the
clergy too, not only gave them the command of a great temporal force,
but increased very much the weight of their spiritual weapons. Those
virtues procured them the highest respect and veneration among all the
inferior ranks of people, of whom many were constantly, and almost all
occasionally, fed by them. Every thing belonging or related to so
popular an order, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>287<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 its possessions, its privileges, its doctrines, necessarily appeared
sacred in the eyes of the common people, and every violation of them,
whether real or pretended, the highest act of sacrilegious wickedness
and profaneness. In this state of things, if the sovereign frequently
found it difficult to resist the confederacy of a few of the great
nobility, we cannot wonder that he should find it still more so to
resist the united force of the clergy of his own dominions, supported by
 that of the clergy of all the neighbouring dominions. In such
circumstances the wonder is, not that he was sometimes obliged to yield,
 but that he ever was able to resist.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_697">The privileges of the clergy in those ancient times (which to us<span class="type-margin"><span>Benefit of clergy and other privileges were the natural result</span></span>
 who live in the present times appear the most absurd), their total
exemption from the secular jurisdiction, for example, or what in England
 was called the benefit of clergy; were the natural or rather the
necessary consequences of this state of things. How dangerous must it
have been for the sovereign to attempt to punish a clergyman for any
crime whatever, if his own order were disposed to protect him, and to
represent either the proof as insufficient for convicting so holy a man,
 or the punishment as too severe to be inflicted upon one whose person
had been rendered sacred by religion? The sovereign could, in such
circumstances, do no better than leave him to be tried by the
ecclesiastical courts, who, for the honour of their own order, were
interested to restrain, as much as possible, every member of it from
committing enormous crimes, or even from giving occasion to such gross
scandal as might disgust the minds of the people.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_698">In the state in which things were through the greater part of<span class="type-margin"><span>The Church of Rome in the Middle Ages was the most formidable combination against liberty reason and happiness</span></span>
 Europe during the tenth, eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries,
and for some time both before and after that period, the constitution of
 the church of Rome may be considered as the most formidable combination
 that ever was formed against the authority and security of civil
government, as well as against the liberty, reason, and happiness of
mankind, which can flourish only where civil government is able to
protect them. In that constitution the grossest delusions of
superstition were supported in such a manner by the private interests of
 so great a number of people as put them out of all danger from any
assault of human reason: because though human reason might perhaps have
been able to unveil, even to the eyes of the common people, some of the
delusions of superstition; it could never have dissolved the ties of
private interest. Had this constitution been attacked by no other
enemies but the feeble efforts of human reason, it must have endured for
 ever. But that immense and well-built fabric, which all <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>288<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 the wisdom and virtue of man could never have shaken, much less have
overturned, was by the natural course of things, first weakened, and<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt493" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt493_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 afterwards in part destroyed, and is now likely, in the course of a few
 centuries more, perhaps, to crumble into ruins altogether.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_699"><span class="type-margin"><span>Its power was destroyed by the improvement of arts, manufactures and commerce.</span></span>The
 gradual improvements of arts, manufactures, and commerce, the same
causes which destroyed the power of the great barons, destroyed in the
same manner, through the greater part of Europe, the whole temporal
power of the clergy. In the produce of arts, manufactures, and commerce,
 the clergy, like the great barons, found something for which they could
 exchange their rude produce, and thereby discovered the means of
spending their whole revenues upon their own persons, without giving any
 considerable share of them to other people. Their charity became
gradually less extensive, their hospitality less liberal or less
profuse. Their retainers became consequently less numerous, and by
degrees dwindled away altogether. The clergy too, like the great barons,
 wished to get a better rent from their landed estates, in order to
spend it, in the same manner, upon the gratification of their own
private vanity and folly. But this increase of rent could be got only by
 granting leases to their tenants, who thereby became in a great measure
 independent of them. The ties of interest, which bound the inferior
ranks of people to the clergy, were in this manner gradually broken and
dissolved. They were even broken and dissolved sooner than those which
bound the same ranks of people to the great barons: because the
benefices of the church being, the greater part of them, much smaller
than the estates of the great barons, the possessor of each benefice was
 much sooner able to spend the whole of its revenue upon his own person.
 During the greater part of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the
power of the great barons was, through the greater part of Europe, in
full vigour. But the temporal power of the clergy, the absolute command
which they had once had over the great body of the people, was very much
 decayed. The power of the church was by that time very nearly reduced
through the greater part of Europe to what arose from her spiritual
authority; and even that spiritual authority was much weakened when it
ceased to be supported by the charity and hospitality of the clergy. The
 inferior ranks of people no longer looked upon that order, as they had
done before, as the comforters of their distress, and the relievers of
their indigence. On the contrary, they were provoked and disgusted by
the vanity, luxury, and expence of the richer clergy, who appeared to
spend upon their own pleasures what had always before been regarded as
the patrimony of the poor.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>289<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_700">In this situation of things, the sovereigns in the different states of<span class="type-margin"><span>The
 sovereigns endeavoured to deprive the Pope of the disposal of the great
 benefices, and succeeded, especially in France and England.</span></span>
 Europe endeavoured to recover the influence which they had once had in
the disposal of the great benefices of the church, by procuring to the
deans and chapters of each diocese the restoration of their ancient
right of electing the bishop, and to the monks of each abbacy that of
electing the abbot. The re-establishing of this ancient order was the
object of several statutes enacted in England during the course of the
fourteenth century, particularly of what is called the statute of
provisors;<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt494" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt494_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 and of the Pragmatic sanction established in France in the fifteenth
century. In order to render the election valid, it was necessary that
the sovereign should both consent to it before-hand, and afterwards
approve of the person elected; and though the election was still
supposed to be free, he had, however, all the indirect means which his
situation necessarily afforded him, of influencing the clergy in his own
 dominions. Other regulations of a similar tendency were established in
other parts of Europe. But the power of the pope in the collation of the
 great benefices of the church seems, before the reformation, to have
been nowhere so effectually and so universally restrained as in France
and England. The Concordat afterwards, in the sixteenth century, gave to
 the kings of France the absolute right of presenting to all the great,
or what are called the consistorial<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt495" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt495_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> benefices of the Gallican church.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt496" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt496_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_701">Since the establishment of the Pragmatic sanction and of the Concordat,<span class="type-margin"><span>Ever since the French clergy have been less devoted to the Pope</span></span>
 the clergy of France have in general shown less respect to the decrees
of the papal court than the clergy of any other catholic country. In all
 the disputes which their sovereign has had with the pope, they have
almost constantly taken party with the former. This independency of the
clergy of France upon the court of Rome, seems to be principally founded
 upon the Pragmatic sanction and the Concordat. In the earlier periods
of the monarchy, the clergy of France appear to have been as much
devoted to the pope as those of any other country. When Robert, the
second prince of the Capetian race, was most unjustly excommunicated by
the court of Rome, his own servants, it is said, threw the victuals
which came from his table to the dogs, and refused to taste any thing
themselves which had been polluted by the contact of a person in his
situation.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt497" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt497_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> They were taught to <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>290<span class="bracket">]</span></span> do so, it may very safely be presumed, by the clergy of his own dominions.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_702"><span class="type-margin"><span>So even before the Reformation the clergy had less power and inclination to disturb the state.</span></span>The
 claim of collating to the great benefices of the church, a claim in
defence of which the court of Rome had frequently shaken, and sometimes
overturned the thrones of some of the greatest sovereigns in
Christendom, was in this manner either restrained or modified, or given
up altogether, in many different parts of Europe, even before the time
of the reformation. As the clergy had now less influence over the
people, so the state had more influence over the clergy. The clergy
therefore had both less power and less inclination to disturb the state.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_703"><span class="type-margin"><span>The Reformation doctrines were recommended to the common people by the zeal of their teachers,</span></span>The
 authority of the church of Rome was in this state of declension, when
the disputes which gave birth to the reformation, began in Germany, and
soon spread themselves through every part of Europe. The new doctrines
were every where received with a high degree of popular favour. They
were propagated with all that enthusiastic zeal which commonly animates
the spirit of party, when it attacks established authority. The teachers
 of those doctrines, though perhaps in other respects not more learned
than many of the divines who defended the established church, seem in
general to have been better acquainted with ecclesiastical history, and
with the origin and progress of that system of opinions upon which the
authority of the church was established, and they had thereby some
advantage in almost every dispute. The austerity of their manners gave
them authority with the common people, who contrasted the strict
regularity of their conduct with the disorderly lives of the greater
part of their own clergy. They possessed too in a much higher degree
than their adversaries, all the arts of popularity and of gaining
proselytes, arts which the lofty and dignified sons of the church had
long neglected, as being to them in a great measure useless. The reason
of the new doctrines recommended them to some, their novelty to many;
the hatred and contempt of the established clergy to a still greater
number; but the zealous, passionate, and fanatical, though frequently
coarse and rustic, eloquence with which they were almost every where
inculcated, recommended them to by far the greatest number.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_704"><span class="type-margin"><span>and enabled sovereigns on bad terms with Rome to overturn the Church with ease,</span></span>The
 success of the new doctrines was almost every where so great, that the
princes who at that time happened to be on bad terms with the court of
Rome, were by means of them easily enabled, in their own dominions, to
overturn the church, which, having lost the respect and veneration of
the inferior ranks of people, could make scarce any resistance. The
court of Rome had disobliged some of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>291<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 the smaller princes in the northern parts of Germany, whom it had
probably considered as too insignificant to be worth the managing. They
universally, therefore, established the reformation in their own
dominions. The tyranny of Christiern II. and of Troll archbishop of
Upsal, enabled Gustavus Vasa to expel them both from Sweden. The pope
favoured the tyrant and the archbishop, and Gustavus Vasa found no
difficulty in establishing the reformation in Sweden. Christiern II. was
 afterwards deposed from the throne of Denmark, where his conduct had
rendered him as odious as in Sweden. The pope, however, was still
disposed to favour him, and Frederic of Holstein, who had mounted the
throne in his stead, revenged himself by following the example of
Gustavus Vasa. The magistrates of Berne and Zurich, who had no
particular quarrel with the pope, established with great ease the
reformation in their respective cantons, where just before some of the
clergy had, by an imposture somewhat grosser than ordinary, rendered the
 whole order both odious and contemptible.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_705">In this critical situation of its affairs, the papal court was at sufficient<span class="type-margin"><span>while in countries the sovereigns of which were friendly to Rome the Reformation was suppressed or obstructed</span></span>
 pains to cultivate the friendship of the powerful sovereigns of France
and Spain, of whom the latter was at that time emperor of Germany. With
their assistance it was enabled, though not without great difficulty and
 much bloodshed, either to suppress altogether, or to obstruct very much
 the progress of the reformation in their dominions. It was well enough
inclined too to be complaisant to the king of England. But from the
circumstances of the times, it could not be so without giving offence to
 a still greater sovereign, Charles V. king of Spain and emperor of
Germany. Henry VIII. accordingly, though he did not embrace himself the
greater part of the doctrines of the reformation, was yet enabled, by
their general prevalence,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt498" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt498_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 to suppress all the monasteries, and to abolish the authority of the
church of Rome in his dominions. That he should go so far, though he
went no further, gave some satisfaction to the patrons of the
reformation, who having got possession of the government in the reign of
 his son and successor, completed without any difficulty the work which
Henry VIII. had begun.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_706">In some countries, as in Scotland, where the government was weak,<span class="type-margin"><span>In some countries the Reformation overturned both church and state.</span></span>
 unpopular, and not very firmly established, the reformation was strong
enough to overturn, not only the church, but the state likewise for
attempting to support the church.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_707">Among the followers of the reformation, dispersed in all the different<span class="type-margin"><span>The followers of the Reformation had no common authority like the court of Rome, and divided into Lutherans and Calvinists.</span></span> countries of Europe, there was no general tribunal, which, like that of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>292<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 the court of Rome, or an œcumenical council, could settle all disputes
among them, and with irresistible authority prescribe to all of them the
 precise limits of orthodoxy. When the followers of the reformation in
one country, therefore, happened to differ from their brethren in
another, as they had no common judge to appeal to, the dispute could
never be decided; and many such disputes arose among them. Those
concerning the government of the church, and the right of conferring
ecclesiastical benefices, were perhaps the most interesting to the peace
 and welfare of civil society. They gave birth accordingly to the two
principal parties or sects among the followers of the reformation, the
Lutheran and Calvinistic sects, the only sects among them, of which the
doctrine and discipline have ever yet been established by law in any
part of Europe.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_708"><span class="type-margin"><span>The Lutherans
and the Church of England preferred episcopacy, and gave the disposal of
 benefices to the sovereign and other lay patrons.</span></span>The
followers of Luther, together with what is called the church of England,
 preserved more or less of the episcopal government, established
subordination among the clergy, gave the sovereign the disposal of all
the bishoprics, and other consistorial benefices within his dominions,
and thereby rendered him the real head of the church; and without
depriving the bishop of the right of collating to the smaller benefices
within his diocese, they, even to those benefices, not only admitted,
but favoured the right of presentation both in the sovereign and in all
other lay patrons. This system of church government was from the
beginning favourable to peace and good order, and to submission to the
civil sovereign. It has never, accordingly, been the occasion of any
tumult or civil commotion in any country in which it has once been
established. The church of England in particular has always valued
herself, with great reason, upon the unexceptionable loyalty of her
principles. Under such a government the clergy naturally endeavour to
recommend themselves to the sovereign, to the court, and to the nobility
 and gentry of the country, by whose influence they chiefly expect to
obtain preferment. They pay court to those patrons, sometimes, no doubt,
 by the vilest flattery and assentation, but frequently too by
cultivating all those arts which best deserve, and which are therefore
most likely to gain them the esteem of people of rank and fortune; by
their knowledge in all the different branches of useful and ornamental
learning, by the decent liberality of their manners, by the social good
humour of their conversation, and by their avowed contempt of those
absurd and hypocritical austerities which fanatics inculcate and pretend
 to practise, in order to draw upon themselves the veneration, and upon
the greater part of men of rank and fortune, who avow that they do not
practise them, the abhorrence of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>293<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 the common people. Such a clergy, however, while they pay their court
in this manner to the higher ranks of life, are very apt to neglect
altogether the means of maintaining their influence and authority with
the lower. They are listened to, esteemed and respected by their
superiors; but before their inferiors they are frequently incapable of
defending, effectually and to the conviction of such hearers, their own
sober and moderate doctrines against the most ignorant enthusiast who
chuses to attack them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_709">The followers of Zuinglius, or more properly those of Calvin, on the<span class="type-margin"><span>Zwinglians and Calvinists gave the right of election to the people, and established equality among the clergy,</span></span>
 contrary, bestowed upon the people of each parish, whenever the church
became vacant, the right of electing their own pastor; and established
at the same time the most perfect equality among the clergy. The former
part of this institution, as long as it remained in vigour, seems to
have been productive of nothing but disorder and confusion, and to have
tended equally to corrupt the morals both of the clergy and of the
people. The latter part seems never to have had any effects but what
were perfectly agreeable.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_710">As long as the people of each parish preserved the right of electing<span class="type-margin"><span>Election by the people gave rise to great disorders.</span></span>
 their own pastors, they acted almost always under the influence of the
clergy, and generally of the most factious and fanatical of the order.
The clergy, in order to preserve their influence in those popular
elections, became, or affected to become, many of them, fanatics
themselves, encouraged fanaticism among the people, and gave the
preference almost always to the most fanatical candidate. So small a
matter as the appointment of a parish priest occasioned almost always a
violent contest, not only in one parish, but in all the neighbouring
parishes, who seldom failed to take part<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt499" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt499_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 in the quarrel. When the parish happened to be situated in a great
city, it divided all the inhabitants into two parties; and when that
city happened either to constitute itself a little republic, or to be
the head and capital of a little republic, as is the case with many of
the considerable cities in Switzerland and Holland, every paltry dispute
 of this kind, over and above exasperating the animosity of all their
other factions, threatened to leave behind it both a new schism in the
church, and a new faction in the state. In those small republics,
therefore, the magistrate very soon found it necessary, for the sake of
preserving the public peace, to assume to himself the right of
presenting to all vacant benefices. In Scotland,<span class="type-margin"><span>and after trial was abolished in Scotland, though the concurrence of the people is still required</span></span>
 the most extensive country in which this presbyterian form of church
government has ever been established, the rights of patronage were in
effect abolished by the act which established presbytery in the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>294<span class="bracket">]</span></span> beginning of the reign of William III.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt500" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt500_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 That act at least put it in the power of certain classes of people in
each parish, to purchase, for a very small price, the right of electing
their own pastor. The constitution which this act established was
allowed to subsist for about two and twenty years, but was abolished by
the 10th of queen Anne, ch. 12. on account of the confusions and
disorders which this more popular mode of election had almost every
where occasioned.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt501" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt501_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 In so extensive a country as Scotland, however, a tumult in a remote
parish was not so likely to give disturbance to government, as in a
smaller state. The 10th of queen Anne restored the rights of patronage.
But though in Scotland the law gives the benefice without any exception
to the person presented by the patron; yet the church requires sometimes
 (for she has not in this respect been very uniform in her decisions) a
certain concurrence of the people, before she will confer upon the
presentee what is called the cure of souls, or the ecclesiastical
jurisdiction in the parish. She sometimes at least, from an affected
concern for the peace of the parish, delays the settlement till this
concurrence can be procured. The private tampering of some of the
neighbouring clergy, sometimes to procure, but more frequently to
prevent this concurrence, and the popular arts which they cultivate in
order to enable them upon such occasions to tamper more effectually, are
 perhaps the causes which principally keep up whatever remains of the
old fanatical spirit, either in the clergy or in the people of Scotland.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_711"><span class="type-margin"><span>The equality of the Presbyterian clergy makes them independent and respectable</span></span>The
 equality which the presbyterian form of church government establishes
among the clergy, consists, first, in the equality of authority or
ecclesiastical jurisdiction; and, secondly, in the equality of benefice.
 In all presbyterian churches the equality of authority is perfect: that
 of benefice is not so. The difference, however, between one benefice
and another, is seldom so considerable as commonly to tempt the
possessor even of the small one<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt502" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt502_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 to pay court to his patron, by the vile arts of flattery and
assentation, in order to get a better. In all the presbyterian churches,
 where the rights of patronage are thoroughly established, it is by
nobler and better arts that the established clergy in general endeavour
to gain the favour of their superiors; by their learning, by the
irreproachable regularity of their life, and by the faithful <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>295<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 and diligent discharge of their duty. Their patrons even frequently
complain of the independency of their spirit, which they are apt to
construe into ingratitude for past favours, but which at worst, perhaps,
 is seldom any more than that indifference which naturally arises from
the consciousness that no further favours of the kind are ever to be
expected. There is scarce perhaps to be found any where in Europe a more
 learned, decent, independent, and respectable set of men, than the
greater part of the presbyterian clergy of Holland, Geneva, Switzerland,
 and Scotland.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_712">Where the church benefices are all nearly equal, none of them can be<span class="type-margin"><span>The mediocrity of their benefices gives them influence with the common people</span></span>
 very great, and this mediocrity of benefice, though it may no doubt be
carried too far, has, however, some very agreeable effects. Nothing but
the most exemplary morals can give dignity to a man of small fortune.
The vices of levity and vanity necessarily render him ridiculous, and
are, besides, almost as ruinous to him as they are to the common people.
 In his own conduct, therefore, he is obliged to follow that system of
morals which the common people respect the most. He gains their esteem
and affection by that plan of life which his own interest and situation
would lead him to follow. The common people look upon him with that
kindness with which we naturally regard one who approaches somewhat to
our own condition, but who, we think, ought to be in a higher. Their
kindness naturally provokes his kindness. He becomes careful to instruct
 them, and attentive to assist and relieve them. He does not even
despise the prejudices of people who are disposed to be so favourable to
 him, and never treats them with those contemptuous and arrogant airs
which we so often meet with in the proud dignitaries of opulent and
well-endowed churches. The presbyterian clergy, accordingly, have more
influence over the minds of the common people than perhaps the clergy of
 any other established church. It is accordingly in presbyterian
countries only that we ever find the common people converted, without
persecution, completely, and almost to a man, to the established church.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_713">In countries where church benefices are the greater part of them<span class="type-margin"><span>It also enables the universities to draw on them for professors, who are thus the most eminent men of letters.</span></span>
 very moderate, a chair in a university is generally a better
establishment than a church benefice. The universities have, in this
case, the picking and chusing of their members from all the churchmen of
 the country, who, in every country, constitute by far the most numerous
 class of men of letters. Where church benefices, on the contrary, are
many of them very considerable, the church naturally draws from the
universities the greater part of their eminent men of letters; who
generally find some patron who does himself honour by procuring them <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>296<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 church preferment. In the former situation we are likely to find the
universities filled with the most eminent men of letters that are to be
found in the country. In the latter we are likely to find few eminent
men among them, and those few among the youngest members of the society,
 who are likely too to be drained away from it, before they can have
acquired experience and knowledge enough to be of much use to it. It is
observed by Mr. de Voltaire, that father Porrée, a jesuit of no great
eminence in the republic of letters, was the only professor they had
ever had in France whose works were worth the reading.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt503" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt503_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 In a country which has produced so many eminent men of letters, it must
 appear somewhat singular, that scarce one of them should have been a
professor in a university. The famous Gassendi was, in the beginning of
his life, a professor in the university of Aix. Upon the first dawning
of his genius, it was represented to him, that by going into the church
he could easily find a much more quiet and comfortable subsistence, as
well as a better situation for pursuing his studies; and he immediately
followed the advice. The observation of Mr. de Voltaire may be applied, I
 believe, not only to France, but to all other Roman catholic countries.
 We very rarely find, in any of them, an eminent man of letters who is a
 professor in a university, except, perhaps, in the professions of law
and physic; professions from which the church is not so likely to draw
them. After the church of Rome, that of England is by far the richest
and best endowed church in Christendom. In England, accordingly, the
church is continually draining the universities of all their best and
ablest members; and an old college tutor, who is known and distinguished
 in Europe as an eminent man of letters, is as rarely to be found there
as in any Roman catholic country. In Geneva, on the contrary, in the
protestant cantons of Switzerland, in the protestant countries of
Germany, in Holland, in Scotland, in Sweden, and Denmark, the most
eminent men of letters whom those countries have produced, have, not all
 indeed, but the far greater part of them, been professors in
universities. In those countries the universities are continually
draining the church of all its most eminent men of letters.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_714"><span class="type-margin"><span>Eminent men of letters in Greece and Rome were mostly teachers.</span></span>It
 may, perhaps, be worth while to remark, that, if we except the poets, a
 few orators, and a few historians, the far greater part of the other
eminent men of letters, both of Greece and Rome, appear to <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>297<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 have been either public or private teachers; generally either of
philosophy or of rhetoric. This remark will be found to hold true from
the days of Lysias and Isocrates, of Plato and Aristotle, down to those
of Plutarch and Epictetus, of Suetonius and Quintilian.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt504" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt504_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 To impose upon any man the necessity of teaching, year after year, any
particular branch of science, seems, in reality, to be the most
effectual method for rendering him completely master of it himself. By
being obliged to go every year over the same ground, if he is good for
any thing, he necessarily becomes, in a few years, well acquainted with
every part of it: and if upon any particular point he should form too
hasty an opinion one year, when he comes in the course of his lectures
to re-consider the same subject the year thereafter, he is very likely
to correct it.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt505" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt505_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 As to be a teacher of science is certainly the natural employment of a
mere man of letters; so is it likewise, perhaps, the education which is
most likely to render him a man of solid learning and knowledge. The
mediocrity of church benefices naturally tends to draw the greater part
of men of letters, in the country where it takes place, to the
employment in which they can be the most useful to the public, and, at
the same time, to give them the best education, perhaps, they are
capable of receiving. It tends to render their learning both as solid as
 possible, and as useful as possible.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_715">The revenue of every established church, such parts of it excepted<span class="type-margin"><span>The revenue of the church, except that part which arises from endowments is a branch of that of the state</span></span>
 as may arise from particular lands or manors, is a branch, it ought to
be observed, of the general revenue of the state, which is thus diverted
 to a purpose very different from the defence of the state. The tythe,
for example, is a real land-tax, which puts it out of the power of the
proprietors of land to contribute so largely towards the defence of the
state as they otherwise might be able to do. The rent of land, however,
is, according to some, the sole fund, and according to others, the
principal fund, from which, in all great monarchies, the exigencies of
the state must be ultimately supplied. The more of this fund that is
given to the church, the less, it is evident, can be spared to the
state. It may be laid down as a certain maxim, that, all other things
being supposed equal, the richer the church, the poorer must necessarily
 be, either the sovereign on the one hand, or the people on the other;
and, in all cases, the less able must the state be to defend itself. In<span class="type-margin"><span>In some cantons of Switzerland the old revenue of the church now maintains both church and state</span></span> several protestant countries, particularly in all the protestant cantons <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>298<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of Switzerland, the revenue which anciently belonged to the Roman
catholic church, the tythes and church lands, has been found a fund
sufficient, not only to afford competent salaries to the established
clergy, but to defray, with little or no addition, all the other
expences of the state. The magistrates of the powerful canton of Berne,
in particular, have accumulated out of the savings from this fund a very
 large sum, supposed to amount to several millions, part of which is
deposited in a public treasure, and part is placed at interest in what
are called the public funds of the different indebted nations of Europe;
 chiefly in those of France and Great Britain. What may be the amount of
 the whole expence which the church, either of Berne, or of any other
protestant canton, costs the state, I do not pretend to know.<span class="type-margin"><span>The whole revenue of the Church of Scotland is a trifling amount, but that church produces all possible good effects</span></span>
 By a very exact account it appears, that, in 1755, the whole revenue of
 the clergy of the church of Scotland, including their glebe or church
lands, and the rent of their manses or dwelling-houses, estimated
according to a reasonable valuation, amounted only to 68,514 <span class="ital">l.</span> 1 <span class="ital">s.</span> 5 <span class="ital">d.</span>
 1/12. This very moderate revenue affords a decent subsistence to nine
hundred and forty-four ministers. The whole expence of the church,
including what is occasionally laid out for the building and reparation
of churches, and of the manses of ministers, cannot well be supposed to
exceed eighty or eighty-five thousand pounds a-year. The most opulent
church in Christendom does not maintain better the uniformity of faith,
the fervour of devotion, the spirit of order, regularity, and austere
morals in the great body of the people, than this very poorly endowed
church of Scotland. All the good effects, both civil and religious,
which an established church can be supposed<span class="type-margin"><span>This is also true in a still higher degree of the Swiss Protestant churches</span></span>
 to produce, are produced by it as completely as by any other. The
greater part of the protestant churches of Switzerland, which in general
 are not better endowed than the church of Scotland, produce those
effects in a still higher degree. In the greater part of the protestant
cantons, there is not a single person to be found who does not profess
himself to be of the established church. If he professes himself to be
of any other, indeed, the law obliges him to leave the canton. But so
severe, or rather indeed so oppressive a law, could never have been
executed in such free countries, had not the diligence of the clergy
before-hand converted to the established church the whole body of the
people, with the exception of, perhaps, a few individuals only. In some
parts of Switzerland, accordingly, where, from the accidental union of a
 protestant and Roman catholic country, the conversion has not been so
complete, both religions are not only tolerated but established by law.</p>

<p id="Smith_0206-02_716">The proper performance of every service seems to require that its<span class="type-margin"><span>Large revenue is unsuitable to the office of clergymen</span></span>
 pay or recompence should be, as exactly as possible, proportioned to
the nature of the service. If any service is very much under-paid, it is
 very apt to suffer by the meanness and incapacity of the greater part
of those who are employed in it. If it is very much over-paid, it is apt
 to suffer, perhaps, still more by their negligence and idleness. A man
of a large revenue, whatever may be his profession, thinks he ought to
live like other men of large revenues; and to spend a great part of his
time in festivity, in vanity, and in dissipation. But in a clergyman
this train of life not only consumes the time which ought to be employed
 in the duties of his function, but in the eyes of the common people
destroys almost entirely that sanctity of character which can alone
enable him to perform those duties with proper weight and authority.</p>

the different orders of people are growing every day more expensive in
their houses, in their furniture, in their tables, in their dress, and
in their equipage; it cannot well be expected that the sovereign should
alone hold out against the fashion. He naturally, therefore, or rather
necessarily becomes more expensive in all those different articles too.
His dignity even seems to require that he should become so.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_719">As in point of dignity, a monarch is more raised above his subjects<span class="type-margin"><span>and is greater in a monarchy than in a republic</span></span>
 than the chief magistrate of any republic is ever supposed to be above

<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-02_720"><span class="type-margin"><span>The expense of defence and of maintaining the dignity of the sovereign should be paid by general contribution.</span></span>THE
 expence of defending the society, and that of supporting the dignity of
 the chief magistrate, are both laid out for the general benefit of the
whole society. It is reasonable, therefore, that they should be defrayed
 by the general contribution of the whole society, all the different
members contributing, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their
respective abilities.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_721"><span class="type-margin"><span>But the expense of justice may be defrayed by fees of court.</span></span>The
 expence of the administration of justice too, may, no doubt, be
considered as laid out for the benefit of the whole society. There is no
 impropriety, therefore, in its being defrayed by the general
contribution of the whole society. The persons, however, who give
occasion to this expence are those who, by their injustice in one way or
 another, make it necessary to seek redress or protection from the
courts of justice. The persons again most immediately benefited by this
expence, are those whom the courts of justice either restore to their
rights, or maintain in their rights. The expence of the administration
of justice, therefore, may very properly be defrayed by the particular
contribution of one or other, or both of those two different sets of
persons, according as different occasions may require, that is, by the
fees of court. It cannot be necessary to have recourse to the general
contribution of the whole society, except for the conviction of those
criminals who have not themselves any estate or fund sufficient for
paying those fees.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_722"><span class="type-margin"><span>and expenses of local benefit ought to be defrayed by local revenue</span></span>Those
 local or provincial expences of which the benefit is local or
provincial (what is laid out, for example, upon the police of a
particular town or district) ought to be defrayed by a local or
provincial revenue, and ought to be no burden upon the general revenue
of the society. It is unjust that the whole society should contribute
towards an expence of which the benefit is confined to a part of the
society.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_723"><span class="type-margin"><span>The expense of roads may not unjustly be defrayed by general contribution, but better by tolls.</span></span>The
 expence of maintaining good roads and communications is, no doubt,
beneficial to the whole society, and may, therefore, without any
injustice, be defrayed by the general contribution of the whole society.
 This expence, however, is most immediately and directly beneficial to
those who travel or carry goods from one place to another, and to those
who consume such goods. The turnpike tolls in England, and the duties
called peages in other countries, lay it altogether upon those two
different sets of people, and thereby discharge the general revenue of
the society from a very considerable burden.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_724"><span class="type-margin"><span>The expense of
 education and religious instruction may also be defrayed by general
contribution, but better by fees and voluntary contribution.</span></span>The
 expence of the institutions for education and religious instruction, is
 likewise, no doubt, beneficial to the whole society, and may, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>301<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 therefore, without injustice, be defrayed by the general contribution
of the whole society. This expence, however, might perhaps with equal
propriety, and even with some advantage, be defrayed altogether by those
 who receive the immediate benefit of such education and instruction, or
 by the voluntary contribution of those who think they have occasion for
 either the one or the other.</p>

 whole society, either cannot be maintained altogether, or are not
maintained altogether by the contribution of such particular members of
the society as are most immediately benefited by them, the deficiency
must in most cases be made up by the general contribution of the whole
society. The general revenue of the society, over and above defraying
the expence of defending the society, and of supporting the dignity of
the chief magistrate, must make up for the deficiency of many particular
 branches of revenue. The sources of this general or public revenue, I
shall endeavour to explain in the following chapter.</p>

<h2 id="lf0206-02_label_570">PART I: <span class="ital">Of the Funds or Sources of Revenue which may peculiarly belong to the Sovereign or Commonwealth</span></h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-02_727"><span class="type-margin"><span>The property may be in stock or land.</span></span>THE
 funds or sources of revenue which may peculiarly belong to the
sovereign or commonwealth must consist, either in stock, or in land.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_728"><span class="type-margin"><span>Revenue from stock may be profit or interest.</span></span>The
 sovereign, like any other owner of stock, may derive a revenue from it,
 either by employing it himself, or by lending it. His revenue is in the
 one case profit, in the other interest.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_729"><span class="type-margin"><span>Tartar and Arabian chiefs make profit from herds and flocks,</span></span>The
 revenue of a Tartar or Arabian chief consists in profit. It arises
principally from the milk and increase of his own herds and flocks, of
which he himself superintends the management, and is the principal
shepherd or herdsman of his own horde or tribe. It is, however, in this
earliest and rudest state of civil government only that profit has ever
made the principal part of the public revenue of a monarchical state.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_730"><span class="type-margin"><span>Hamburg from a wine cellar and apothecary’s shop, and many states from banks</span></span>Small
 republics have sometimes derived a considerable revenue from the profit
 of mercantile projects. The republic of Hamburgh is said <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>303<span class="bracket">]</span></span> to do so from the profits of a public wine cellar and apothecary’s shop.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt507" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt507_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The state cannot be very great of which the sovereign has leisure to
carry on the trade of a wine merchant or apothecary. The profit of a
public bank has been a source of revenue to more considerable states. It
 has been so not only to Hamburgh, but to Venice and Amsterdam. A
revenue of this kind has even by some people been thought not below the
attention of so great an empire as that of Great Britain. Reckoning the
ordinary dividend of the bank of England at five and a half per cent.
and its capital at ten millions seven hundred and eighty thousand
pounds, the neat annual profit, after paying the expence of management,
must amount, it is said, to five hundred and ninety-two thousand nine
hundred pounds. Government, it is pretended, could borrow this capital
at three per cent. interest, and by taking the management of the bank
into its own hands, might make a clear profit of two hundred and
sixty-nine thousand five hundred pounds a year. The orderly, vigilant,
and parsimonious administration of such aristocracies as those of Venice
 and Amsterdam, is extremely proper, it appears from experience, for the
 management of a mercantile project of this kind. But whether such a
government as that of England; which, whatever may be its virtues, has
never been famous for good œconomy; which, in time of peace, has
generally conducted itself with the slothful and negligent profusion
that is perhaps natural to monarchies; and in time of war has constantly
 acted with all the thoughtless extravagance that democracies are apt to
 fall into; could be safely trusted with the management of such a
project, must at least be a good deal more doubtful.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_731">The post office is properly a mercantile project. The government<span class="type-margin"><span>and post offices</span></span>
 advances the expence of establishing the different offices, and of
buying or hiring the necessary horses or carriages, and is repaid with a
 large profit by the duties upon what is carried. It is perhaps the only
 mercantile project which has been successfully managed by, I believe,
every sort of government. The capital to be advanced is not very
considerable. There is no mystery in the business. The returns are not
only certain, but immediate.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>304<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_732"><span class="type-margin"><span>But generally princes are unsuccessful as traders.</span></span>Princes,
 however, have frequently engaged in many other mercantile projects, and
 have been willing, like private persons, to mend their fortunes by
becoming adventurers in the common branches of trade. They have scarce
ever succeeded. The profusion with which the affairs of princes are
always managed, renders it almost impossible that they should. The
agents of a prince regard the wealth of their master as inexhaustible;
are careless at what price they buy; are careless at what price they
sell; are careless at what expence they transport his goods from one
place to another. Those agents frequently live with the profusion of
princes, and sometimes too, in spite of that profusion, and by a proper
method of making up their accounts, acquire the fortunes of princes. It
was thus, as we are told by Machiavel, that the agents of Lorenzo of
Medicis, not a prince of mean abilities, carried on his trade. The
republic of Florence was several times obliged to pay the debt into
which their extravagance had involved him. He found it convenient,
accordingly, to give up the business of merchant, the business to which
his family had originally owed their fortune, and in the latter part of
his life to employ both what remained of that fortune, and the revenue
of the state of which he had the disposal, in projects and expences more
 suitable to his station.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt508" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt508_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_733"><span class="type-margin"><span>The two characters are inconsistent</span></span>No
 two characters seem more inconsistent than those of trader and
sovereign. If the trading spirit of the English East India company
renders them very bad sovereigns; the spirit of sovereignty seems to
have rendered them equally bad traders. While they were traders only,
they managed their trade successfully, and were able to pay from their
profits a moderate dividend to the proprietors of their stock. Since
they became sovereigns, with a revenue which, it is said, was originally
 more than three millions sterling, they have been obliged to beg the
extraordinary assistance of government in order to avoid immediate
bankruptcy.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt509" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt509_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 In their former situation, their servants in India considered
themselves as the clerks of merchants: in their present situation, those
 servants consider themselves as the ministers of sovereigns.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_734"><span class="type-margin"><span>Treasure may be lent to subjects or foreign states</span></span>A
 state may sometimes derive some part of its public revenue from the
interest of money, as well as from the profits of stock. If it has
amassed a treasure, it may lend a part of that treasure, either to
foreign states, or to its own subjects.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_735"><span class="type-margin"><span>Berne lends to foreign states.</span></span>The
 canton of Berne derives a considerable revenue by lending a part of its
 treasure to foreign states; that is, by placing it in the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>305<span class="bracket">]</span></span> public funds of the different indebted nations of Europe, chiefly in those of France and England.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt510" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt510_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The security of this revenue must depend, first, upon the security of
the funds in which it is placed, or upon the good faith of the
government which has the management of them; and, secondly, upon the
certainty or probability of the continuance of peace with the debtor
nation. In the case of a war, the very first act of hostility, on the
part of the debtor nation, might be the forfeiture of the funds of its
creditor. This policy of lending money to foreign states is, so far as I
 know, peculiar to the canton of Berne.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_736">The city of Hamburgh<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt511" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt511_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> has established a sort of public pawn-shop,<span class="type-margin"><span>Hamburg has a pawn-shop,</span></span>
 which lends money to the subjects of the state upon pledges at six per
cent. interest. This pawn-shop or Lombard, as it is called, affords a
revenue, it is pretended, to the state of a hundred and fifty thousand
crowns, which, at four-and-sixpence the crown, amounts to 33,750 <span class="ital">l.</span> sterling.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_737">The government of Pensylvania, without amassing any treasure,<span class="type-margin"><span>Pennsylvania lent paper money on land security.</span></span>
 invented a method of lending, not money indeed, but what is equivalent
to money, to its subjects. By advancing to private people, at interest,
and upon land security to double the value, paper bills of credit to be
redeemed fifteen years after their date, and in the mean time made
transferrable from hand to hand like bank notes, and declared by act of
assembly to be a legal tender in all payments from one inhabitant of the
 province to another, it raised a moderate revenue, which went a
considerable way towards defraying an annual expence of about 4,500 <span class="ital">l.</span>
 the whole ordinary expence of that frugal and orderly government. The
success of an expedient of this kind must have depended upon three
different circumstances; first, upon the demand for some other
instrument of commerce, besides gold and silver money; or upon the
demand for such a quantity of consumable stock, as could not be had
without sending abroad the greater part of their gold and silver money,
in order to purchase it; secondly, upon the good credit of the
government which made use of this expedient; and, thirdly, upon the
moderation with which it was used, the whole value of the paper bills of
 credit never exceeding that of the gold and silver money which would
have been necessary for carrying on their circulation, had there been no
 paper bills of credit. The same expedient was upon different occasions
adopted by several other American colonies: but, from want of this
moderation, it produced, in the greater part of them, much more disorder
 than conveniency.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>306<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_738"><span class="type-margin"><span>No great revenue can be derived from such a source.</span></span>The
 unstable and perishable nature of stock and credit, however, render
them unfit to be trusted to, as the principal funds of that sure, steady
 and permanent revenue, which can alone give security and dignity to
government. The government of no great nation, that was advanced beyond
the shepherd state, seems ever to have derived the greater part of its
public revenue from such sources.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_739"><span class="type-margin"><span>Revenue from land is much more important,</span></span>Land
 is a fund of a more stable and permanent nature; and the rent of public
 lands, accordingly, has been the principal source of the public revenue
 of many a great nation that was much advanced beyond the shepherd
state. From the produce or rent of the public lands, the ancient
republics of Greece and Italy derived, for a long time, the greater part
 of that revenue which defrayed the necessary expences of the
commonwealth. The rent of the crown lands constituted for a long time
the greater part of the revenue of the ancient sovereigns of Europe.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_740"><span class="type-margin"><span>especially when war cost little, as in ancient Greece and Italy,</span></span>War
 and the preparation for war, are the two circumstances which in modern
times occasion the greater part of the necessary expence of all great
states. But in the ancient republics of Greece and Italy every citizen
was a soldier, who both served and prepared himself for service at his
own expence. Neither of those two circumstances, therefore, could
occasion any very considerable expence to the state. The rent of a very
moderate landed estate might be fully sufficient for defraying all the
other necessary expences of government.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_741"><span class="type-margin"><span>and in feudal times, when all expenses were small.</span></span>In
 the ancient monarchies of Europe, the manners and customs of the times
sufficiently prepared the great body of the people for war; and when
they took the field, they were, by the condition of their feudal
tenures, to be maintained, either at their own expence, or at that of
their immediate lords, without bringing any new charge upon the
sovereign. The other expences of government were, the greater part of
them, very moderate. The administration of justice, it has been shown,
instead of being a cause of expence, was a source of revenue. The labour
 of the country people, for three days before and for three days after
harvest, was thought a fund sufficient for making and maintaining all
the bridges, highways, and other public works which the commerce of the
country was supposed to require. In those days the principal expence of
the sovereign seems to have consisted in the maintenance of his own
family and household. The officers of his houshold, accordingly, were
then the great officers of state. The lord treasurer received his rents.
 The lord steward and lord chamberlain looked after the expence of his
family. The care of his stables was committed to the lord constable and
the lord marshal. <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>307<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 His houses were all built in the form of castles, and seem to have been
 the principal fortresses which he possessed. The keepers of those
houses or castles might be considered as a sort of military governors.
They seem to have been the only military officers whom it was necessary
to maintain in time of peace. In these circumstances the rent of a great
 landed estate might, upon ordinary occasions, very well defray all the
necessary expences of government.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_742">In the present state of the greater part of the civilized monarchies of<span class="type-margin"><span>The present rent of all the land in the country would not suffice for the ordinary expenditure</span></span>
 Europe, the rent of all the lands in the country, managed as they
probably would be if they all belonged to one proprietor, would scarce
perhaps amount to the ordinary revenue which they levy upon the people
even in peaceable times. The ordinary revenue of Great Britain, for
example, including not only what is necessary for defraying the current
expence of the year, but for paying the interest of the public debts,
and for sinking a part of the capital of those debts, amounts to upwards
 of ten millions a year. But the land tax, at four shillings in the
pound, falls short of two millions a year. This land tax, as it is
called, however, is supposed to be one-fifth, not only of the rent of
all the land, but of that of all the houses, and of the interest of all
the capital stock of Great Britain, that part of it only excepted which
is either lent to the public, or employed as farming stock in the
cultivation of land. A very considerable part of the produce of this tax
 arises from the rent of houses, and the interest of capital stock. The
land-tax of the city of London, for example, at four shillings in the
pound, amounts to 123,399 <span class="ital">l.</span> 6 <span class="ital">s.</span> 7 <span class="ital">d.</span> That of the city of Westminster, to 63,092 <span class="ital">l.</span> 1 <span class="ital">s.</span> 5 <span class="ital">d.</span> That of the palaces of Whitehall and St. James’s, to 30,754 <span class="ital">l.</span> 6 <span class="ital">s.</span> 3 <span class="ital">d.</span><a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt512" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt512_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 A certain proportion of the land-tax is in the same manner assessed
upon all the other cities and towns corporate in the kingdom, and arises
 almost altogether, either from the rent of houses, or from what is
supposed to be the interest of trading and capital stock. According to
the estimation, therefore, by which Great Britain is rated to the
land-tax, the whole mass of revenue arising from the rent of all the
lands, from that of all the houses, and from the interest of all the
capital stock, that part of it only excepted which is either lent to the
 public, or employed in the cultivation of land, does not exceed ten
millions sterling a year, the ordinary revenue which government levies
upon the people even in peaceable times. The estimation by which Great
Britain is rated to the land-tax is, no doubt, taking the whole kingdom
at an average, very much below the real value; though in several
particular counties and districts it is said to <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>308<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 be nearly equal to that value. The rent of the lands alone, exclusive
of that of houses, and of the interest of stock, has by many people been
 estimated at twenty millions, an estimation made in a great measure at
random, and which, I apprehend, is as likely to be above as below<span class="type-margin"><span>but if the whole of the land of the country were under the extravagant management of the state, the rent would be much reduced.</span></span> the truth.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt513" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt513_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 But if the lands of Great Britain, in the present state of their
cultivation, do not afford a rent of more than twenty millions a year,
they could not well afford the half, most probably not the fourth part
of that rent, if they all belonged to a single proprietor, and were put
under the negligent, expensive, and oppressive management of his factors
 and agents. The crown lands of Great Britain do not at present afford
the fourth part of the rent, which could probably be drawn from them if
they were the property of private persons. If the crown lands were more
extensive, it is probable they would be still worse managed.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_743"><span class="type-margin"><span>and the revenue of the people would be reduced by a still greater amount.</span></span>The
 revenue which the great body of the people derives from land is in
proportion, not to the rent, but to the produce of the land. The whole
annual produce of the land of every country, if we except what is
reserved for seed, is either annually consumed by the great body of the
people, or exchanged for something else that is consumed by them.
Whatever keeps down the produce of the land below what it would
otherwise rise to, keeps down the revenue of the great body of the
people, still more than it does that of the proprietors of land. The
rent of land, that portion of the produce which belongs to the
proprietors, is scarce anywhere in Great Britain supposed to be more
than a third part of the whole produce. If the land, which in one state
of cultivation affords a rent of ten millions sterling a year, would in
another afford a rent of twenty millions; the rent being, in both cases,
 supposed a third part of the produce; the revenue of the proprietors
would be less than it otherwise might be by ten millions a year only;
but the revenue of the great body of the people would be less than it
otherwise might be by thirty millions a year, deducting only what would
be necessary for seed. The population of the country would be less by
the number of people which thirty millions a year, deducting always the
seed, could maintain, according to the particular mode of living and
expence which might take place in the different ranks of men among whom
the remainder was distributed.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_744"><span class="type-margin"><span>The sale of crown lands would benefit both sovereign and people</span></span>Though
 there is not at present, in Europe, any civilized state of any kind
which derives the greater part of its public revenue from the rent of
lands which are the property of the state; yet, in all the great
monarchies of Europe, there are still many large tracts of land which <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>309<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 belong to the crown. They are generally forest; and sometimes forest
where, after travelling several miles, you will scarce find a single
tree; a mere waste and loss of country in respect both of produce and
population. In every great monarchy of Europe the sale of the crown
lands would produce a very large sum of money, which, if applied to the
payment of the public debts, would deliver from mortgage a much greater
revenue than any which those lands have ever afforded to the crown. In
countries where lands, improved and cultivated very highly, and yielding
 at the time of sale as great a rent as can easily be got from them,
commonly sell at thirty years purchase; the unimproved, uncultivated,
and low-rented crown lands might well be expected to sell at forty,
fifty, or sixty years purchase. The crown might immediately enjoy the
revenue which this great price would redeem from mortgage. In the course
 of a few years it would probably enjoy another revenue. When the crown
lands had become private property, they would, in the course of a few
years, become well-improved and well-cultivated. The increase of their
produce would increase the population of the country, by augmenting the
revenue and consumption of the people. But the revenue which the crown
derives from the duties of customs and excise, would necessarily
increase with the revenue and consumption of the people.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_745">The revenue which, in any civilized monarchy, the crown derives<span class="type-margin"><span>The revenue from crown lands costs the people more than any other.</span></span>
 from the crown lands, though it appears to cost nothing to individuals,
 in reality costs more to the society than perhaps any other equal
revenue which the crown enjoys. It would, in all cases, be for the
interest of the society to replace this revenue to the crown by some
other equal revenue, and to divide the lands among the people, which
could not well be done better, perhaps, than by exposing them to public
sale.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_746">Lands, for the purposes of pleasure and magnificence, parks, gardens,<span class="type-margin"><span>Publicparks etc., are the only lands which should belong to the sovereign.</span></span>
 public walks, &amp;c. possessions which are every where considered as
causes of expence, not as sources of revenue, seem to be the only lands
which, in a great and civilized monarchy, ought to belong to the crown.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_747">Public stock and public lands, therefore, the two sources of revenue<span class="type-margin"><span>The greater part of the sovereign’s expense must be defrayed by taxes.</span></span>
 which may peculiarly belong to the sovereign or commonwealth, being
both improper and insufficient funds for defraying the necessary expence
 of any great and civilized state; it remains that this expence must,
the greater part of it, be defrayed by taxes of one kind or another; the
 people contributing a part of their own private revenue in order to
make up a public revenue to the sovereign or commonwealth.</p>

<h2 id="lf0206-02_label_578">PART II: <span class="ital">Of Taxes</span></h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-02_748"><span class="type-margin"><span>Taxes may be intended to fall on rent, profit, or wages, or upon all three sorts of revenue.</span></span>THE
 private revenue of individuals, it has been shewn in the first book of
this Inquiry, arises ultimately from three different sources; Rent,
Profit, and Wages. Every tax must finally be paid from some one or other
 of those three different sorts of revenue, or from all of them
indifferently. I shall endeavour to give the best account I can, first,
of those taxes which, it is intended, should fall upon rent; secondly,
of those which, it is intended, should fall upon profit; thirdly, of
those which, it is intended, should fall upon wages; and, fourthly, of
those which, it is intended, should fall indifferently upon all those
three different sources of private revenue. The particular consideration
 of each of these four different sorts of taxes will divide the second
part of the present chapter into four articles, three of which will
require several other subdivisions. Many of those taxes, it will appear
from the following review, are not finally paid from the fund, or source
 of revenue, upon which it was intended they should fall.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_749"><span class="type-margin"><span>There are four maxims with regard to taxes in general,</span></span>Before
 I enter upon the examination of particular taxes, it is necessary to
premise the four following maxims with regard to taxes in general.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_750"><span class="type-margin"><span>(1) equality,</span></span><span id="lf0206-02_label_579">I.</span>
 The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of
the government, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective
 abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they
respectively enjoy under the protection of the state. The expence of
government to the individuals of a great nation, is like the expence of
management to the joint tenants of a great estate, who are all obliged
to contribute in proportion to their respective interests in the estate.
 In the observation or neglect of this maxim consists, what is called
the equality or inequality of taxation. Every tax, it must be observed
once for all, which falls finally upon one only of the three sorts of
revenue above mentioned, is necessarily unequal, in so far as it does
not affect the other two. In the following examination of different
taxes I shall seldom take much further notice of this sort of
inequality, but shall, in most cases, confine my observations to that
inequality which is occasioned by a particular tax falling unequally
even upon that particular sort of private revenue which is affected by
it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_751"><span class="type-margin"><span>(2) certainty,</span></span><span id="lf0206-02_label_580">II.</span>
 The tax which each individual is bound to pay ought to be certain, and
not arbitrary. The time of payment, the manner of payment, the quantity
to be paid, ought all to be clear and plain to the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>311<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 contributor, and to every other person. Where it is otherwise, every
person subject to the tax is put more or less in the power of the
taxgatherer, who can either aggravate the tax upon any obnoxious
contributor, or extort, by the terror of such aggravation, some present
or perquisite to himself. The uncertainty of taxation encourages the
insolence and favours the corruption of an order of men who are
naturally unpopular, even where they are neither insolent nor corrupt.
The certainty of what each individual ought to pay is, in taxation, a
matter of so great importance, that a very considerable degree of
inequality, it appears, I believe, from the experience of all nations,
is not near so great an evil as a very small degree of uncertainty.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_752"><span id="lf0206-02_label_581">III.</span> Every tax ought to be levied at the time, or in the manner, in<span class="type-margin"><span>(3) convenience of payment,</span></span>
 which it is most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it.
 A tax upon the rent of land or of houses, payable at the same term at
which such rents are usually paid, is levied at the time when it is most
 likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay; or, when he is most
 likely to have wherewithal to pay. Taxes upon such consumable goods as
are articles of luxury, are all finally paid by the consumer, and
generally in a manner that is very convenient for him. He pays them by
little and little, as he has occasion to buy the goods. As he is at
liberty too, either to buy, or not to buy, as he pleases, it must be his
 own fault if he ever suffers any considerable inconveniency from such
taxes.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_753"><span id="lf0206-02_label_582">IV.</span> Every tax ought to be so contrived as both to take out and to<span class="type-margin"><span>and (4) economy in collection,</span></span>
 keep out of the pockets of the people as little as possible, over and
above what it brings into the public treasury of the state. A tax may
either take out or keep out of the pockets of the people a great deal
more than it brings into the public treasury, in the four following
ways. First, the levying of it may require a great number of officers,
whose salaries may eat up the greater part of the produce of the tax,
and whose perquisites may impose another additional tax upon the people.
 Secondly, it may obstruct the industry of the people, and discourage
them from applying to certain branches of business which might give
maintenance and employment to great multitudes. While it obliges the
people to pay, it may thus diminish, or perhaps destroy, some of the
funds which might enable them more easily to do so. Thirdly, by the
forfeitures and other penalties which those unfortunate individuals
incur who attempt unsuccessfully to evade the tax, it may frequently
ruin them, and thereby put an end to the benefit which the community
might have received from the employment of their capitals. An
injudicious tax offers a great temptation to smuggling. But the
penalties <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>312<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of smuggling must rise in proportion to the temptation. The law,
contrary to all the ordinary principles of justice, first creates the
temptation, and then punishes those who yield to it; and it commonly
enhances the punishment too in proportion to the very circumstance which
 ought certainly to alleviate it, the temptation to commit the crime.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt514" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt514_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Fourthly, by subjecting the people to the frequent visits and the
odious examination of the tax-gatherers, it may expose them to much
unnecessary trouble, vexation, and oppression; and though vexation is
not, strictly speaking, expence, it is certainly equivalent to the
expence at which every man would be willing to redeem himself from it.
It is in some one or other of these four different ways that taxes are
frequently so much more burdensome to the people than they are
beneficial to the sovereign.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_754"><span class="type-margin"><span>which have recommended themselves to all nations</span></span>The
 evident justice and utility of the foregoing maxims have recommended
them more or less to the attention of all nations. All nations have
endeavoured, to the best of their judgment, to render their taxes as
equal as they could contrive; as certain, as convenient to the
contributor, both in the time and in the mode of payment, and in
proportion to the revenue which they brought to the prince, as little
burdensome to the people.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt515" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt515_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 The following short review of some of the principal taxes which have
taken place in different ages and countries will show, that the
endeavours of all nations have not in this respect been equally
successful.</p>
<div id="lf0206-02_div_031" class="type-section">
<h2 id="lf0206-02_label_585"><span class="csc">Article</span> I: <span class="ital">Taxes upon Rent. Taxes upon the Rent of Land</span></h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-02_755"><span class="type-margin"><span>A tax on the rent of land may be on a constant or variable valuation.</span></span>A
 TAX upon the rent of land may either be imposed according to a certain
canon, every district being valued at a certain rent, which valuation is
 not afterwards to be altered; or it may be imposed in such a manner as
to vary with every variation in the real rent of the land, and to rise
or fall with the improvement or declension of its cultivation.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>313<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_756">A land-tax which, like that of Great Britain, is assessed upon each<span class="type-margin"><span>If on a constant valuation it becomes unequal, like the British land tax</span></span> district according to<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt516" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt516_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 a certain invariable canon, though it should be equal at the time of
its first establishment, necessarily becomes unequal in process of time,
 according to the unequal degrees of improvement or neglect in the
cultivation of the different parts of the country. In England, the
valuation according to which the different counties and parishes were
assessed to the land-tax by the 4th of William and Mary was very unequal
 even at its first establishment. This tax, therefore, so far offends
against the first of the four maxims above-mentioned. It is perfectly
agreeable to the other three. It is perfectly certain. The time of
payment for the tax, being the same as that for the rent, is as
convenient as it can be to the contributor. Though the landlord is in
all cases the real contributor, the tax is commonly advanced by the
tenant, to whom the landlord is obliged to allow it in the payment of
the rent. This tax is levied by a much smaller number of officers than
any other which affords nearly the same revenue. As the tax upon each
district does not rise with the rise of the rent, the sovereign does not
 share in the profits of the landlord’s improvements. Those improvements
 sometimes contribute,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt517" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt517_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 indeed, to the discharge of the other landlords of the district. But
the aggravation of the tax, which this may sometimes occasion upon a
particular estate, is always so very small, that it never can discourage
 those improvements,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt518" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt518_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 nor keep down the produce of the land below what it would otherwise
rise to. As it has no tendency to diminish the quantity, it can have
none to raise the price of that produce. It does not obstruct the
industry of the people. It subjects the landlord to no other
inconveniency besides the unavoidable one of paying the tax.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_757">The advantage, however, which the landlord has derived from the<span class="type-margin"><span>Circumstances
 have made the constant valuation favourable to the British landlords,
the country having prospered and rents risen,</span></span> invariable
constancy of the valuation by which all the lands of Great Britain are
rated to the land-tax, has been principally owing to some circumstances
altogether extraneous to the nature of the tax.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_758">It has been owing in part to the great
prosperity of almost every part of the country, the rents of almost all
the estates of Great Britain having, since the time when this valuation
was first established, been continually rising, and scarce any of them
having fallen. The landlords, therefore, have almost all gained the
difference between the tax which they would have paid, according to the
present rent of their estates, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>314<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 and that which they actually pay according to the ancient valuation.
Had the state of the country been different, had rents been gradually
falling in consequence of the declension of cultivation, the landlords
would almost all have lost this difference. In the state of things which
 has happened to take place since the revolution, the constancy of the
valuation has been advantageous to the landlord and hurtful to the
sovereign. In a different state of things it might have been
advantageous to the sovereign and hurtful to the landlord.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_759"><span class="type-margin"><span>and the value of money and silver remained uniform</span></span>As
 the tax is made payable in money, so the valuation of the land is
expressed in money. Since the establishment of this valuation the value
of silver has been pretty uniform, and there has been no alteration in
the standard of the coin either as to weight or fineness. Had silver
risen considerably in its value, as it seems to have done in the course
of the two centuries which preceded the discovery of the mines of
America, the constancy of the valuation might have proved very
oppressive to the landlord. Had silver fallen considerably in its value,
 as it certainly did for about a century at least after the discovery of
 those mines, the same constancy of valuation would have reduced very
much this branch of the revenue of the sovereign. Had any considerable
alteration been made in the standard of the money, either by sinking the
 same quantity of silver to a lower denomination, or by raising it to a
higher; had an ounce of silver, for example, instead of being coined
into five shillings and twopence, been coined, either into pieces which
bore so low a denomination as two shillings and seven-pence, or into
pieces which bore so high a one as ten shillings and four-pence, it
would in the one case have hurt the revenue of the proprietor, in the
other that of the sovereign.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_760"><span class="type-margin"><span>The constancy of valuation might have been very inconvenient to one or other of the parties</span></span>In
 circumstances, therefore, somewhat different from those which have
actually taken place, this constancy of valuation might have been a very
 great inconveniency, either to the contributors, or to the
commonwealth. In the course of ages such circumstances, however, must,
at some time or other, happen. But though empires, like all the other
works of men, have all hitherto proved mortal, yet every empire aims at
immortality. Every constitution, therefore, which it is meant should be
as permanent as the empire itself, ought to be convenient, not in
certain circumstances only, but in all circumstances; or ought to be
suited, not to those circumstances which are transitory, occasional, or
accidental, but to those which are necessary and therefore always the
same.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_761"><span class="type-margin"><span>The French economists recommend a tax varying with the rent.</span></span>A
 tax upon the rent of land which varies with every variation of the
rent, or which rises and falls according to the improvement or neglect <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>315<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of cultivation, is recommended by that sect of men of letters in
France, who call themselves the œconomists, as the most equitable of all
 taxes. All taxes, they pretend, fall ultimately upon the rent of land,
and ought therefore to be imposed equally upon the fund which must
finally pay them. That all taxes ought to fall as equally as possible
upon the fund which must finally pay them, is certainly true. But
without entering into the disagreeable discussion of the metaphysical
arguments by which they support their very ingenious theory, it will
sufficiently appear, from the following review, what are the taxes which
 fall finally upon the rent of the land, and what are those which fall
finally upon some other fund.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_762"><span class="type-margin"><span>In the Venetian territory rented lands are taxed 10 per cent, and lands cultivated by the proprietor 8 per cent</span></span>In the Venetian territory all the arable lands which are given in lease to farmers are taxed at a tenth of the rent.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt519" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt519_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The leases are recorded in a public register which is kept by the
officers of revenue in each province or district. When the proprietor
cultivates his own lands, they are valued according to an equitable
estimation, and he is allowed a deduction of one-fifth of the tax, so
that for such lands he pays only eight instead of ten per cent. of the
supposed rent.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_763">A land-tax of this kind is certainly more
equal than the land-tax of England. It might not, perhaps, be altogether
 so certain, and the assessment of the tax might frequently occasion a
good deal more trouble to the landlord. It might too be a good deal more
 expensive in the levying.<span class="type-margin"><span>Such a land
tax is more equal but is not so certain, and is more troublesome and
expensive than the British. The uncertainty and expense could be
diminished Leases should be registered.</span></span></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_764">Such a system of administration, however,
might perhaps be contrived as would, in a great measure, both prevent
this uncertainty and moderate this expence.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_765">The landlord and tenant, for example, might
jointly be obliged to record their lease in a public register. Proper
penalties might be enacted against concealing or misrepresenting any of
the conditions; and if part of those penalties were to be paid to either
 of the two parties who informed against and convicted the other of such
 concealment or misrepresentation, it would effectually deter them from
combining together in order to defraud the public revenue. All the
conditions of the lease might be sufficiently known from such a record.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_766">Some landlords, instead of raising the rent, take a fine for the renewal<span class="type-margin"><span>fines taxed higher than rent,</span></span>
 of the lease. This practice is in most cases the expedient of a
spendthrift, who for a sum of ready money sells a future revenue of much
 greater value. It is in most cases, therefore, hurtful to the landlord.
 It is frequently hurtful to the tenant, and it is always hurtful to the
 community. It frequently takes from the tenant so great a part of his <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>316<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 capital, and thereby diminishes so much his ability to cultivate the
land, that he finds it more difficult to pay a small rent than it would
otherwise have been to pay a great one. Whatever diminishes his ability
to cultivate, necessarily keeps down, below what it would otherwise have
 been, the most important part of the revenue of the community. By
rendering the tax upon such fines a good deal heavier than upon the
ordinary rent, this hurtful practice might be discouraged, to the no
small advantage of all the different parties concerned, of the landlord,
 of the tenant, of the sovereign, and of the whole community.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_767"><span class="type-margin"><span>conditions of cultivation should be discouraged by high valuation,</span></span>Some
 leases prescribe to the tenant a certain mode of cultivation, and a
certain succession of crops during the whole continuance of the lease.
This condition, which is generally the effect of the landlord’s conceit
of his own superior knowledge (a conceit in most cases very ill
founded), ought always to be considered as an additional rent; as a rent
 in service instead of a rent in money. In order to discourage the
practice, which is generally a foolish one, this species of rent might
be valued rather high, and consequently taxed somewhat higher than
common money rents.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_768"><span class="type-margin"><span>rents payable in kind should be valued high,</span></span>Some
 landlords, instead of a rent in money, require a rent in kind, in corn,
 cattle, poultry, wine, oil, &amp;c. others again require a rent in
service. Such rents are always more hurtful to the tenant than
beneficial to the landlord. They either take more or keep more out of
the pocket of the former, than they put into that of the latter. In
every country where they take place, the tenants are poor and beggarly,
pretty much according to the degree in which they take place. By
valuing, in the same manner, such rents rather high, and consequently
taxing them somewhat higher than common money rents, a practice which is
 hurtful to the whole community might perhaps be sufficiently
discouraged.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_769"><span class="type-margin"><span>and an abatement given to landlords cultivating a certain extent of their land.</span></span>When
 the landlord chose to occupy himself a part of his own lands, the rent
might be valued according to an equitable arbitration of the farmers and
 landlords in the neighbourhood, and a moderate abatement of the tax
might be granted to him, in the same manner as in the Venetian
territory; provided the rent of the lands which he occupied did not
exceed a certain sum. It is of importance that the landlord should be
encouraged to cultivate a part of his own land. His capital is generally
 greater than that of the tenant, and with less skill he can frequently
raise a greater produce. The landlord can afford to try experiments, and
 is generally disposed to do so. His unsuccessful experiments occasion
only a moderate loss to himself. His successful <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>317<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 ones contribute to the improvement and better cultivation of the whole
country. It might be of importance, however, that the abatement of the
tax should encourage him to cultivate to a certain extent only. If the
landlords should, the greater part of them, be tempted to farm the whole
 of their own lands, the country (instead of sober and industrious
tenants, who are bound by their own interest to cultivate as well as
their capital and skill will allow them) would be filled with idle and
profligate bailiffs, whose abusive management would soon degrade the
cultivation, and reduce the annual produce of the land, to the
diminution, not only of the revenue of their masters, but of the most
important part of that of the whole society.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_770">Such a system of administration might, perhaps, free a tax of this<span class="type-margin"><span>Such a system would free the tax from inconvenient uncertainty and encourage improvement.</span></span>
 kind from any degree of uncertainty which could occasion either
oppression or inconveniency to the contributor; and might at the same
time serve to introduce into the common management of land such a plan
or policy, as might contribute a good deal to the general improvement
and good cultivation of the country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_771">The expence of levying a land-tax, which varied with every variation<span class="type-margin"><span>The extra expense of levying the tax would be inconsiderable.</span></span>
 of the rent, would no doubt be somewhat greater than that of levying
one which was always rated according to a fixed valuation. Some
additional expence would necessarily be incurred both by the different
register offices which it would be proper to establish in the different
districts of the country, and by the different valuations which might
occasionally be made of the lands which the proprietor chose to occupy
himself. The expence of all this, however, might be very moderate, and
much below what is incurred in the levying of many other taxes, which
afford a very inconsiderable revenue in comparison of what might easily
be drawn from a tax of this kind.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_772">The discouragement which a variable land-tax of this kind might<span class="type-margin"><span>The value of improvements should be for a fixed term exempt from taxation,</span></span>
 give to the improvement of land, seems to be the most important
objection which can be made to it. The landlord would certainly be less
disposed to improve, when the sovereign, who contributed nothing to the
expence, was to share in the profit of the improvement. Even this
objection might perhaps be obviated by allowing the landlord, before he
began his improvement, to ascertain, in conjunction with the officers of
 revenue, the actual value of his lands, according to the equitable
arbitration of a certain number of landlords and farmers in the
neighbourhood, equally chosen by both parties; and by rating him
according to this valuation for such a number of years, as might be
fully sufficient for his complete indemnification. To draw the attention
 of the sovereign towards the improvement of the land, from a regard <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>318<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 to the increase of his own revenue, is one of the principal advantages
proposed by this species of land-tax. The term, therefore, allowed for
the indemnification of the landlord, ought not to be a great deal longer
 than what was necessary for that purpose; lest the remoteness of the
interest should discourage too much this attention. It had better,
however, be somewhat too long than in any respect too short. No
incitement to the attention of the sovereign can ever counterbalance the
 smallest discouragement to that of the landlord. The attention of the
sovereign can be at best but a very general and vague consideration of
what is likely to contribute to the better cultivation of the greater
part of his dominions. The attention of the landlord is a particular and
 minute consideration of what is likely to be the most advantageous
application of every inch of ground upon his estate. The principal
attention of the sovereign ought to be to encourage, by every means in
his power, the attention both of the landlord and of the farmer; by
allowing both to pursue their own interest in their own way, and
according to their own judgment; by giving to both the most perfect
security that they shall enjoy the full recompence of their own
industry; and by procuring to both the most extensive market for every
part of their produce, in consequence of establishing the easiest and
safest communications both by land and by water, through every part of
his own dominions, as well as the most unbounded freedom of exportation
to the dominions of all other princes.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_773"><span class="type-margin"><span>and the tax would then be as little inconvenient as is possible.</span></span>If
 by such a system of administration a tax of this kind could be so
managed as to give, not only no discouragement, but, on the contrary,
some encouragement to the improvement of land, it does not appear likely
 to occasion any other inconveniency to the landlord, except always the
unavoidable one of being obliged to pay the tax.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_774"><span class="type-margin"><span>It would adjust itself to all changes.</span></span>In
 all the variations of the state of the society, in the improvement and
in the declension of agriculture; in all the variations in the value of
silver, and in all those in the standard of the coin, a tax of this kind
 would, of its own accord and without any attention of government,
readily suit itself to the actual situation of things, and would be
equally just and equitable in all those different changes. It would,
therefore, be much more proper to be established as a perpetual and
unalterable regulation, or as what is called a fundamental law of the
commonwealth, than any tax which was always to be levied according to a
certain valuation.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_775"><span class="type-margin"><span>Some states make a survey and valuation for the land tax,</span></span>Some
 states, instead of the simple and obvious expedient of a register of
leases, have had recourse to the laborious and expensive one of an
actual survey and valuation of all the lands in the country. They have <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>319<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 suspected, probably, that the lessor and lessee, in order to defraud
the public revenue, might combine to conceal the real terms of the
lease. Doomsday-book seems to have been the result of a very accurate
survey of this kind.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_776">In the ancient dominions of the king of Prussia, the land-tax is<span class="type-margin"><span>for example, Prussia,</span></span> assessed according to an actual survey and valuation, which is reviewed and altered from time to time.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt520" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt520_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>

twenty-five per cent. of their revenue. Ecclesiastics from forty to
forty-five per cent. The survey and valuation<span class="type-margin"><span>Silesia,</span></span>
 of Silesia was made by order of the present king; it is said with great
 accuracy. According to that valuation, the lands belonging to the
bishop of Breslaw are taxed at twenty-five per cent. of their rent. The
other revenues of the ecclesiastics of both religions, at fifty per
cent. The commanderies of the Teutonic order, and of that of Malta, at
forty per cent. Lands held by a noble tenure, at thirty-eight and
one-third per cent. Lands held by a base tenure, at thirty-five and

 The survey of the dutchy of Milan, which was begun in the time of
Charles VI., was not perfected till after 1760. It is esteemed one of
the most accurate that has ever been made. The survey of Savoy and
Piedmont was executed under the orders of the late king of Sardinia.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt523" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt523_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_778">In the dominions of the king of Prussia the revenue of the church is<span class="type-margin"><span>Under the Prussian land tax the church lands are taxed higher than the rest, in some states they are taxed lower than the rest.</span></span> taxed much higher than that of lay proprietors.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt524" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt524_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a>
 The revenue of the church is, the greater part of it, a burden upon the
 rent of land. It seldom happens that any part of it is applied towards
the improvement of land; or is so employed as to contribute in any
respect towards increasing the revenue of the great body of the people.
His Prussian majesty had probably, upon that account, thought it
reasonable, that it should contribute a good deal more towards relieving
 the exigencies of the state. In some countries the lands of the church
are exempted from all taxes. In others they are taxed more lightly than
other lands. In the dutchy of Milan, the lands which the church
possessed before 1575, are rated to the tax at a third only of their
value.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt525" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt525_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">6</a></p>

 Silesia, lands held by a noble tenure are taxed three per cent. higher
than those held by a base tenure. The honours and privileges of
different kinds annexed to the former, his Prussian majesty had probably
 imagined, would sufficiently compensate to the proprietor a small
aggravation of the tax; while at the same time the humiliating
inferiority of the latter would be in some measure alleviated by being
taxed somewhat more lightly. In other countries, the system of taxation,
 instead of alleviating, aggravates this inequality. In the dominions of
 the king of Sardinia, and in those provinces of France which are
subject to what is called the real or predial taille, the tax falls
altogether upon the lands held by a base tenure. Those held by a noble
one are exempted.</p>

 land-tax assessed according to a general survey and valuation, how
equal soever it may be at first, must, in the course of a very moderate
period of time, become unequal. To prevent its becoming so would require
 the continual and painful attention of government to all the variations
 in the state and produce of every different farm in the country. The
governments of Prussia, of Bohemia, of Sardinia, and of the dutchy of
Milan, actually exert an attention of this kind; an attention so
unsuitable to the nature of government, that it is not likely to be of
long continuance, and which, if it is continued, will probably in the
long-run occasion much more trouble and vexation than it can possibly
bring relief to the contributors.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_781"><span class="type-margin"><span>as in Montauban</span></span>In 1666, the generality of Montauban was assessed to the Real or predial taille<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt526" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt526_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> according, it is said, to a very exact survey and valuation.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt527" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt527_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 By 1727, this assessment had become altogether unequal. In order to
remedy this inconveniency, government has found no better expedient than
 to impose upon the whole generality an additional tax of a hundred and
twenty thousand livres. This additional tax is rated upon all the
different districts subject to the taille according to the old
assessment. But it is levied only upon those which in the actual state
of things are by that assessment under-taxed, and it is applied to the
relief of those which by the same assessment are over-taxed. Two
districts, for example, one of which ought in the actual state of things
 to be taxed at nine hundred, the other at eleven hundred livres, are by
 the old assessment both taxed at a thousand livres. Both these
districts are by the additional tax rated at eleven hundred livres each.
 But this additional tax is levied only upon the district under-charged,
 and it is applied altogether to the relief of that over-charged, which
consequently <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>321<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 pays only nine hundred livres. The government neither gains nor loses
by the additional tax, which is applied altogether to remedy the
inequalities arising from the old assessment. The application is pretty
much regulated according to the discretion of the intendant of the
generality, and must, therefore, be in a great measure arbitrary.</p>

 and though they may be originally advanced by the farmer, are finally
paid by the landlord. When a certain portion of the produce is to be
paid away for a tax, the farmer computes, as well as he can, what the
value of this portion is, one year with another, likely to amount to,
and he makes a proportionable abatement in the rent which he agrees to
pay to the landlord. There is no farmer who does not compute beforehand
what the church tythe, which is a land-tax of this kind, is, one year
with another, likely to amount to.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_783">The tythe, and every other land-tax of this kind, under the appearance<span class="type-margin"><span>and are very unequal taxes,</span></span>
 of perfect equality, are very unequal taxes; a certain portion of the
produce being, in different situations, equivalent to a very different
portion of the rent. In some very rich lands the produce is so great,
that the one half of it is fully sufficient to replace to the farmer his
 capital employed in cultivation, together with the ordinary profits of
farming stock in the neighbourhood. The other half, or, what comes to
the same thing, the value of the other half, he could afford to pay as
rent to the landlord, if there was no tythe. But if a tenth of the
produce is taken from him in the way of tythe, he must require an
abatement of the fifth part of his rent, otherwise he cannot get back
his capital with the ordinary profit. In this case the rent of the
landlord, instead of amounting to a half, or five-tenths of the whole
produce, will amount only to four-tenths of it. In poorer lands, on the
contrary, the produce is sometimes so small, and the expence of
cultivation so great, that it requires four-fifths of the whole produce
to replace to the farmer his capital with the ordinary profit. In this
case, though there was no tythe, the rent of the landlord could amount
to no more than one-fifth or two-tenths of the whole produce. But if the
 farmer pays one-tenth of the produce in the way of tythe, he must
require an equal abatement of the rent of the landlord, which will thus
be reduced to one-tenth only of the whole produce. Upon the rent of rich
 lands, the tythe may sometimes be a tax of no more than one-fifth part,
 or four shillings in the pound; whereas upon that of poorer lands, it
may sometimes be a tax of one-half, or of ten shillings in the pound.</p>

<p id="Smith_0206-02_784"><span class="type-margin"><span>which discourage both improvement and good cultivation.</span></span>The
 tythe, as it is frequently a very unequal tax upon the rent, so it is
always a great discouragement both to the improvements of the landlord
and to the cultivation of the farmer. The one cannot venture to make the
 most important, which are generally the most expensive improvements;
nor the other to raise the most valuable, which are generally too the
most expensive crops; when the church, which lays out no part of the
expence, is to share so very largely in the profit. The cultivation of
madder was for a long time confined by the tythe to the United
Provinces, which, being presbyterian countries, and upon that account
exempted from this destructive tax, enjoyed a sort of monopoly of that
useful dying drug against the rest of Europe. The late attempts to
introduce the culture of this plant into England, have been made only in
 consequence of the statute which enacted that five shillings an acre
should be received in lieu of all manner of tythe upon madder.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt528" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt528_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>

 through the greater part of Europe, the church, so in many different
countries of Asia, the state, is principally supported by a land-tax,
proportioned, not to the rent, but to the produce of the land. In China,
 the principal revenue of the sovereign consists in a tenth part of the
produce of all the lands of the empire. This tenth part, however, is
estimated so very moderately, that, in many provinces, it is said not to
 exceed a thirtieth part of the ordinary produce. The land-tax or
land-rent which used to be paid to the Mahometan government of Bengal,
before that country fell into the hands of the English East India
company, is said to have amounted to about a fifth part of the produce.
The land-tax of ancient Egypt is said likewise to have amounted to a
fifth part.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt529" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt529_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>

 The sovereigns of China, those of Bengal while under the Mahometan
government, and those of ancient Egypt, are said accordingly to have
been extremely attentive to the making and maintaining of good roads and
 navigable canals, in order to increase, as much as possible, both the
quantity and value of every part of the produce of the land, by
procuring to every part of it the most extensive market which their own
dominions could afford. The tythe of the church is divided into such
small portions, that no one of its proprietors can have any interest of
this kind. The parson of a parish could never find his account in making
 a road or canal to a distant part of the country, in order to extend
the market for the produce <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>323<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of his own particular parish. Such taxes, when destined for the
maintenance of the state, have some advantages which may serve in some
measure to balance their inconveniency. When destined for the
maintenance of the church, they are attended with nothing but
inconveniency.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_787">Taxes upon the produce of land may be levied, either in kind; or,<span class="type-margin"><span>They may be in kind or in money</span></span> according to a certain valuation, in money.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_788">The parson of a parish, or a gentleman of small fortune who lives<span class="type-margin"><span>Collection in kind is quite unsuitable for public revenue.</span></span>
 upon his estate, may sometimes, perhaps, find some advantage in
receiving, the one his tythe, and the other his rent, in kind. The
quantity to be collected, and the district within which it is to be
collected, are so small, that they both can oversee, with their own
eyes, the collection and disposal of every part of what is due to them. A
 gentleman of great fortune, who lived in the capital, would be in
danger of suffering much by the neglect, and more by the fraud of his
factors and agents, if the rents of an estate in a distant province were
 to be paid to him in this manner. The loss of the sovereign, from the
abuse and depredation of his tax-gatherers, would necessarily be much
greater. The servants of the most careless private person are, perhaps,
more under the eye of their master than those of the most careful
prince; and a public revenue, which was paid in kind, would suffer so
much from the mismanagement of the collectors, that a very small part of
 what was levied upon the people would ever arrive at the treasury of
the prince. Some part of the public revenue of China, however, is said
to be paid in this manner. The Mandarins and other tax-gatherers will,
no doubt, find their advantage in continuing the practice of a payment
which is so much more liable to abuse than any payment in money.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_789">A tax upon the produce of land which is levied in money, may be<span class="type-margin"><span>A money tax on produce may be always the same or may vary with the market price of produce.</span></span>
 levied either according to a valuation which varies with all the
variations of the market price; or according to a fixed valuation, a
bushel of wheat, for example, being always valued at one and the same
money price, whatever may be the state of the market. The produce of a
tax levied in the former way, will vary only according to the variations
 in the real produce of the land according to the improvement or neglect
 of cultivation. The produce of a tax levied in the latter way will
vary, not only according to the variations in the produce of the land,
but according to both those in the value of the precious metals, and
those in the quantity of those metals which is at different times
contained in coin of the same denomination. The produce of the former
will always bear the same proportion to the value of the real produce of
 the land. <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>324<span class="bracket">]</span></span> The produce of the latter may, at different times, bear very different proportions to that value.</p>

 instead either of a certain portion of the produce of land, or of the
price of a certain portion, a certain sum of money is to be paid in full
 compensation for all tax or tythe; the tax becomes, in this case,
exactly of the same nature with the land-tax of England. It neither
rises nor falls with the rent of the land. It neither encourages nor
discourages improvement. The tythe in the greater part of those parishes
 which pay what is called a modus in lieu of all other tythe, is a tax
of this kind. During the Mahometan government of Bengal, instead of the
payment in kind of the fifth<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt531" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt531_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 part of the produce, a modus, and, it is said, a very moderate one, was
 established in the greater part of the districts or zemindaries of the
country. Some of the servants of the East India company, under pretence
of restoring the public revenue to its proper value, have, in some
provinces, exchanged this modus for a payment in kind. Under their
management this change is likely both to discourage cultivation, and to
give new opportunities for abuse in the collection of the public
revenue, which has fallen very much below what it was said to have been,
 when it first fell under the management of the company. The servants of
 the company may, perhaps, have profited by this change, but at the
expence, it is probable, both of their masters and of the country.</p>

<h2 id="lf0206-02_head_032"><span class="ital">Taxes upon the Rent of Houses</span></h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-02_791"><span class="type-margin"><span>House rent consists of two parts,</span></span>THE
 rent of a house may be distinguished into two parts, of which the one
may very properly be called the Building rent; the other is commonly
called the Ground rent.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_792"><span class="type-margin"><span>building rent,</span></span>The
 building rent is the interest or profit of the capital expended in
building the house. In order to put the trade of a builder upon a level
with other trades, it is necessary that this rent should be sufficient,
first, to pay him the same interest which he would have got for his
capital if he had lent it upon good security; and, secondly, to keep the
 house in constant repair, or, what comes to the same thing, to replace,
 within a certain term of years, the capital which had been employed in
building it. The building rent, or the ordinary profit of building, is,
therefore, every where regulated by the ordinary interest of money.
Where the market rate of interest is four per cent. the rent of a house
which, over and above paying the ground rent, affords six, or six and a
half per cent. upon the whole expence of building, may perhaps afford a
sufficient profit to the builder. Where the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>325<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 market rate of interest is five per cent., it may perhaps require seven
 or seven and a half per cent. If, in proportion to the interest of
money, the trade of the builder affords at any time a much greater
profit than this, it will soon draw so much capital from other trades as
 will reduce the profit to its proper level. If it affords at any time
much less than this, other trades will soon draw so much capital from it
 as will again raise that profit.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_793">Whatever part of the whole rent of a house is over and above what<span class="type-margin"><span>and ground rent</span></span>
 is sufficient for affording this reasonable profit, naturally goes to
the ground-rent; and where the owner of the ground and the owner of the
building are two different persons, is, in most cases, completely paid
to the former. This surplus rent is the price which the inhabitant of
the house pays for some real or supposed advantage of the situation. In
country houses, at a distance from any great town, where there is plenty
 of ground to chuse upon, the ground rent is scarce any thing, or no
more than what the ground which the house stands upon would pay if
employed in agriculture. In country villas in the neighbourhood of some
great town, it is sometimes a good deal higher; and the peculiar
conveniency or beauty of situation is there frequently very well paid
for. Ground rents are generally highest in the capital, and in those
particular parts of it where there happens to be the greatest demand for
 houses, whatever be the reason of that demand, whether for trade and
business, for pleasure and society, or for mere vanity and fashion.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_794">A tax upon house-rent, payable by the tenant and proportioned to<span class="type-margin"><span>A tax on house rent paid by the tenant falls partly on the inhabitant and partly on the owner of the ground,</span></span>
 the whole rent of each house, could not, for any considerable time at
least, affect the building rent. If the builder did not get his
reasonable profit, he would be obliged to quit the trade; which, by
raising the demand for building, would in a short time bring back his
profit to its proper level with that of other trades. Neither would such
 a tax fall altogether upon the ground-rent; but it would divide itself
in such a manner as to fall, partly upon the inhabitant of the house,
and partly upon the owner of the ground.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_795">Let us suppose, for example, that a particular person judges that he<span class="type-margin"><span>as may be shown by an example</span></span>
 can afford for house-rent an expence of sixty pounds a year; and let us
 suppose too that a tax of four shillings in the pound, or of one-fifth,
 payable by the inhabitant, is laid upon house-rent. A house of sixty
pounds rent will in this case cost him seventy-two pounds a year, which
is twelve pounds more than he thinks he can afford. He will, therefore,
content himself with a worse house, or a house of fifty pounds rent,
which, with the additional ten pounds that he must pay for the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>326<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 tax, will make up the sum of sixty pounds a year, the expence which he
judges he can afford; and in order to pay the tax he will give up a part
 of the additional conveniency which he might have had from a house of
ten pounds a year more rent. He will give up, I say, a part of this
additional conveniency; for he will seldom be obliged to give up the
whole, but will, in consequence of the tax, get a better house for fifty
 pounds a year, than he could have got if there had been no tax. For as a
 tax of this kind, by taking away this particular competitor, must
diminish the competition for houses of sixty pounds rent, so it must
likewise diminish it for those of fifty pounds rent, and in the same
manner for those of all other rents, except the lowest rent, for which
it would for some time increase the competition. But the rents of every
class of houses for which the competition was diminished, would
necessarily be more or less reduced. As no part of this reduction,
however, could, for any considerable time at least, affect the building
rent; the whole of it must in the long-run necessarily fall upon the
ground-rent. The final payment of this tax, therefore, would fall,
partly upon the inhabitant of the house, who, in order to pay his share,
 would be obliged to give up a part of his conveniency; and partly upon
the owner of the ground, who, in order to pay his share, would be
obliged to give up a part of his revenue. In what proportion this final
payment would be divided between them, it is not perhaps very easy to
ascertain. The division would probably be very different in different
circumstances, and a tax of this kind might, according to those
different circumstances, affect very unequally both the inhabitant of
the house and the owner of the ground.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_796"><span class="type-margin"><span>On the inhabitants it would be an unequal tax, falling heaviest on the rich.</span></span>The
 inequality with which a tax of this kind might fall upon the owners of
different ground-rents, would arise altogether from the accidental
inequality of this division. But the inequality with which it might fall
 upon the inhabitants of different houses would arise, not only from
this, but from another cause. The proportion of the expence of
house-rent to the whole expence of living, is different in the different
 degrees of fortune. It is perhaps highest in the highest degree, and it
 diminishes gradually through the inferior degrees, so as in general to
be lowest in the lowest degree. The necessaries of life occasion the
great expence of the poor. They find it difficult to get food, and the
greater part of their little revenue is spent in getting it. The
luxuries and vanities of life occasion the principal expence of the
rich; and a magnificent house embellishes and sets off to the best
advantage all the other luxuries and vanities which they possess. A tax
upon house-rents, therefore, would in general fall heaviest upon the
rich; and in <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>327<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 this sort of inequality there would not, perhaps, be any thing very
unreasonable. It is not very unreasonable that the rich should
contribute to the public expence, not only in proportion to their
revenue, but something more than in that proportion.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_797">The rent of houses, though it in some respects resembles the rent<span class="type-margin"><span>It
 would be like a tax on any other consumable commodity, it would be very
 much in proportion to men’s whole expense, and it would produce
considerable revenue</span></span> of land, is in one respect
essentially different from it. The rent of land is paid for the use of a
 productive subject. The land which pays it produces it. The rent of
houses is paid for the use of an unproductive subject. Neither the house
 nor the ground which it stands upon produce any thing. The person who
pays the rent, therefore, must draw it from some other source of
revenue, distinct from and independent of this subject.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt532" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt532_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 A tax upon the rent of houses, so far as it falls upon the inhabitants,
 must be drawn from the same source as the rent itself, and must be paid
 from their revenue, whether derived from the wages of labour, the
profits of stock, or the rent of land. So far as it falls upon the
inhabitants, it is one of those taxes which fall, not upon one only, but
 indifferently upon all the three different sources of revenue: and is
in every respect of the same nature as a tax upon any other sort of
consumable commodities. In general there is not, perhaps, any one
article of expence or consumption by which the liberality or narrowness
of a man’s whole expence can be better judged of, than by his
house-rent. A proportional tax upon this particular article of expence
might, perhaps, produce a more considerable revenue than any which has
hitherto been drawn from it in any part of Europe. If the tax indeed was
 very high, the greater part of people would endeavour to evade it, as
much as they could, by contenting themselves with smaller houses, and by
 turning the greater part of their expence into some other channel.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_798">The rent of houses might easily be ascertained with sufficient<span class="type-margin"><span>The
 rent could be easily ascertained Empty houses should be exempt, and

which would be necessary for ascertaining the ordinary rent of land.
Houses not inhabited ought to pay no tax. A tax upon them would fall
altogether upon the proprietor, who would thus be taxed for a subject
which afforded him neither conveniency nor revenue. Houses inhabited by
the proprietor ought to be rated, not according to the expence which
they might have cost in building, but according to the rent which an
equitable arbitration might judge them likely to bring, if leased to a
tenant. If rated according to the expence which they may have cost in
building, a tax of three or four shillings in the pound, joined with
other taxes, would ruin almost all the rich and great families of this, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>328<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 and, I believe, of every other civilized country. Whoever will examine,
 with attention, the different town and country houses of some of the
richest and greatest families in this country, will find that, at the
rate of only six and a half, or seven per cent. upon the original
expence of building, their house-rent is nearly equal to the whole neat
rent of their estates. It is the accumulated expence of several
successive generations, laid out upon objects of great beauty and
magnificence, indeed; but, in proportion to what they cost, of very
small exchangeable value.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt533" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt533_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_799"><span class="type-margin"><span>Ground rent is a still more proper subject of taxation than building rent,</span></span>Ground-rents
 are a still more proper subject of taxation than the rent of houses. A
tax upon ground-rents would not raise the rents of houses. It would fall
 altogether upon the owner of the ground-rent, who acts always as a
monopolist, and exacts the greatest rent which can be got for the use of
 his ground. More or less can be got for it according as the competitors
 happen to be richer or poorer, or can afford to gratify their fancy for
 a particular spot of ground at a greater or smaller expence. In every
country the greatest number of rich competitors is in the capital, and
it is there accordingly that the highest ground-rents are always to be
found. As the wealth of those competitors would in no respect be
increased by a tax upon ground-rents, they would not probably be
disposed to pay more for the use of the ground. Whether the tax was to
be advanced by the inhabitant, or by the owner of the ground, would be
of little importance. The more the inhabitant was obliged to pay for the
 tax, the less he would incline to pay for the ground; so that the final
 payment of the tax would fall altogether upon the owner of the
ground-rent. The ground-rents of uninhabited houses ought to pay no tax.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_800"><span class="type-margin"><span>as no discouragement is given to industry by the taxation of the rent of land</span></span>Both
 ground-rents and the ordinary rent of land are a species of revenue
which the owner, in many cases, enjoys without any care or attention of
his own. Though a part of this revenue should be taken from him in order
 to defray the expences of the state, no discouragement will thereby be
given to any sort of industry. The annual produce of the land and labour
 of the society, the real wealth and revenue of the great body of the
people, might be the same after such a tax as before. Ground-rents, and
the ordinary rent of land, are, therefore, perhaps, the species of
revenue which can best bear to have a peculiar tax imposed upon them.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>329<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_801">Ground-rents seem, in this respect, a more proper subject of peculiar<span class="type-margin"><span>Ground rents are even a more proper subject of taxation than ordinary land rents</span></span>
 taxation than even the ordinary rent of land. The ordinary rent of land
 is, in many cases, owing partly at least to the attention and good
management of the landlord. A very heavy tax might discourage too much
this attention and good management. Ground-rents, so far as they exceed
the ordinary rent of land, are altogether owing to the good government
of the sovereign, which, by protecting the industry either of the whole
people, or of the inhabitants of some particular place, enables them to
pay so much more than its real value for the ground which they build
their houses upon; or to make to its owner so much more than
compensation for the loss which he might sustain by this use of it.
Nothing can be more reasonable than that a fund which owes its existence
 to the good government of the state, should be taxed peculiarly, or
should contribute something more than the greater part of other funds,
towards the support of that government.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_802">Though, in many different countries of Europe, taxes have been<span class="type-margin"><span>Ground rents are nowhere separately taxed, but might be</span></span>
 imposed upon the rent of houses, I do not know of any in which
ground-rents have been considered as a separate subject of taxation. The
 contrivers of taxes have, probably, found some difficulty in
ascertaining what part of the rent ought to be considered as
ground-rent, and what part ought to be considered as building-rent. It
should not, however, seem very difficult to distinguish those two parts
of the rent from one another.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_803">In Great Britain the rent of houses is supposed to be taxed in the<span class="type-margin"><span>House rent is legally liable to the British land tax</span></span>
 same proportion as the rent of land, by what is called the annual
land-tax. The valuation, according to which each different parish and
district is assessed to this tax, is always the same. It was originally
extremely unequal, and it still continues to be so. Through the greater
part of the kingdom this tax falls still more lightly upon the rent of
houses than upon that of land. In some few districts only, which were
originally rated high, and in which the rents of houses have fallen
considerably, the land-tax of three or four shillings in the pound, is
said to amount to an equal proportion of the real rent of houses.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt534" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt534_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Untenanted houses, though by law subject to the tax, are, in most
districts, exempted from it by the favour of the assessors; and this
exemption sometimes occasions some little variation in the rate of
particular houses, though that of the district is always the same.
Improvements of rent, by new buildings, repairs, &amp;c.; go to the
discharge of the district, which occasions still further variations in
the rate of particular houses.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt535" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt535_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>

 every house is taxed at two and a half per cent. of its value, without
any regard either to the rent which it actually pays, or to the
circumstance of its being tenanted or untenanted. There seems to be a
hardship in obliging the proprietor to pay a tax for an untenanted
house, from which he can derive no revenue, especially so very heavy a
tax. In Holland, where the market rate of interest does not exceed three
 per cent. two and a half per cent. upon the whole value of the house,
must, in most cases, amount to more than a third of the building-rent,
perhaps of the whole rent. The valuation, indeed, according to which the
 houses are rated, though very unequal, is said to be always below the
real value. When a house is rebuilt, improved or enlarged, there is a
new valuation, and the tax is rated accordingly.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_805"><span class="type-margin"><span>House taxes in England have not been proportioned to the rent,</span></span>The
 contrivers of the several taxes which in England have, at different
times, been imposed upon houses, seem to have imagined that there was
some great difficulty in ascertaining, with tolerable exactness, what
was the real rent of every house. They have regulated their taxes,
therefore, according to some more obvious circumstance, such as they had
 probably imagined would, in most cases, bear some proportion to the
rent.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_806"><span class="type-margin"><span>but first to the number of hearths,</span></span>The
 first tax of this kind was hearth-money; or a tax of two shillings upon
 every hearth. In order to ascertain how many hearths were in the house,
 it was necessary that the tax-gatherer should enter every room in it.
This odious visit rendered the tax odious. Soon after the revolution,
therefore, it was abolished as a badge of slavery.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_807"><span class="type-margin"><span>and later to the number of windows</span></span>The
 next tax of this kind was, a tax of two shillings upon every dwelling
house inhabited. A house with ten windows to pay four shillings more. A
house with twenty windows and upwards to pay eight shillings. This tax
was afterwards so far altered, that houses with twenty windows, and with
 less than thirty, were ordered to pay ten shillings, and those with
thirty windows and upwards to pay twenty shillings. The number of
windows can, in most cases, be counted from the outside, and, in all
cases, without entering every room in the house. The visit of the
tax-gatherer, therefore, was less offensive in this tax than in the
hearth-money.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_808"><span class="type-margin"><span>The present window tax augments gradually from 2d. per window to 2s.</span></span>This
 tax was afterwards repealed, and in the room of it was established the
window-tax, which has undergone too several alterations and
augmentations. The window-tax, as it stands at present (January, 1775),
over and above the duty of three shillings upon every house in England,
and of one shilling upon every house in Scotland, lays a duty <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>331<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 upon every window, which, in England, augments gradually from
two-pence, the lowest rate, upon houses with not more than seven
windows; to two shillings, the highest rate, upon houses with
twenty-five windows and upwards.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_809">The principal objection to all such taxes is their inequality, an<span class="type-margin"><span>Window taxes are objectionable, chiefly on the ground of inequality</span></span>
 inequality of the worst kind, as they must frequently fall much heavier
 upon the poor than upon the rich. A house of ten pounds rent in a
country town may sometimes have more windows than a house of five
hundred pounds rent in London; and though the inhabitant of the former
is likely to be a much poorer man than that of the latter, yet so far as
 his contribution is regulated by the window-tax, he must contribute
more to the support of the state. Such taxes are, therefore, directly
contrary to the first of the four maxims above mentioned. They do not
seem to offend much against any of the other three.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_810">The natural tendency of the window-tax, and of all other taxes<span class="type-margin"><span>Taxes on houses lower rents.</span></span>
 upon houses, is to lower rents. The more a man pays for the tax, the
less, it is evident, he can afford to pay for the rent. Since the
imposition of the window-tax, however, the rents of houses have upon the
 whole risen, more or less, in almost every town and village of Great
Britain, with which I am acquainted. Such has been almost every where
the increase of the demand for houses, that it has raised the rents more
 than the window-tax could sink them; one of the many proofs of the
great prosperity of the country, and of the increasing revenue of its
inhabitants. Had it not been for the tax, rents would probably have
risen still higher.</p>

<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-02_811">THE revenue or profit arising from stock naturally divides itself into<span class="type-margin"><span>Profit is divided into interest and surplus over interest.</span></span>
 two parts; that which pays the interest, and which belongs to the owner
 of the stock; and that surplus part which is over and above what is
necessary for paying the interest.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_812">This latter part of profit is evidently a subject not taxable directly.<span class="type-margin"><span>The surplus is not taxable</span></span>
 It is the compensation, and in most cases it is no more than a very
moderate compensation, for the risk and trouble of employing the stock.
The employer must have this compensation, otherwise he cannot,
consistently with his own interest, continue the employment. If he was
taxed directly, therefore, in proportion to the whole profit, he would
be obliged either to raise the rate of his profit, or to charge <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>332<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 the tax upon the interest of money; that is, to pay less interest. If
he raised the rate of his profit in proportion to the tax, the whole
tax, though it might be advanced by him, would be finally paid by one or
 other of two different sets of people, according to the different ways
in which he might employ the stock of which he had the management. If he
 employed it as a farming stock in the cultivation of land, he could
raise the rate of his profit only by retaining a greater portion, or,
what comes to the same thing, the price of a greater portion of the
produce of the land; and as this could be done only by a reduction of
rent, the final payment of the tax would fall upon the landlord. If he
employed it as a mercantile or manufacturing stock, he could raise the
rate of his profit only by raising the price of his goods; in which case
 the final payment of the tax would fall altogether upon the consumers
of those goods. If he did not raise the rate of his profit, he would be
obliged to charge the whole tax upon that part of it which was allotted
for the interest of money. He could afford less interest for whatever
stock he borrowed, and the whole weight of the tax would in this case
fall ultimately upon the interest of money. So far as he could not
relieve himself from the tax in the one way, he would be obliged to
relieve himself in the other.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_813"><span class="type-margin"><span>Interest at first sight seems as fit to be taxed as rent,</span></span>The
 interest of money seems at first sight a subject equally capable of
being taxed directly as the rent of land. Like the rent of land, it is a
 neat produce which remains after completely compensating the whole risk
 and trouble of employing the stock. As a tax upon the rent of land
cannot raise rents; because the neat produce which remains after
replacing the stock of the farmer, together with his reasonable profit,
cannot be greater after the tax than before it: so, for the same reason,
 a tax upon the interest of money could not raise the rate of interest;
the quantity of stock or money in the country, like the quantity of
land, being supposed to remain the same after the tax as before it. The
ordinary rate of profit, it has been shewn in the first book,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt537" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt537_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 is every where regulated by the quantity of stock to be employed in
proportion to the quantity of the employment, or of the business which
must be done by it. But the quantity of the employment, or of the
business to be done by stock, could neither be increased nor diminished
by any tax upon the interest of money. If the quantity of the stock to
be employed therefore, was neither increased nor diminished by it, the
ordinary rate of profit would necessarily remain the same. But the
portion of this profit necessary for compensating the risk and trouble
of the employer, would likewise remain the same; <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>333<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 that risk and trouble being in no respect altered. The residue,
therefore, that portion which belongs to the owner of the stock, and
which pays the interest of money, would necessarily remain the same too.
 At first sight, therefore, the interest of money seems to be a subject
as fit to be taxed directly as the rent of land.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_814">There are, however, two different circumstances which render the<span class="type-margin"><span>but it is not, since,</span></span> interest of money a much less proper subject of direct taxation than the rent of land.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_815">First, the quantity and value of the land which any man possesses<span class="type-margin"><span>(1) the amount received by an individual cannot be readily and exactly ascertained,</span></span>
 can never be a secret, and can always be ascertained with great
exactness. But the whole amount of the capital stock which he possesses
is almost always a secret, and can scarce ever be ascertained with
tolerable exactness. It is liable, besides, to almost continual
variations. A year seldom passes away, frequently not a month, sometimes
 scarce a single day, in which it does not rise or fall more or less. An
 inquisition into every man’s private circumstances, and an inquisition
which, in order to accommodate the tax to them, watched over all the
fluctuations of his fortune, would be a source of such continual and
endless vexation as no people could support.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_816">Secondly, land is a subject which cannot be removed, whereas stock<span class="type-margin"><span>and (2) stock may be removed from the country imposing the tax.</span></span>
 easily may. The proprietor of land is necessarily a citizen of the
particular country in which his estate lies. The proprietor of stock is
properly a citizen of the world, and is not necessarily attached to any
particular country. He would be apt to abandon the country in which he
was exposed to a vexatious inquisition, in order to be assessed to a
burdensome tax, and would remove his stock to some other country where
he could either carry on his business, or enjoy his fortune more at his
ease. By removing his stock he would put an end to all the industry
which it had maintained in the country which he left. Stock cultivates
land; stock employs labour. A tax which tended to drive away stock from
any particular country, would so far tend to dry up every source of
revenue, both to the sovereign and to the society. Not only the profits
of stock, but the rent of land and the wages of labour, would
necessarily be more or less diminished by its removal.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_817">The nations, accordingly, who have attempted to tax the revenue<span class="type-margin"><span>Where such a tax exists it is levied on a loose and very low valuation,</span></span>
 arising from stock, instead of any severe inquisition of this kind,
have been obliged to content themselves with some very loose, and,
therefore, more or less arbitrary estimation. The extreme inequality and
 uncertainty of a tax assessed in this manner, can be compensated only
by its extreme moderation, in consequence of which every man finds
himself rated so very much below his real revenue, that he gives himself
 <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>334<span class="bracket">]</span></span> little disturbance though his neighbour should be rated somewhat lower.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_818"><span class="type-margin"><span>as under the English land tax.</span></span>By
 what is called the land-tax in England, it was intended that stock
should be taxed in the same proportion as land. When the tax upon land
was at four shillings in the pound, or at one-fifth of the supposed
rent, it was intended that stock should be taxed at one-fifth of the
supposed interest. When the present annual land-tax was first imposed,
the legal rate of interest was six per cent. Every hundred pounds stock,
 accordingly, was supposed to be taxed at twenty-four shillings, the
fifth part of six pounds. Since the legal rate of interest has been
reduced to five per cent.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt538" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt538_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 every hundred pounds stock is supposed to be taxed at twenty shillings
only. The sum to be raised, by what is called the land-tax, was divided
between the country and the principal towns. The greater part of it was
laid upon the country; and of what was laid upon the towns, the greater
part was assessed upon the houses. What remained to be assessed upon the
 stock or trade of the towns (for the stock upon the land was not meant
to be taxed) was very much below the real value of that stock or trade.
Whatever inequalities, therefore, there might be in the original
assessment, gave little disturbance. Every parish and district still
continues to be rated for its land, its houses, and its stock, according
 to the original assessment; and the almost universal prosperity of the
country, which in most places has raised very much the value of all
these, has rendered those inequalities of still less importance now. The
 rate too upon each district continuing always the same, the uncertainty
 of this tax, so far as it might be assessed upon the stock of any
individual, has been very much diminished, as well as rendered of much
less consequence. If the greater part of the lands of England are not
rated to the land-tax at half their actual value, the greater part of
the stock of England is, perhaps, scarce rated at the fiftieth part of
its actual value. In some towns the whole land-tax is assessed upon
houses; as in Westminster, where stock and trade are free. It is
otherwise in London.</p>

 every inhabitant is obliged to pay to the state, one-fourth per cent.
of all that he possesses; and as the wealth of the people of Hamburgh
consists principally in stock, this tax may be considered as a tax upon
stock. Every man assesses himself, and, in <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>335<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 the presence of the magistrate, puts annually into the public coffer a

to, or being liable to any examination upon that subject.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt540" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt540_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 This tax is generally supposed to be paid with great fidelity. In a
small republic, where the people have entire confidence in their
magistrates, are convinced of the necessity of the tax for the support
of the state, and believe that it will be faithfully applied to that
purpose, such conscientious and voluntary payment may sometimes be
expected. It is not peculiar to the people of Hamburgh.</p>

 is thereby exposed to extraordinary expences. Upon such occasions the
people assemble, and every one is said to declare with the greatest
frankness what he is worth, in order to be taxed accordingly. At Zurich
the law orders, that, in cases of necessity, every one should be taxed
in proportion to his revenue; the amount of which, he is obliged to
declare upon oath. They have no suspicion, it is said, that any of their
 fellow-citizens will deceive them. At Basil the principal revenue of
the state arises from a small custom upon goods exported. All the
citizens make oath that they will pay every three months all the taxes
imposed by the law. All merchants and even all inn-keepers are trusted
with keeping themselves the account of the goods which they sell either
within or without the territory. At the end of every three months they
send this account to the treasurer, with the amount of the tax computed
at the bottom of it. It is not suspected that the revenue suffers by
this confidence.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt543" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt543_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a></p>

engaged in the hazardous projects of trade, all tremble at the thoughts

<p id="Smith_0206-02_823"><span class="type-margin"><span>Holland once adopted the Hamburg practice</span></span>In
 Holland, soon after the exaltation of the late prince of Orange to the
stadtholdership, a tax of two per cent. or the fiftieth penny, as it was
 called, was imposed upon the whole substance of every citizen. Every
citizen assessed himself and paid his tax in the same manner as at
Hamburgh; and it was in general supposed to have been paid with great
fidelity. The people had at that time the greatest affection for their
new government, which they had just established by a general
insurrection. The tax was to be paid but once; in order to relieve the
state in a particular exigency. It was, indeed, too heavy to be
permanent. In a country where the market rate of interest seldom exceeds
 three per cent., a tax of two per cent. amounts to thirteen shillings
and fourpence in the pound upon the highest neat revenue which is
commonly drawn from stock. It is a tax which very few people could pay
without encroaching more or less upon their capitals. In a particular
exigency the people may, from great public zeal, make a great effort,
and give up even a part of their capital, in order to relieve the state.
 But it is impossible that they should continue to do so for any
considerable time; and if they did, the tax would soon ruin them so
completely as to render them altogether incapable of supporting the
state.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_824"><span class="type-margin"><span>On that occasion the tax was meant to be a tax on the capital.</span></span>The
 tax upon stock imposed by the land-tax bill in England, though it is
proportioned to the capital, is not intended to diminish or take away
any part of that capital. It is meant only to be a tax upon the interest
 of money proportioned to that upon the rent of land; so that when the
latter is at four shillings in the pound, the former may be at four
shillings in the pound too. The tax at Hamburgh, and the still more
moderate taxes of Underwald and Zurich, are meant, in the same manner,
to be taxes, not upon the capital, but upon the interest or neat revenue
 of stock. That of Holland was meant to be a tax upon the capital.</p>

 The war having been undertaken, it was said, in defence of the trade of
 the country, the merchants, who were to profit by it, ought to
contribute towards the support of it.</p>

all ordinary cases have their reasonable profit, and, where the
competition is free, can seldom have more than that profit), but always
upon the consumers, who must be obliged to pay in the price of the goods

<p id="Smith_0206-02_828">A tax of this kind when it is proportioned to the trade of the<span class="type-margin"><span>but when not proportioned to the trade of the dealer they oppress the small and favour the great dealer</span></span>
 dealer, is finally paid by the consumer, and occasions no oppression to
 the dealer. When it is not so proportioned, but is the same upon all
dealers, though in this case too it is finally paid by the consumer, yet
 it favours the great, and occasions some oppression to the small
dealer. The tax of five shillings a week upon every hackney coach, and
that of ten shillings a year upon every hackney chair, so far as it is
advanced by the different keepers of such coaches and chairs, is exactly
 enough proportioned to the extent of their respective dealings. It
neither favours the great, nor oppresses the smaller dealer. The tax of
twenty shillings a year for a licence to sell ale; of forty shillings
for a licence to sell spirituous liquors; and of forty shillings more
for a licence to sell wine, being the same upon all retailers, must
necessarily give some advantage to the great, and occasion some
oppression to the small dealers. The former must find it more easy to
get back the tax in the price of their goods than the latter. The
moderation of the tax, however, renders this inequality of less
importance, and it may to many people appear not improper to give some
discouragement to the multiplication of little ale-houses. The tax upon
shops, it was intended, should be the same upon all shops. It could not
well have been otherwise. It would have been impossible to proportion
with tolerable exactness the tax upon a shop to the extent of the trade
carried on in it, without such an inquisition as would have been
altogether insupportable in a free country. If the tax had been
considerable, it would have oppressed the small, and forced almost the
whole retail trade into the hands of the great dealers. The competition
of the former being taken away, the latter would have enjoyed a monopoly
 of the trade; and like all other monopolists would soon have <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>338<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 combined to raise their profits much beyond what was necessary for the
payment of the tax. The final payment, instead of falling upon the
shopkeeper, would have fallen upon the consumer, with a considerable
over-charge to the profit of the shopkeeper. For these reasons, the
project of a tax upon shops was laid aside, and in the room of it was
substituted the subsidy 1759.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_829"><span class="type-margin"><span>The personal taille in France on the profits of agriculture is arbitrary and uncertain.</span></span>What
 in France is called the personal taille is, perhaps, the most important
 tax upon the profits of stock employed in agriculture that is levied in
 any part of Europe.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_830">In the disorderly state of Europe during the
prevalence of the feudal government, the sovereign was obliged to
content himself with taxing those who were too weak to refuse to pay
taxes. The great lords, though willing to assist him upon particular
emergencies, refused to subject themselves to any constant tax, and he
was not strong enough to force them. The occupiers of land all over
Europe were, the greater part of them, originally bond-men. Through the
greater part of Europe they were gradually emancipated. Some of them
acquired the property of landed estates which they held by some base or
ignoble tenure, sometimes under the king, and sometimes under some other
 great lord, like the ancient copy-holders of England. Others, without
acquiring the property, obtained leases for terms of years, of the lands
 which they occupied under their lord, and thus became less dependent
upon him. The great lords seem to have beheld the degree of prosperity
and independency which this inferior order of men had thus come to
enjoy, with a<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt545" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt545_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> malignant and contemptuous indignation, and willingly consented that the sovereign should tax them.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt546" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt546_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 In some countries this tax was confined to the lands which were held in
 property by an ignoble tenure; and, in this case, the taille was said
to be real. The land-tax established by the late king of Sardinia, and
the taille in the provinces of Languedoc, Provence, Dauphiné, and
Brittany; in the generality of Montauban, and in the elections of Agen
and Condom, as well as in some other districts of France, are taxes upon
 lands held in property by an ignoble tenure.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt547" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt547_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 In other countries the tax was laid upon the supposed profits of all
those who held in farm or lease lands belonging to other people,
whatever might be the tenure by which the proprietor held them; and in
this case the taille was said to be personal. In the greater part of
those provinces of France, which are called the Countries of Elections
the taille is of this kind. The real taille, as it is imposed only upon a
 part of the lands of the country, is necessarily an unequal, but it is
not always an <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>339<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 arbitrary tax, though it is so upon some occasions. The personal
taille, as it is intended to be proportioned to the profits of a certain
 class of people, which can only be guessed at, is necessarily both
arbitrary and unequal.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_831">In France the personal taille at present (1775) annually imposed<span class="type-margin"><span>The
 authority which assesses it is always ignorant of the real abilities of
 the contributors and often misled by friendship, party animosity and
private resentment.</span></span> upon the twenty generalities, called the Countries of Elections, amounts to 40,107,239 livres, 16 sous.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt548" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt548_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The proportion in which this sum is assessed upon those different
provinces, varies from year to year, according to the reports which are
made to the king’s council concerning the goodness or badness of the
crops, as well as other circumstances, which may either increase or
diminish their respective abilities to pay. Each generality is divided
into a certain number of elections, and the proportion in which the sum
imposed upon the whole generality is divided among those different
elections, varies likewise from year to year, according to the reports
made to the council concerning their respective abilities. It seems
impossible that the council, with the best intentions, can ever
proportion with tolerable exactness, either of those two assessments to
the real abilities of the province or district upon which they are
respectively laid. Ignorance and misinformation must always, more or
less, mislead the most upright council. The proportion which each parish
 ought to support of what is assessed upon the whole election, and that
which each individual ought to support of what is assessed upon his
particular parish, are both in the same manner varied, from year to
year, according as circumstances are supposed to require. There
circumstances are judged of, in the one case, by the officers of the
election; in the other by those of the parish; and both the one and the
other are, more or less, under the direction and influence of the
intendant. Not only ignorance and misinformation, but friendship, party
animosity, and private resentment, are said frequently to mislead such
assessors. No man subject to such a tax, it is evident, can ever be
certain, before he is assessed, of what he is to pay. He cannot even be
certain after he is assessed. If any person has been taxed who ought to
have been exempted; or if any person has been taxed beyond his
proportion, though both must pay in the mean time, yet if they complain,
 and make good their complaints, the whole parish is reimposed next year
 in order to reimburse them. If any of the contributors become bankrupt
or insolvent, the collector is obliged to advance his tax, and the whole
 parish is reimposed next year in order to reimburse the collector. If
the collector himself should become bankrupt, the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>340<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 parish which elects him must answer for his conduct to the
receiver-general of the election. But, as it might be troublesome for
the receiver to prosecute the whole parish, he takes at his choice five
or six of the richest contributors, and obliges them to make good what
had been lost by the insolvency of the collector. The parish is
afterwards reimposed in order to reimburse those five or six. Such
reimpositions are always over and above the taille of the particular
year in which they are laid on.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_832"><span class="type-margin"><span>Taxes on the profits of agriculture do not, like those on profits of other trades, fall on the consumer, but on the landlord</span></span>When
 a tax is imposed upon the profits of stock in a particular branch of
trade, the traders are all careful to bring no more goods to market than
 what they can sell at a price sufficient to reimburse them for
advancing the tax. Some of them withdraw a part of their stocks from the
 trade, and the market is more sparingly supplied than before. The price
 of the goods rises, and the final payment of the tax falls upon the
consumer. But when a tax is imposed upon the profits of stock employed
in agriculture, it is not the interest of the farmers to withdraw any
part of their stock from that employment. Each farmer occupies a certain
 quantity of land, for which he pays rent. For the proper cultivation of
 this land a certain quantity of stock is necessary; and by withdrawing
any part of this necessary quantity, the farmer is not likely to be more
 able to pay either the rent or the tax. In order to pay the tax, it can
 never be his interest to diminish the quantity of his produce, nor
consequently to supply the market more sparingly than before. The tax,
therefore, will never enable him to raise the price of his produce, so
as to<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt549" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt549_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 reimburse himself by throwing the final payment upon the consumer. The
farmer, however, must have his reasonable profit as well as every other
dealer, otherwise he must give up the trade. After the imposition of a
tax of this kind, he can get this reasonable profit only by paying less
rent to the landlord. The more he is obliged to pay in the way of tax,
the less he can afford to pay in the way of rent. A tax of this kind
imposed during the currency of a lease may, no doubt, distress or ruin
the farmer. Upon the renewal of the lease it must always fall upon the
landlord.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_833"><span class="type-margin"><span>The discouragement to good cultivation caused by the personal taille injures the public, the farmer and the landlord</span></span>In
 the countries where the personal taille takes place, the farmer is
commonly assessed in proportion to the stock which he appears to employ
in cultivation. He is, upon this account, frequently afraid to have a
good team of horses or oxen, but endeavours to cultivate with the
meanest and most wretched instruments of husbandry that he can. Such is
his distrust in the justice of his assessors, that he counterfeits
poverty, and wishes to appear scarce able to pay any thing for fear of
being obliged to pay too much. By this miserable <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>341<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 policy he does not, perhaps, always consult his own interest in the
most effectual manner; and he probably loses more by the diminution of
his produce than he saves by that of his tax. Though, in consequence of
this wretched cultivation the market is, no doubt, somewhat worse
supplied; yet the small rise of price which this may occasion, as it is
not likely even to indemnify the farmer for the diminution of his
produce, it is still less likely to enable him to pay more rent to the
landlord. The public, the farmer, the landlord, all suffer more or less
by this degraded cultivation. That the personal taille tends, in many
different ways, to discourage cultivation, and consequently to dry up
the principal source of the wealth of every great country, I have
already had occasion to observe in the third book of this Inquiry.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt550" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt550_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>

 islands, annual taxes of so much a head upon every negroe, are properly
 taxes upon the profits of a certain species of stock employed in
agriculture. As the planters are, the greater part of them, both farmers
 and landlords, the final payment of the tax falls upon them in their
quality of landlords without any retribution.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_835">Taxes of so much a head upon the bondmen employed in cultivation,<span class="type-margin"><span>Poll taxes have been represented as badges of slavery, but, to the taxpayer every tax is a badge of liberty</span></span>
 seem anciently to have been common all over Europe. There subsists at
present a tax of this kind in the empire of Russia. It is probably upon
this account that poll-taxes of all kinds have often been represented as
 badges of slavery.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt552" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt552_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 Every tax, however, is to the person who pays it a badge, not of
slavery, but of liberty. It denotes that he is subject to government,
indeed, but that, as he has some property, he cannot himself be the
property of a master. A poll-tax upon slaves is altogether different
from a poll-tax upon freemen. The latter is paid by the persons upon
whom it is imposed; the former by a different set of persons. The latter
 is either altogether arbitrary or altogether unequal, and in most cases
 is both the one and the other; the former, though in some respects
unequal, different slaves being of different values, is in no respect
arbitrary. Every master who knows the number of his own slaves, knows
exactly what he has to pay. Those different taxes, however, being called
 by the same name, have been considered as of the same nature.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_836">The taxes which in Holland are imposed upon men and maid<span class="type-margin"><span>Taxes on mental servants are like taxes on consumable commodities</span></span> servants, are taxes, not upon stock, but upon expence; and so far <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>342<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 resemble the taxes upon consumable commodities. The tax of a guinea a
head for every man servant, which has lately been imposed in Great
Britain,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt553" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt553_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 is of the same kind. It falls heaviest upon the middling rank. A man of
 two hundred a year may keep a single man servant. A man of ten thousand
 a year will not keep fifty. It does not affect the poor.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt554" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt554_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_837"><span class="type-margin"><span>Taxes on particular profits cannot affect interest</span></span>Taxes
 upon the profits of stock in particular employments can never affect
the interest of money. Nobody will lend his money for less interest to
those who exercise the taxed, than to those who exercise the untaxed
employments. Taxes upon the revenue arising from stock in all
employments, where the government attempts to levy them with any degree
of exactness, will, in many cases, fall upon the interest of money. The
Vingtieme, or twentieth penny, in France, is a tax of the same kind with
 what is called the land-tax in England, and is assessed, in the same
manner, upon the revenue arising from land, houses, and stock. So far as
 it affects stock it is assessed, though not with great rigour, yet with
 much more exactness than that part of the land-tax of England which is
imposed upon the same fund. It, in many cases, falls altogether upon the
 interest of money. Money is frequently sunk in France upon what are
called Contracts for the constitution of a rent; that is, perpetual
annuities redeemable at any time by the debtor upon repayment of the sum
 originally advanced, but of which this redemption is not exigible by
the creditor except in particular cases. The Vingtieme seems not to have
 raised the rate of those annuities, though it is exactly levied upon
them all.</p>

therefore, may be taxed directly. The transference of stock or moveable
property, from the living to the living, by the lending of money, is
frequently a secret transaction, and may always be made so. It cannot
easily, therefore, be taxed directly. It has been taxed indirectly in
two different ways; first, by requiring that the deed, containing the
obligation to repay, should be written upon paper or parchment which had
 paid a certain stamp-duty, otherwise not to be valid; secondly, by
requiring, under the like penalty of invalidity, that it should be

 descendents, to the twentieth penny only. Direct successions, or those
of descendents to ascendents, pay no tax. The death of a father, to such
 of his children as live in the same house with him, is seldom attended
with any increase, and frequently with a considerable diminution of
revenue; by the loss of his industry, of his office, or of some
life-rent estate, of which he may have been in possession. That tax <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>344<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 would be cruel and oppressive which aggravated their loss by taking
from them any part of his succession. It may, however, sometimes be
otherwise with those children who, in the language of the Roman law, are
 said to be emancipated; in that of the Scotch law, to be
forisfamiliated; that is, who have received their portion, have got
families of their own, and are supported by funds separate and
independent of those of their father. Whatever part of his succession
might come to such children, would be a real addition to their fortune,
and might therefore, perhaps, without more inconveniency than what
attends all duties of this kind, be liable to some tax.</p>

 heir of every immediate vassal of the crown paid a certain duty,
generally a year’s rent, upon receiving the investiture of the estate.
If the heir was a minor, the whole rents of the estate, during the
continuance of the minority, devolved to the superior without any other
charge, besides the maintenance of the minor, and the payment of the
widow’s dower, when there happened to be a dowager upon the land. When
the minor came to be of age, another tax, called Relief, was still due
to the superior, which generally amounted likewise to a year’s rent. A
long minority, which in the present times so frequently disburdens a
great estate of all its incumbrances, and restores the family to their
ancient splendour, could in those times have no such effect. The waste,
and not the disincumbrance of the estate, was the common effect of a

countries, where the greater part of the other feudal customs have gone
into disuse, this tax upon the alienation of land still continues to
make a very<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt558" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt558_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>

<p id="Smith_0206-02_846"><span class="type-margin"><span>In Great Britain the duties are not proportioned to the value of the property.</span></span>In
 Great Britain the stamp-duties are higher or lower, not so much
according to the value of the property transferred (an eighteen penny or
 half crown stamp being sufficient upon a bond for the largest sum of
money) as according to the nature of the deed. The highest do not exceed
 six pounds upon every sheet of paper, or skin of parchment; and these
high duties fall chiefly upon grants from the crown, and upon certain
law proceedings, without any regard to the value of the subject. There
are in Great Britain no duties on the registration of deeds or writings,
 except the fees of the officers who keep the register; and these are
seldom more than a reasonable recompence for their labour. The crown
derives no revenue from them.</p>

 there are both stamp-duties and duties upon registration; which in some
 cases are, and in some are not proportioned to the value of the
property transferred. All testaments must be written upon stamped paper
of which the price is proportioned to the property disposed of, so that
there are stamps which cost from three pence, or three stivers a sheet,
to three hundred florins, equal to about twenty-seven pounds ten
shillings of our money. If the stamp is of an inferior price to what the
 testator ought to have made use of, his succession is confiscated. This
 is over and above all their other taxes on succession. Except bills of
exchange, and some other mercantile bills, all other deeds, bonds, and
contracts, are subject to a stamp-duty. This duty, however, does not
rise in proportion to the value of the subject. All sales of land and of
 houses, and all mortgages upon either, must be registered, and, upon
registration, pay a duty to the state of two and a half per cent. upon
the amount of the price or of the mortgage.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt562" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt562_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 This duty is extended to the sale of all ships and vessels of more than
 two tons burthen, whether decked or undecked. These, it seems, are
considered as a sort of houses upon the water. The sale of moveables,
when it is ordered by a court of justice, is subject to the like duty of
 two and a half per cent.</p>

<p id="Smith_0206-02_849"><span class="type-margin"><span>Both stamps and registration duties are modern methods of taxation.</span></span>Those
 modes of taxation, by stamp-duties and by duties upon registration, are
 of very modern invention. In the course of little more than a century,

duties upon registration extremely common. There is no art which one
government sooner learns of another, than that of draining money from
the pockets of the people.</p>

 upon the transference of property from the dead to the living, fall
finally as well as immediately upon the person to whom the property is
transferred. Taxes upon the sale of land fall altogether upon the
seller. The seller is almost always under the necessity of selling, and
must, therefore, take such a price as he can get. The buyer is scarce
ever under the necessity of buying, and will, therefore, only give<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt563" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt563_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 such a price as he likes. He considers what the land will cost him in
tax and price together. The more he is obliged to pay in the way of tax,
 the less he will be disposed to give in the way of price. Such taxes,
therefore, fall almost always upon a necessitous person,<span class="type-margin"><span>taxes on the sale of new buildings fall on the buyer;</span></span>
 and must, therefore, be frequently very cruel and oppressive. Taxes
upon the sale of new-built houses, where the building is sold without
the ground, fall generally upon the buyer, because the builder must
generally have his profit; otherwise he must give up the trade. If he
advances the tax, therefore, the buyer must generally repay it to him.<span class="type-margin"><span>taxes on the sale of old houses fall on the seller;</span></span>
 Taxes upon the sale of old houses, for the same reason as those upon
the sale of land, fall generally upon the seller; whom in most cases
either conveniency or necessity obliges to sell. The number of new-built
 houses that are annually brought to market, is more or less regulated
by the demand. Unless the demand is such as to afford the builder his
profit, after paying all expences, he will build no more houses. The
number of old houses which happen at any time to come to market is
regulated by accidents of which the greater part have no relation to the
 demand. Two or three great bankruptcies in a mercantile town, will
bring many houses to sale, which must be sold<span class="type-margin"><span>taxes on the sale of ground rents fall on the seller;</span></span>
 for what can be got for them. Taxes upon the sale of ground rents fall
altogether upon the seller; for the same reason as those upon the sale

 and contracts for borrowed money, fall altogether upon the borrower,
and, in fact, are always paid by him. Duties of the same kind upon <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>347<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 law proceedings fall upon the suitors. They reduce to both the capital
value of the subject in dispute. The more it costs to acquire any
property, the less must be the neat<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt564" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt564_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> value of it when acquired.</p>

 they diminish the capital value of that property, tend to diminish the
funds destined for the maintenance of productive labour. They are all
more or less unthrifty taxes that increase the revenue of the sovereign,
 which seldom maintains any but unproductive labourers; at the expence
of the capital of the people, which maintains none but productive.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_852">Such taxes, even when they are proportioned to the value of the<span class="type-margin"><span>Even

the frequency of transference not being always equal in property of
equal value. When they are not proportioned to this value, which is the
case with the greater part of the stamp-duties, and duties of
registration, they are still more so. They are in no respect arbitrary,
but are or may be in all cases perfectly clear and certain. Though they
sometimes fall upon the person who is not very able to pay; the time of
payment is in most cases sufficiently convenient for him. When the
payment becomes due, he must in most cases have the money to pay. They
are levied at very little expence, and in general subject the
contributors to no other inconveniency besides always the unavoidable
one of paying the tax.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_853">In France the stamp-duties are not much complained of. Those of<span class="type-margin"><span>French

 registration, which they call the Contrôle, are. They give occasion, it
 is pretended, to much extortion in the officers of the farmers-general
who collect the tax, which is in a great measure arbitrary and
uncertain. In the greater part of the libels<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt565" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt565_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 which have been written against the present system of finances in
France, the abuses of the Contrôle make a principal article.
Uncertainty, however, does not seem to be necessarily inherent in the
nature of such taxes. If the popular complaints are well founded, the
abuse must arise, not so much from the nature of the tax, as from the
want of precision and distinctness in the words of the edicts or laws
which impose it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_854">The registration of mortgages, and in general of all rights upon<span class="type-margin"><span>Public registration of mortgages and all rights to immovable property is advantageous, but secret registers ought not to exist.</span></span>
 immovable property, as it gives great security both to creditors and
purchasers, is extremely advantageous to the public. That of the greater
 part of deeds of other kinds is frequently inconvenient and even
dangerous to individuals, without any advantage to the public. All
registers which, it is acknowledged, ought to be kept secret, ought <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>348<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 certainly never to exist. The credit of individuals ought certainly
never to depend upon so very slender a security as the probity and
religion of the inferior officers of revenue. But where the fees of
registration have been made a source of revenue to the sovereign,
register offices have commonly been multiplied without end, both for the
 deeds which ought to be registered, and for those which ought not. In
France there are several different sorts of secret registers. This
abuse, though not perhaps a necessary, it must be acknowledged, is a
very natural effect of such taxes.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_855"><span class="type-margin"><span>Many stamp-duties are duties on consumption.</span></span>Such
 stamp-duties as those in England upon cards and dice, upon news-papers
and periodical pamphlets, &amp;c. are properly taxes upon consumption;
the final payment falls upon the persons who use or consume such
commodities. Such stamp-duties as those upon licences to retail ale,
wine, and spirituous liquors, though intended, perhaps, to fall upon the
 profits of the retailers, are likewise finally paid by the consumers of
 those liquors. Such taxes, though called by the same name, and levied
by the same officers and in the same manner with the stamp-duties above
mentioned upon the transference of property, are however of a quite
different nature, and fall upon quite different funds.</p>

<h2 id="lf0206-02_label_637"><span class="csc">Article</span> III: <span class="ital">Taxes upon the Wages of Labour</span></h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-02_856"><span class="type-margin"><span>A tax on wages must raise wages by rather more than the amount of the tax</span></span>THE
 wages of the inferior classes of workmen, I have endeavoured to show in
 the first book, are every where necessarily regulated by two different
circumstances; the demand for labour, and the ordinary or average price
of provisions. The demand for labour, according as it happens to be
either increasing, stationary, or declining; or to require an
increasing, stationary, or declining population, regulates the
subsistence of the labourer, and determines in what degree it shall be,
either liberal, moderate, or scanty. The ordinary or average price of
provisions determines the quantity of money which must be paid to the
workman in order to enable him, one year with another, to purchase this
liberal, moderate, or scanty subsistence. While the demand for labour
and the price of provisions, therefore, remain the same, a direct tax
upon the wages of labour can have no other effect than to raise them
somewhat higher than the tax. Let us suppose, for example, that in a
particular place the demand for labour and the price of provisions were
such, as to render ten shillings a week the ordinary wages of labour;
and that a tax of one-fifth, or four shillings in the pound, was imposed
 <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>349<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 upon wages. If the demand for labour and the price of provisions
remained the same, it would still be necessary that the labourer should
in that place earn such a subsistence as could be bought only for ten
shillings a week, or that after paying the tax he should have ten
shillings a week free wages. But in order to leave him such free wages
after paying such a tax, the price of labour must in that place soon
rise, not to twelve shillings a week only, but to twelve and sixpence;
that is, in order to enable him to pay a tax of one-fifth, his wages
must necessarily soon rise, not one-fifth part only, but one-fourth.
Whatever was the proportion of the tax, the wages of labour must in all
cases rise, not only in that proportion, but in a higher proportion. If
the tax, for example, was one-tenth, the wages of labour must
necessarily soon rise, not one-tenth part only, but one-eighth.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_857">A direct tax upon the wages of labour, therefore, though the labourer<span class="type-margin"><span>The
 rise in the wages of manufacturing labour would be advanced by the
employers and paid by the consumers, and the rise in agricultural wages
advanced by the farmers and paid by the landlords.</span></span> might
perhaps pay it out of his hand, could not properly be said to be even
advanced by him; at least if the demand for labour and the average price
 of provisions remained the same after the tax as before it. In all such
 cases, not only the tax, but something more than the tax, would in
reality be advanced by the person who immediately employed him. The
final payment would in different cases fall upon different persons. The
rise which such a tax might occasion in the wages of manufacturing
labour would be advanced by the master manufacturer, who would both be
entitled and obliged to charge it, with a profit, upon the price of his
goods. The final payment of this rise of wages, therefore, together with
 the additional profit of the master manufacturer, would fall upon the
consumer. The rise which such a tax might occasion in the wages of
country labour would be advanced by the farmer, who, in order to
maintain the same number of labourers as before, would be obliged to
employ a greater capital. In order to get back this greater capital,
together with the ordinary profits of stock, it would be necessary that
he should retain a larger portion, or what comes to the same thing, the
price of a larger portion, of the produce of the land, and consequently
that he should pay less rent to the landlord. The final payment of this
rise of wages, therefore, would in this case fall upon the landlord,
together with the additional profit of the farmer who had advanced it.
In all cases a direct tax upon the wages of labour must, in the
long-run, occasion both a greater reduction in the rent of land, and a
greater rise in the price of manufactured goods, than would have
followed from the proper assessment of a sum equal to the produce of the
 tax, partly upon the rent of land, and partly upon consumable
commodities.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>350<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_858"><span class="type-margin"><span>The effect of the tax in raising wages is generally disguised by the fall in the demand for labour which it occasions</span></span>If
 direct taxes upon the wages of labour have not always occasioned a
proportionable rise in those wages, it is because they have generally
occasioned a considerable fall in the demand for labour. The declension
of industry, the decrease of employment for the poor, the diminution of
the annual produce of the land and labour of the country, have generally
 been the effects of such taxes. In consequence of them, however, the
price of labour must always be higher than it otherwise would have been
in the actual state of the demand: and this enhancement of price,
together with the profit of those who advance it, must always be finally
 paid by the landlords and consumers.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_859"><span class="type-margin"><span>A tax on agricultural wages raises prices no more than one on farmers’ profits. Many countries have such taxes, <span class="ital">e.g.,</span> France and Bohemia.</span></span>A tax upon the wages of country labour does not raise the price of the rude produce of land in proportion to the tax;<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt566" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt566_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> for the same reason that a tax upon the farmer’s profit does not raise that price in that proportion.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt567" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt567_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_860">Absurd and destructive as such taxes are,
however, they take place in many countries. In France that part of the
taille which is charged upon the industry of workmen and day-labourers
in country villages, is properly a tax of this kind. Their wages are
computed according to the common rate of the district in which they
reside, and that they may be as little liable as possible to any
over-charge, their yearly gains are estimated at no more than two
hundred working days in the year.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt568" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt568_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 The tax of each individual is varied from year to year according to
different circumstances, of which the collector or the commissary, whom
the intendant appoints to assist him, are the judges. In Bohemia, in
consequence of the alteration in the system of finances which was begun
in 1748, a very heavy tax is imposed upon the industry of artificers.
They are divided into four classes. The highest class pay a hundred
florins a year; which, at two-and-twenty-pence halfpenny a florin,
amounts to 9 <span class="ital">l.</span> 7 <span class="ital">s.</span> 6 <span class="ital">d.</span>
 The second class are taxed at seventy; the third at fifty; and the
fourth, comprehending artificers in villages, and the lowest class of
those in towns, at twenty-five florins.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt569" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt569_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_861"><span class="type-margin"><span>A tax on the recompense of the liberal professions. etc., would also raise that recompense,</span></span>The recompence of ingenious artists and of men of liberal professions, I have endeavoured to show in the first book,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt570" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt570_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a>
 necessarily keeps a certain proportion to the emoluments of inferior
trades. A tax upon this recompence, therefore, could have no other
effect than to raise it somewhat higher than in proportion to the tax.
If it did not rise in this manner, the ingenious arts and the liberal
professions, being no longer upon a level with other trades, would be so
 much deserted that they would soon return to that level.</p>

 regulated by the free competition of the market, and do not, therefore,
 always bear a just proportion to what the nature of the employment
requires. They are, perhaps, in most countries, higher than it requires;
 the persons who have the administration of government being generally
disposed to reward both themselves and their immediate dependents rather
 more than enough. The emoluments of offices, therefore, can in most
cases very well bear to be taxed. The persons, besides, who enjoy public
 offices, especially the more lucrative, are in all countries the
objects of general envy; and a tax upon their emoluments, even though it
 should be somewhat higher than upon any other sort of revenue, is
always a very popular tax. In England, for example, when by the land-tax
 every other sort of revenue was supposed to be<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt571" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt571_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 assessed at four shillings in the pound, it was very popular to lay a
real tax of five shillings and sixpence in the pound upon the salaries
of offices which exceeded a hundred pounds a year; the pensions of the
younger branches of the royal family, the pay of the officers of the
army and navy, and a few others less obnoxious to envy excepted.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt572" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt572_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> There are in England no other direct taxes upon the wages of labour.</p>

 The state of a man’s fortune varies from day to day, and without an
inquisition more intolerable than any tax, and renewed at least once
every year, can only be guessed at. His assessment, therefore, must in
most cases depend upon the good or bad humour of his assessors, and

tax a considerable degree of inequality may be supported; in a heavy one
 it is altogether intolerable.</p>

 the contributors were, the greater part of them, assessed according to
the degree of their rank; as dukes, marquisses, earls, viscounts,
barons, esquires, gentlemen, the eldest and youngest sons of peers,
&amp;c. All shopkeepers and tradesmen worth more than three hundred
pounds, that is, the better sort of them, were subject to the same
assessment; how great soever might be the difference in their fortunes.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt574" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt574_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 Their rank was more considered than their fortune. Several of those who
 in the first poll-tax were rated according to their supposed fortune,
were afterwards rated according to their rank. Serjeants, attornies, and
 proctors at law, who in the first poll-tax were assessed at three
shillings in the pound of their supposed income, were afterwards
assessed as gentlemen.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt575" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt575_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 In the assessment of a tax which was not very heavy, a considerable
degree of inequality had been found less insupportable than any degree
of uncertainty.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_868"><span class="type-margin"><span>In France the assessment is by rank in the higher and by supposed fortune in the lower orders of people.</span></span>In
 the capitation which has been levied in France without any interruption

people are rated according to their rank, by an invariable <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>353<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 tariff; the lower orders of people, according to what is supposed to be
 their fortune, by an assessment which varies from year to year. The
officers of the king’s court, the judges and other officers in the
superior courts of justice, the officers of the troops, &amp;c. are
assessed in the first manner. The inferior ranks of people in the
provinces are assessed in the second. In France the great easily submit
to a considerable degree of inequality in a tax which, so far as it
affects them, is not a very heavy one; but could not brook the arbitrary
 assessment of an intendant. The inferior ranks of people must, in that
country, suffer patiently the usage which their superiors think proper
to give them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_869">In England the different poll-taxes never produced the sum which<span class="type-margin"><span>The French tax is more rigorously exacted than the English taxes were.</span></span>
 had been expected from them, or which, it was supposed, they might have
 produced, had they been exactly levied. In France the capitation always
 produces the sum expected from it. The mild government of England, when
 it assessed the different ranks of people to the poll-tax, contented
itself with what that assessment happened to produce; and required no
compensation for the loss which the state might sustain either by those
who could not pay, or by those who would not pay (for there were many
such), and who, by the indulgent execution of the law, were not forced
to pay. The more severe government of France assesses upon each
generality a certain sum, which the intendant must find as he can. If
any province complains of being assessed too high, it may, in the
assessment of next year, obtain an abatement proportioned to the
over-charge of the year before. But it must pay in the mean time. The
intendant, in order to be sure of finding the sum assessed upon his
generality, was impowered to assess it in a larger sum, that the failure
 or inability of some of the contributors might be compensated by the
over-charge of the rest; and till 1765, the fixation of this surplus
assessment was left altogether to his discretion. In that year indeed
the council assumed this power to itself. In the capitation of the
provinces, it is observed by the perfectly well-informed author of the
Memoirs upon the impositions in France, the proportion<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt576" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt576_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 which falls upon the nobility, and upon those whose privileges exempt
them from the taille, is the least considerable. The largest falls upon
those subject to the taille, who are assessed to the capitation at so
much a pound of what they pay to that other tax.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt577" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt577_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>

exacted, afford a very sure revenue to the state. It is upon this
account that in countries where the ease, comfort, and security of the
inferior ranks of people are little attended to, capitation taxes are
very common. It is in general, however, but a small part of the public
revenue, which, in a great empire, has ever been drawn from such taxes;
and the greatest sum which they have ever afforded, might always have

<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-02_872"><span class="type-margin"><span>The imposibility of taxation according to revenue has given rise to taxation according to expenditure on consumable commodities.</span></span>THE
 impossibility of taxing the people, in proportion to their revenue, by
any capitation, seems to have given occasion to the invention of taxes
upon consumable commodities. The state not knowing how to tax, directly
and proportionably, the revenue of its subjects, endeavours to tax it
indirectly by taxing their expence, which, it is supposed, will in most
cases be nearly in proportion to their revenue. Their expence is taxed
by taxing the consumable commodities upon which it is laid out.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_873"><span class="type-margin"><span>either necessaries or luxuries.</span></span>Consumable commodities are either necessaries or luxuries.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_874"><span class="type-margin"><span>necessaries including all that creditable people of the lowest order cannot decently go without</span></span>By
 necessaries I understand, not only the commodities which are
indispensably necessary for the support of life, but whatever the custom
 of the country renders it indecent for creditable people, even of the
lowest order, to be without. A linen shirt, for example, is, strictly
speaking, not a necessary of life. The Greeks and Romans lived, I
suppose, very comfortably, though they had no linen.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt578" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt578_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 But in the present times, through the greater part of Europe, a
creditable day-labourer would be ashamed to appear in public without a
linen shirt, the want of which would be supposed to denote that
disgraceful degree of poverty, which, it is presumed, no body can well
fall into without extreme bad conduct. Custom, in the same manner, has
rendered leather shoes a necessary of life in England. The poorest
creditable person of either sex would be ashamed to appear in public
without them. In Scotland, custom has rendered them a necessary of life
to the lowest order of men; but not to the same order of women, who may,
 without any discredit, walk about bare-footed. In France, they are
necessaries neither to men nor to women; the lowest rank of both sexes
appearing there publicly, without any discredit, sometimes in <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>355<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 wooden shoes, and sometimes bare-footed. Under necessaries therefore, I
 comprehend, not only those things which nature, but those things which
the established rules of decency have rendered necessary to the lowest
rank of people. All other things I call luxuries; without meaning by
this appellation, to throw the smallest degree of reproach upon the
temperate use of them. Beer and ale, for example, in Great Britain, and
wine, even in the wine countries, I call luxuries.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt579" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt579_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 A man of any rank may, without any reproach, abstain totally from
tasting such liquors. Nature does not render them necessary for the
support of life; and custom nowhere renders it indecent to live without
them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_875">As the wages of labour are every where regulated, partly by the<span class="type-margin"><span>What raises the price of subsistence must raise wages.</span></span>
 demand for it, and partly by the average price of the necessary
articles of subsistence; whatever raises this average price must
necessarily raise those wages, so that the labourer may still be able to
 purchase that quantity of those necessary articles which the state of
the demand for labour, whether increasing, stationary, or declining,
requires that he should have.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt580" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt580_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 A tax upon those articles necessarily raises their price somewhat
higher than the amount of the tax, because the dealer who advances the
tax, must generally get it back with a profit. Such a tax must,
therefore, occasion a rise in the wages of labour proportionable to this
 rise of price.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_876">It is thus that a tax upon the necessaries of life, operates exactly<span class="type-margin"><span>So that a tax on necessaries, like a tax on wages, raises wages</span></span>
 in the same manner as a direct tax upon the wages of labour. The
labourer, though he may pay it out of his hand, cannot, for any
considerable time at least, be properly said even to advance it. It must
 always in the long-run be advanced to him by his immediate employer in
the advanced rate of his wages. His employer, if he is a manufacturer,
will charge upon the price of his goods this rise of wages, together
with a profit; so that the final payment of the tax, together with this
over-charge, will fall upon the consumer. If his employer is a farmer,
the final payment, together with a like over-charge, will fall upon the
rent of the landlord.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_877">It is otherwise with taxes upon what I call luxuries; even upon those<span class="type-margin"><span>Taxes on luxuries even if consumed by the poor have no such effect,</span></span>
 of the poor. The rise in the price of the taxed commodities, will not
necessarily occasion any rise in the wages of labour. A tax upon
tobacco, for example, though a luxury of the poor as well as of the
rich, will not raise wages. Though it is taxed in England at three
times, and in France at fifteen times its original price, those high
duties seem to have no effect upon the wages of labour. The same <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>356<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 thing may be said of the taxes upon tea and sugar; which in England and
 Holland have become luxuries of the lowest ranks of people; and of
those upon chocolate, which in Spain is said to have become so. The
different taxes which in Great Britain have in the course of the present
 century been imposed upon spirituous liquors, are not supposed to have
had any effect upon the wages of labour. The rise in the price of
porter, occasioned by an additional tax of three shillings upon the
barrel of strong beer,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt581" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt581_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 has not raised the wages of common labour in London. These were about
eighteen pence and twenty-pence a day before the tax, and they are not
more now.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_878"><span class="type-margin"><span>as they act like sumptuary laws, and so do not diminish the ability of the poor to bring up useful families,</span></span>The
 high price of such commodities does not necessarily diminish the
ability of the inferior ranks of people to bring up families. Upon the
sober and industrious poor, taxes upon such commodities act as sumptuary
 laws, and dispose them either to moderate, or to refrain altogether
from the use of superfluities which they can no longer easily afford.
Their ability to bring up families, in consequence of this forced
frugality, instead of being diminished, is frequently, perhaps,
increased by the tax. It is the sober and industrious poor who generally
 bring up the most numerous families, and who principally supply the
demand for useful labour. All the poor indeed are not sober and
industrious, and the dissolute and disorderly might continue to indulge
themselves in the use of such commodities after this rise of price in
the same manner as before; without regarding the distress which this
indulgence might bring upon their families. Such disorderly persons,
however, seldom rear up numerous families; their children generally
perishing from neglect, mismanagement, and the scantiness or
unwholesomeness of their food. If by the strength of their constitution
they survive the hardships to which the bad conduct of their parents
exposes them; yet the example of that bad conduct commonly corrupts
their morals; so that, instead of being useful to society by their
industry, they become public nuisances by their vices and disorders.
Though the advanced price of the luxuries of the poor, therefore, might
increase somewhat the distress of such disorderly families, and thereby
diminish somewhat their ability to bring up children; it would not
probably diminish much the useful population of the country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_879"><span class="type-margin"><span>whereas a rise
 in the price of necessaries diminishes the ability of the poor to bring
 up useful families and supply the demand for labour</span></span>Any
rise in the average price of necessaries, unless it is compensated by a
proportionable rise in the wages of labour, must necessarily diminish
more or less the ability of the poor to bring up numerous families, and
consequently to supply the demand for useful labour; whatever may be the
 state of that demand, whether increasing, stationary, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>357<span class="bracket">]</span></span> or declining; or such as requires an increasing, stationary, or declining population.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_880">Taxes upon luxuries have no tendency to raise the price of any other<span class="type-margin"><span>Taxes on necessaries are contrary to the interest of the middle and superior ranks of people</span></span>
 commodities except that of the commodities taxed. Taxes upon
necessaries, by raising the wages of labour, necessarily tend to raise
the price of all manufactures, and consequently to diminish the extent
of their sale and consumption. Taxes upon luxuries are finally paid by
the consumers of the commodities taxed, without any retribution. They
fall indifferently upon every species of revenue, the wages of labour,
the profits of stock, and the rent of land. Taxes upon necessaries, so
far as they affect the labouring poor, are finally paid, partly by
landlords in the diminished rent of their lands, and partly by rich
consumers, whether landlords or others, in the advanced price of
manufactured goods; and always with a considerable over-charge. The
advanced price of such manufactures as are real necessaries of life, and
 are destined for the consumption of the poor, of coarse woollens, for
example, must be compensated to the poor by a farther advancement of
their wages. The middling and superior ranks of people, if they
understood their own interest, ought always to oppose all taxes upon the
 necessaries of life, as well as all direct taxes upon the wages of
labour. The final payment of both the one and the other falls altogether
 upon themselves, and always with a considerable over-charge. They fall
heaviest upon the landlords, who always pay in a double capacity; in
that of landlords, by the reduction of their rent; and in that of rich
consumers, by the increase of their expence. The observation of Sir
Matthew Decker, that certain taxes are, in the price of certain goods,
sometimes repeated and accumulated four or five times, is perfectly just
 with regard to taxes upon the necessaries of life. In the price of
leather, for example, you must pay, not only for the tax upon the
leather of your own shoes, but for a part of that upon those of the
shoe-maker and the tanner. You must pay too for the tax upon the salt,
upon the soap, and upon the candles which those workmen consume while
employed in your service, and for the tax upon the leather, which the
salt-maker, the soap-maker, and the candle-maker consume while employed
in their service.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt582" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt582_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_881">In Great Britain, the principal taxes upon the necessaries of life are<span class="type-margin"><span>The chief British taxes on necessaries are those on salt, leather, soap and candles,</span></span> those upon the four commodities just now mentioned, salt, leather, soap, and candles.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>358<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_882">Salt is a very ancient and a very universal
subject of taxation. It was taxed among the Romans, and it is so at
present in, I believe, every part of Europe. The quantity annually
consumed by any individual is so small, and may be purchased so
gradually, that nobody, it seems to have been thought, could feel very
sensibly even a pretty heavy tax upon it. It is in England taxed at
three shillings and fourpence a bushel; about three times the original
price of the commodity. In some other countries the tax is still higher.
 Leather is a real necessary of life. The use of linen renders soap
such. In countries where the winter nights are long, candles are a
necessary instrument of trade. Leather and soap are in Great Britain
taxed at three halfpence a pound; candles at a penny;<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt583" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt583_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 taxes which, upon the original price of leather, may amount to about
eight or ten per cent.; upon that of soap to about twenty or five and
twenty per cent.; and upon that of candles to about fourteen or fifteen
per cent.; taxes which, though lighter than that upon salt, are still
very heavy. As all those four commodities are real necessaries of life,
such heavy taxes upon them must increase somewhat the expence of the
sober and industrious poor, and must consequently raise more or less the
 wages of their labour.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_883"><span class="type-margin"><span>and also sea-borne coal</span></span>In
 a country where the winters are so cold as in Great Britain, fuel is,
during that season, in the strictest sense of the word, a necessary of
life, not only for the purpose of dressing victuals, but for the
comfortable subsistence of many different sorts of workmen who work
within doors; and coals are the cheapest of all fuel. The price of fuel
has so important an influence upon that of labour, that all over Great
Britain manufactures have confined themselves principally to the coal
countries; other parts of the country, on account of the high price of
this necessary article, not being able to work so cheap. In some
manufactures, besides, coal is a necessary instrument of trade; as in
those of glass, iron, and all other metals. If a bounty could in any
case be reasonable, it might perhaps be so upon the transportation of
coals from those parts of the country in which they abound, to those in
which they are wanted. But the legislature, instead of a bounty, has
imposed a tax of three shillings and three-pence a ton upon coal carried
 coastways;<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt584" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt584_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 which upon most sorts of coal is more than sixty per cent. of the
original price at the coal-pit. Coals carried either by land or by
inland navigation pay no duty. Where they are naturally cheap, they are
consumed duty free: where they are naturally dear, they are loaded with a
 heavy duty.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>359<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_884">Such taxes, though they raise the price of subsistence, and consequently<span class="type-margin"><span>Such
 taxes at any rate bring in revenue, which is more than can be said of
the regulations of the corn trade, etc., which produce equally bad
effects</span></span> the wages of labour, yet they afford a
considerable revenue to government, which it might not be easy to find
in any other way. There may, therefore, be good reasons for continuing
them. The bounty upon the exportation of corn, so far as it tends in the
 actual state of tillage to raise the price of that necessary article,
produces all the like bad effects; and instead of affording any revenue,
 frequently occasions a very great expence to government. The high
duties upon the importation of foreign corn, which in years of moderate
plenty amount to a prohibition; and the absolute prohibition of the
importation either of live cattle or of salt provisions, which takes
place in the ordinary state of the law, and which, on account of the
scarcity, is at present suspended for a limited time with regard to
Ireland and the British plantations,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt585" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt585_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 have all the bad effects of taxes upon the necessaries of life, and
produce no revenue to government. Nothing seems necessary for the repeal
 of such regulations, but to convince the public of the futility of that
 system in consequence of which they have been established.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_885">Taxes upon the necessaries of life are much higher in many other<span class="type-margin"><span>Much higher taxes on necessaries prevail in many other countries There are taxes on bread,</span></span>
 countries than in Great Britain. Duties upon flour and meal when ground
 at the mill, and upon bread when baked at the oven, take place in many
countries. In Holland the money price of the bread consumed in towns is
supposed to be doubled by means of such taxes. In lieu of a part of
them, the people who live in the country pay every year so much a head,
according to the sort of bread they are supposed to consume. Those who
consume wheaten bread, pay three guilders fifteen stivers; about six
shillings and ninepence halfpenny. These, and some other taxes of the
same kind, by raising the price of labour, are said to have ruined the
greater part of the manufactures of Holland.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt586" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt586_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 Similar taxes, though not quite so heavy, take place in the Milanese,
in the states of Genoa, in the dutchy of Modena, in the dutchies of
Parma, Placentia, and Guastalla, and in the ecclesiastical state. A
French<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt587" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt587_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 author of some note has proposed to reform the finances of his country,
 by substituting in the room of the greater part of other taxes, this
most ruinous of all taxes. There is nothing so <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>360<span class="bracket">]</span></span> absurd, says Cicero, which has not sometimes been asserted by some philosophers.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt588" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt588_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_886"><span class="type-margin"><span>and meat.</span></span>Taxes
 upon butchers meat are still more common than those upon bread. It may
indeed be doubted whether butchers meat is any where a necessary of
life. Grain and other vegetables, with the help of milk, cheese, and
butter, or oil, where butter is not to be had, it is known from
experience, can, without any butchers meat, afford the most plentiful,
the most wholesome, the most nourishing, and the most invigorating diet.
 Decency no where requires that any man should eat butchers meat, as it
in most places requires that he should wear a linen shirt or a pair of
leather shoes.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_887"><span class="type-margin"><span>A tax on a
consumable commodity may be levied either periodically from the consumer
 or once for all from the dealer when the consumer acquires it.</span></span>Consumable
 commodities, whether necessaries or luxuries, may be taxed in two
different ways. The consumer may either pay an annual sum on account of
his using or consuming goods of a certain kind; or the goods may be
taxed while they remain in the hands of the dealer, and before they are
delivered to the consumer. The consumable goods which last a
considerable time before they are consumed altogether, are most properly
 taxed in the one way. Those of which the consumption is either
immediate or more speedy, in the other. The coach-tax and plate-tax are
examples of the former method of imposing: the greater part of the other
 duties of excise and customs, of the latter.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_888"><span class="type-margin"><span>The first method is best when the commodity is durable.</span></span>A
 coach may, with good management, last ten or twelve years. It might be
taxed, once for all, before it comes out of the hands of the
coach-maker. But it is certainly more convenient for the buyer to pay
four pounds a year for the privilege of keeping a coach, than to pay all
 at once forty or forty-eight pounds additional price to the
coach-maker; or a sum equivalent to what the tax is likely to cost him
during the time he uses the same coach. A service of plate, in the same
manner, may last more than a century. It is certainly easier for the
consumer to pay five shillings a year for every hundred ounces of plate,
 near one per cent. of the value, than to redeem this long annuity at
five and twenty or thirty years purchase, which would enhance the price
at least five and twenty or thirty per cent. The different taxes which
affect houses are certainly more conveniently paid by moderate annual
payments, than by a heavy tax of equal value upon the first building or
sale of the house.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_889"><span class="type-margin"><span>Sir M. Decker
proposed to adapt it also to other commodities by issuing annual
licences to consume them, but this would be liable to greater objections
 than the second and usual method</span></span>It was the well-known
proposal of Sir Matthew Decker, that all commodities, even those of
which the consumption is either immediate <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>361<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 or very speedy, should be taxed in this manner; the dealer advancing
nothing, but the consumer paying a certain annual sum for the licence to
 consume certain goods.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt589" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt589_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The object of his scheme was to promote all the different branches of
foreign trade, particularly the carrying trade, by taking away all
duties upon importation and exportation, and thereby enabling the
merchant to employ his whole capital and credit in the purchase of goods
 and the freight of ships, no part of either being diverted towards the
advancing of taxes. The project, however, of taxing, in this manner,
goods of immediate or speedy consumption, seems liable to the four
following very important objections. First, the tax would be more
unequal, or not so well proportioned to the expence and consumption of
the different contributors, as in the way in which it is commonly
imposed. The taxes upon ale, wine, and spirituous liquors, which are
advanced by the dealers, are finally paid by the different consumers
exactly in proportion to their respective consumption. But if the tax
were<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt590" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt590_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 to be paid by purchasing a licence to drink those liquors, the sober
would, in proportion to his consumption, be taxed much more heavily than
 the drunken consumer. A family which exercised great hospitality would
be taxed much more lightly than one who<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt591" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt591_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 entertained fewer guests. Secondly, this mode of taxation, by paying
for an annual, half-yearly, or quarterly licence to consume certain
goods, would diminish very much one of the principal conveniences of
taxes upon goods of speedy consumption; the piece-meal payment. In the
price of three-pence halfpenny, which is at present paid for a pot of
porter, the different taxes upon malt, hops, and beer, together with the
 extraordinary profit which the brewer charges for having advanced them,
 may perhaps amount to about three halfpence. If a workman can
conveniently spare those three halfpence, he buys a pot of porter. If he
 cannot, he contents himself with a pint, and, as a penny saved is a
penny got, he thus gains a farthing by his temperance. He pays the tax
piece-meal, as he can afford to pay it, and when he can afford to pay
it; and every act of payment is perfectly voluntary, and what he can
avoid if he chuses to do so. Thirdly, such taxes would operate less as
sumptuary laws. When the licence was once purchased, whether the
purchaser drunk much or drunk little, his tax would be the same.
Fourthly, if a workman were<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt592" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt592_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 to pay all at once, by yearly, half-yearly or quarterly payments, a tax
 equal to what he at present pays, with little or no inconveniency, upon
 all the different <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>362<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 pots and pints of porter which he drinks in any such period of time,
the sum might frequently distress him very much. This mode of taxation,
therefore, it seems evident, could never, without the most grievous
oppression, produce a revenue nearly equal to what is derived from the
present mode without any oppression. In several countries, however,
commodities of an immediate or very speedy consumption are taxed in this
 manner. In Holland, people pay so much a head for a licence to drink
tea. I have already mentioned a tax upon bread, which, so far as it is
consumed in farm-houses and country villages, is there levied in the
same manner.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_890"><span class="type-margin"><span>Excepting the four mentioned above, British excise duties fall chiefly on luxuries.</span></span>The
 duties of excise are imposed chiefly upon goods of home produce
destined for home consumption. They are imposed only upon a few sorts of
 goods of the most general use. There can never be any doubt either
concerning the goods which are subject to those duties, or concerning
the particular duty which each species of goods is subject to. They fall
 almost altogether upon what I call luxuries, excepting always the four
duties above mentioned, upon salt, soap, leather, candles, and, perhaps,
 that upon green glass.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_891"><span class="type-margin"><span>Customs were originally regarded as taxes on merchants’ profits,</span></span>The
 duties of customs are much more ancient than those of excise. They seem
 to have been called customs, as denoting customary payments which had
been in use from time immemorial. They appear to have been originally
considered as taxes upon the profits of merchants. During the barbarous
times of feudal anarchy, merchants, like all the other inhabitants of
burghs, were considered as little better than emancipated bondmen, whose
 persons were despised, and whose gains were envied. The great nobility,
 who had consented that the king should tallage the profits of their own
 tenants, were not unwilling that he should tallage likewise those of an
 order of men whom it was much less their interest to protect. In those
ignorant times, it was not understood, that the profits of merchants are
 a subject not taxable directly; or that the final payment of all such
taxes must fall, with a considerable over-charge, upon the consumers.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_892"><span class="type-margin"><span>those of aliens being taxed more heavily</span></span>The
 gains of alien merchants were looked upon more unfavourably than those
of English merchants. It was natural, therefore, that those of the
former should be taxed more heavily than those of the latter.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt593" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt593_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 This distinction between the duties upon allens and those upon English
merchants, which was begun from ignorance, has been continued from the
spirit of monopoly, or in order to give our own merchants an advantage
both in the home and in the foreign market.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>363<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_893">With this distinction, the ancient duties of customs were imposed<span class="type-margin"><span>So originally customs were imposed equally on all sorts of goods, and on exports as well as imports.</span></span>
 equally upon all sorts of goods, necessaries as well as luxuries, goods
 exported as well as goods imported. Why should the dealers in one sort
of goods, it seems to have been thought, be more favoured than those in
another? or why should the merchant exporter be more favoured than the
merchant importer?</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_894">The ancient customs were divided into three branches. The first,<span class="type-margin"><span>The
 first was that on wool and leather, and the second tonnage (on wine)
and poundage (on all other goods). Subsidies were additions to poundage</span></span>
 and perhaps the most ancient of all those duties, was that upon wool
and leather. It seems to have been chiefly or altogether an exportation
duty. When the woollen manufacture came to be established in England,
lest the king should lose any part of his customs upon wool by the
exportation of woollen cloths, a like duty was imposed upon them. The
other two branches were, first, a duty upon wine, which, being imposed
at so much a ton, was called a tonnage; and, secondly, a duty upon all
other goods, which, being imposed at so much a pound of their supposed
value, was called a poundage. In the forty-seventh year of Edward III. a
 duty of sixpence in the pound was imposed upon all goods exported and
imported, except wools, wool-fells, leather, and wines, which were
subject to particular duties. In the fourteenth of Richard II. this duty
 was raised to one shilling in the pound; but three years afterwards, it
 was again reduced to sixpence. It was raised to eight-pence in the
second year of Henry IV.; and in the fourth year of the same prince, to
one shilling. From this time to the ninth year of William III. this duty
 continued at one shilling in the pound. The duties of tonnage and
poundage were generally granted to the king by one and the same act of
parliament, and were called the Subsidy of Tonnage and Poundage. The
subsidy of poundage having continued for so long a time at one shilling
in the pound, or at five per cent.; a subsidy came, in the language of
the customs, to denote a general duty of this kind of five per cent.
This subsidy, which is now called the Old Subsidy, still continues to be
 levied according to the book of rates established in the twelfth of
Charles II. The method of ascertaining, by a book of rates, the value of
 goods subject to this duty, is said to be older than the time of James
I.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt594" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt594_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> The new subsidy imposed by the ninth and tenth of William III.,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt595" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt595_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> was an additional five per cent. upon the greater part of goods.

 a fifth upon some particular sorts of goods. Besides those five
subsidies, a great variety of other duties have occasionally been
imposed upon particular sorts of goods, in order sometimes to relieve
the exigencies of the state, and sometimes to regulate the trade of the
country, according to the principles of the mercantile system.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_895"><span class="type-margin"><span>The prevalence of the principles of the mercantile system has led to the removal of nearly all the export duties,</span></span>That
 system has come gradually more and more into fashion. The old subsidy
was imposed indifferently upon exportation as well as importation. The
four subsequent subsidies, as well as the other duties which have since
been occasionally imposed upon particular sorts of goods, have, with a
few exceptions, been laid altogether upon importation. The greater part
of the ancient duties which had been imposed upon the exportation of the
 goods of home produce and manufacture, have either been lightened or
taken away altogether. In most cases they have been taken away. Bounties
 have even been given upon the exportation of some of them. Drawbacks
too, sometimes of the whole, and, in most cases, of a part of the duties
 which are paid upon the importation of foreign goods, have been granted
 upon their exportation. Only half the duties imposed by the old subsidy
 upon importation are drawn back upon exportation: but the whole of
those imposed by the latter<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt599" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt599_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> subsidies and other imposts are, upon the greater part of goods, drawn back in the same manner.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt600" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt600_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 This growing favour of exportation, and discouragement of importation,
have suffered only a few exceptions, which chiefly concern the materials
 of some manufactures. These, our merchants and manufacturers are
willing should come as cheap as possible to themselves, and as dear as
possible to their rivals and competitors in other countries. Foreign
materials are, upon this account, sometimes allowed to be imported duty
free; Spanish wool, for example, flax, and raw linen yarn. The
exportation of the materials of home produce, and of those which are the
 particular<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt601" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt601_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a>
 produce of our colonies, has sometimes been prohibited, and sometimes
subjected to higher duties. The exportation of English wool has been
prohibited.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt602" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt602_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">6</a> That of beaver skins, of beaver wool, and <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>365<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of gum Senega,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt603" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt603_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 has been subjected to higher duties; Great Britain, by the conquest of
Canada and Senegal, having got almost the monopoly of those commodities.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_896">That the mercantile system has not been very favourable to the<span class="type-margin"><span>and has been unfavourable to the revenue of the state</span></span>
 revenue of the great body of the people, to the annual produce of the
land and labour of the country, I have endeavoured to shew in the fourth
 book of this Inquiry. It seems not to have been more favourable to the
revenue of the sovereign; so far at least as that revenue depends upon
the duties of customs.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_897">In consequence of that system, the importation of several sorts of<span class="type-margin"><span>annihilating parts of it by prohibitions of importation,</span></span>
 goods has been prohibited altogether. This prohibition has in some
cases entirely prevented, and in others has very much diminished the
importation of those commodities, by reducing the importers to the
necessity of smuggling. It has entirely prevented the importation of
foreign woollens; and it has very much diminished that of foreign silks
and velvets. In both cases it has entirely annihilated the revenue of
customs which might have been levied upon such importation.</p>

 many different sorts of foreign goods, in order to discourage their
consumption in Great Britain, have in many cases served only to
encourage smuggling; and in all cases have reduced the revenue of the
customs below what more moderate duties would have afforded. The saying
of Dr. Swift, that in the arithmetic of the customs two and two, instead
 of making four, make sometimes only one,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt604" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt604_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 holds perfectly true with regard to such heavy duties, which never
could have been imposed, had not the mercantile system taught us, in
many cases, to employ taxation as an instrument, not of revenue, but of
monopoly.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_899">The bounties which are sometimes given upon the exportation of<span class="type-margin"><span>Bounties
 and drawbacks (great part of which is obtained by fraud) and expenses
of management make a large deduction from the customs revenue</span></span>
 home produce and manufactures, and the drawbacks which are paid upon
the re-exportation of the greater part of foreign goods, have given
occasion to many frauds, and to a species of smuggling more destructive
of the public revenue than any other. In order to obtain the bounty <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>366<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 or drawback, the goods, it is well known, are sometimes shipped and
sent to sea; but soon afterwards clandestinely relanded in some other
part of the country. The defalcation of the revenue of customs
occasioned by bounties and drawbacks, of which a great part are obtained
 fraudulently, is very great. The gross produce of the customs in the
year which ended on the 5th of January 1755, amounted to 5,068,000 <span class="ital">l.</span> The bounties which were paid out of this revenue, though in that year there was no bounty upon corn, amounted to 167,800 <span class="ital">l.</span> The drawbacks which were paid upon debentures and certificates, to 2,156,800 <span class="ital">l.</span> Bounties and drawbacks together, amounted to 2,324,600 <span class="ital">l.</span> In consequence of these deductions the revenue of the customs amounted only to 2,743,400 <span class="ital">l.:</span> from which, deducting 287,900 <span class="ital">l.</span>
 for the expence of management in salaries and other incidents, the neat
 revenue of the customs for that year comes out to be 2,455,500 <span class="ital">l.</span>
 The expence of management amounts in this manner to between five and
six per cent. upon the gross revenue of the customs, and to something
more than ten per cent. upon what remains of that revenue, after
deducting what is paid away in bounties and drawbacks.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_900"><span class="type-margin"><span>In the customs returns the imports are minimised and the exports exaggerated</span></span>Heavy
 duties being imposed upon almost all goods imported, our merchant
importers smuggle as much, and make entry of as little as they can. Our
merchant exporters, on the contrary, make entry of more than they
export; sometimes out of vanity, and to pass for great dealers in goods
which pay no duty; and sometimes to gain a bounty or a drawback. Our
exports, in consequence of these different frauds, appear upon the
customhouse books greatly to overbalance our imports; to the unspeakable
 comfort of those politicians who measure the national prosperity by
what they call the balance of trade.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_901"><span class="type-margin"><span>The customs are very numerous and much less perspicuous and distinct than the excise duties</span></span>All
 goods imported, unless particularly exempted, and such exemptions are
not very numerous, are liable to some duties of customs. If any goods
are imported not mentioned in the book of rates, they are taxed at 4 <span class="ital">s.</span> 99/20 <span class="ital">d.</span> for every twenty shillings value,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt605" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt605_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 according to the oath of the importer, that is, nearly at five
subsidies, or five poundage duties. The book of rates is extremely
comprehensive, and enumerates a great variety of articles, many of them
little used, and therefore not well known. It is upon this account
frequently uncertain under what article a particular sort of goods ought
 to be classed, and consequently what duty they ought to pay. Mistakes
with regard to this sometimes ruin the customhouse officer, and
frequently occasion much trouble, expence, and vexation to the importer.
 In point of perspicuity, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>367<span class="bracket">]</span></span> precision, and distinctness, therefore, the duties of customs are much inferior to those of excise.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_902">In order that the greater part of the members of any society should<span class="type-margin"><span>They might with great advantage be confined to a few articles</span></span>
 contribute to the public revenue in proportion to their respective
expence, it does not seem necessary that every single article of that
expence should be taxed. The revenue, which is levied by the duties of
excise, is supposed to fall as equally upon the contributors as that
which is levied by the duties of customs; and the duties of excise are
imposed upon a few articles only of the most general use and
consumption. It has been the opinion of many people, that, by proper
management, the duties of customs might likewise, without any loss to
the public revenue, and with great advantage to foreign trade, be
confined to a few articles only.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_903">The foreign articles, of the most general use and consumption in<span class="type-margin"><span>Foreign wines and brandies and East and West Indian products at present yield most of the customs revenue</span></span>
 Great Britain, seem at present to consist chiefly in foreign wines and
brandies; in some of the productions of America and the West Indies,
sugar, rum, tobacco, cocoanuts, &amp;c. and in some of those of the East
 Indies, tea, coffee, china-ware, spiceries of all kinds, several sorts
of piece-goods, &amp;c. These different articles afford, perhaps, at
present, the greater part of the revenue which is drawn from the duties
of customs. The taxes which at present subsist upon foreign
manufactures, if you except those upon the few contained in the
foregoing enumeration, have the greater part of them been imposed for
the purpose, not of revenue, but of monopoly, or to give our own
merchants an advantage in the home market. By removing all prohibitions,
 and by subjecting all foreign manufactures to such moderate taxes, as
it was found from experience afforded upon each article the greatest
revenue to the public, our own workmen might still have a considerable
advantage in the home market, and many articles, some of which at
present afford no revenue to government, and others a very
inconsiderable one, might afford a very great one.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_904">High taxes, sometimes by diminishing the consumption of the taxed<span class="type-margin"><span>The yield of high duties is often lessened by smuggling or diminished consumption</span></span>
 commodities, and sometimes by encouraging smuggling, frequently afford a
 smaller revenue to government than what might be drawn from more
moderate taxes.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_905">When the diminution of revenue is the effect of the diminution of<span class="type-margin"><span>In the first case the only remedy is to lower the duty</span></span> consumption, there can be but one remedy, and that is the lowering of the tax.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_906">When the diminution of the revenue is the effect of the encouragement<span class="type-margin"><span>For smuggling the remedy is to lower the tax or increase the difficulty of smuggling.</span></span>
 given to smuggling, it may perhaps be remedied in two ways; either by
diminishing the temptation to smuggle, or by increasing the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>368<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 difficulty of smuggling. The temptation to smuggle can be diminished
only by the lowering of the tax; and the difficulty of smuggling can be
increased only by establishing that system of administration which is
most proper for preventing it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_907"><span class="type-margin"><span>Excise laws are more embarrassing to the smuggler than the customs.</span></span>The
 excise laws, it appears, I believe, from experience, obstruct and
embarrass the operations of the smuggler much more effectually than
those of the customs. By introducing into the customs a system of
administration as similar to that of the excise as the nature of the
different duties will admit, the difficulty of smuggling might be very
much increased. This alteration, it has been supposed by many people,
might very easily be brought about.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_908"><span class="type-margin"><span>If custom were confined to a few articles a system of excise supervision of stores could be instituted.</span></span>The
 importer of commodities liable to any duties of customs, it has been
said, might at his option be allowed either to carry them to his own
private warehouse, or to lodge them in a warehouse provided either at
his own expence or at that of the public, but under the key of the
customhouse officer, and never to be opened but in his presence. If the
merchant carried them to his own private warehouse, the duties to be
immediately paid, and never afterwards to be drawn back; and that
warehouse to be at all times subject to the visit and examination of the
 customhouse officer, in order to ascertain how far the quantity
contained in it corresponded with that for which the duty had been paid.
 If he carried them to the public warehouse, no duty to be paid till
they were taken out for home consumption. If taken out for exportation,
to be duty-free; proper security being always given that they should be
so exported. The dealers in those particular commodities, either by
wholesale or retail, to be at all times subject to the visit and
examination of the customhouse officer; and to be obliged to justify by
proper certificates the payment of the duty upon the whole quantity
contained in their shops or warehouses. What are called the
excise-duties upon rum imported are at present levied in this manner,
and the same system of administration might perhaps be extended to all
duties upon goods imported; provided always that those duties were, like
 the duties of excise, confined to a few sorts of goods of the most
general use and consumption. If they were extended to almost all sorts
of goods, as at present, public warehouses of sufficient extent could
not easily be provided, and goods of a very delicate nature, or of which
 the preservation required much care and attention, could not safely be
trusted by the merchant in any warehouse but his own.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_909"><span class="type-margin"><span>Great simplification without loss of revenue would then be secured,</span></span>If
 by such a system of administration smuggling, to any considerable
extent, could be prevented even under pretty high duties; and if <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>369<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 every duty was occasionally either heightened or lowered according as
it was most likely, either the one way or the other, to afford the
greatest revenue to the state; taxation being always employed as an
instrument of revenue and never of monopoly; it seems not improbable
that a revenue, at least equal to the present neat revenue of the
customs, might be drawn from duties upon the importation of only a few
sorts of goods of the most general use and consumption; and that the
duties of customs might thus be brought to the same degree of
simplicity, certainty, and precision, as those of excise. What the
revenue at present loses, by drawbacks upon the re-exportation of
foreign goods which are afterwards relanded and consumed at home, would
under this system be saved altogether. If to this saving, which would
alone be very considerable, were<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt606" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt606_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 added the abolition of all bounties upon the exportation of
home-produce; in all cases in which those bounties were not in reality
drawbacks of some duties of excise which had before been advanced; it
cannot well be doubted but that the neat revenue of customs might, after
 an alteration of this kind, be fully equal to what it had ever been
before.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_910">If by such a change of system the public revenue suffered no loss,<span class="type-margin"><span>while the trade and manufactures of the country would gain greatly</span></span>
 the trade and manufactures of the country would certainly gain a very
considerable advantage. The trade in the commodities not taxed, by far
the greatest number, would be perfectly free, and might be carried on to
 and from all parts of the world with every possible advantage. Among
those commodities would be comprehended all the necessaries of life, and
 all the materials of manufacture. So far as the free importation of the
 necessaries of life reduced their average money price in the home
market, it would reduce the money price of labour, but without reducing
in any respect its real recompence. The value of money is in proportion
to the quantity of the necessaries of life which it will purchase. That
of the necessaries of life is altogether independent of the quantity of
money which can be had for them. The reduction in the money price of
labour would necessarily be attended with a proportionable one in that
of all home-manufactures, which would thereby gain some advantage in all
 foreign markets. The price of some manufactures would be reduced in a
still greater proportion by the free importation of the raw materials.
If raw silk could be imported from China and Indostan duty-free, the
silk manufacturers in England could greatly undersell those of both
France and Italy. There would be no occasion to prohibit the importation
 of foreign silks and velvets. The cheapness of their goods would secure
 to our own <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>370<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 workmen, not only the possession of the home, but a very great command
of the foreign market. Even the trade in the commodities taxed would be
carried on with much more advantage than at present. If those
commodities were delivered out of the public warehouse for foreign
exportation, being in this case exempted from all taxes, the trade in
them would be perfectly free. The carrying trade in all sorts of goods
would under this system enjoy every possible advantage. If those
commodities were delivered out for home-consumption, the importer not
being obliged to advance the tax till he had an opportunity of selling
his goods, either to some dealer, or to some consumer, he could always
afford to sell them cheaper than if he had been obliged to advance it at
 the moment of importation. Under the same taxes, the foreign trade of
consumption even in the taxed commodities, might in this manner be
carried on with much more advantage than it can at present.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_911"><span class="type-margin"><span>Sir Robert Walpole’s excise scheme was something of this kind so far as wine and tobacco are concerned.</span></span>It
 was the object of the famous excise scheme of Sir Robert Walpole to
establish, with regard to wine and tobacco, a system not very unlike
that which is here proposed. But though the bill which was then brought
into parliament, comprehended those two commodities only; it was
generally supposed to be meant as an introduction to a more extensive
scheme of the same kind. Faction, combined with the interest of
smuggling merchants, raised so violent, though so unjust, a clamour
against that bill, that the minister thought proper to drop it; and from
 a dread of exciting a clamour of the same kind, none of his successors
have dared to resume the project.</p>

 duties upon foreign luxuries imported for home-consumption, though they
 sometimes fall upon the poor, fall principally upon people of middling
or more than middling fortune. Such are, for example, the duties upon
foreign wines, upon coffee, chocolate, tea, sugar, &amp;c.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_913"><span class="type-margin"><span>Those on the luxuries of home produce fall on people of all ranks</span></span>The
 duties upon the cheaper luxuries of home-produce destined for
home-consumption, fall pretty equally upon people of all ranks in
proportion to their respective expence. The poor pay the duties upon
malt, hops, beer, and ale, upon their own consumption: The rich, upon
both<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt607" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt607_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> their own consumption and that of their servants.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_914"><span class="type-margin"><span>Taxes on the consumption of the inferior ranks are much more productive than those on the consumption of the rich.</span></span>The
 whole consumption of the inferior ranks of people, or of those below
the middling rank, it must be observed, is in every country much
greater, not only in quantity, but in value, than that of the middling
and of those above the middling rank. The whole expence of the inferior
is much greater than that of the superior ranks. In the first place,
almost the whole capital of every country is annually distributed among
the inferior ranks of people, as the wages of productive labour.
Secondly, a great part of the revenue arising from both<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt608" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt608_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>371<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the rent of land and<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt609" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt609_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 the profits of stock, is annually distributed among the same rank, in
the wages and maintenance of menial servants, and other unproductive
labourers. Thirdly, some part of the profits of stock belongs to the
same rank, as a revenue arising from the employment of their small
capitals. The amount of the profits annually made by small shopkeepers,
tradesmen, and retailers of all kinds, is every where very considerable,
 and makes a very considerable portion of the annual produce. Fourthly,
and lastly, some part even of the rent of land belongs to the same rank;
 a considerable part to those who are somewhat below the middling rank,
and a small part even to the lowest rank; common labourers sometimes
possessing in property an acre or two of land. Though the expence of
those inferior ranks of people, therefore, taking them individually, is
very small, yet the whole mass of it, taking them collectively, amounts
always to by much the largest portion of the whole expence of the
society; what remains, of the annual produce of the land and labour of
the country for the consumption of the superior ranks, being always much
 less, not only in quantity but in value. The taxes upon expence,
therefore, which fall chiefly upon that of the superior ranks of people,
 upon the smaller portion of the annual produce, are likely to be much
less productive than either those which fall indifferently upon the
expence of all ranks, or even those which fall chiefly upon that of the
inferior ranks; than either those which fall indifferently upon the
whole annual produce, or those which fall chiefly upon the larger
portion of it. The excise upon the materials and manufacture of
home-made fermented and spirituous liquors is accordingly, of all the
different taxes upon expence, by far the most productive; and this
branch of the excise falls very much, perhaps principally, upon the
expence of the common people. In the year which ended on the 5th of July
 1775, the gross produce of this branch of the excise amounted to
3,341,837 <span class="ital">l.</span> 9 <span class="ital">s.</span> 9 <span class="ital">d.</span><a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt610" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt610_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_915">It must always be remembered, however, that it is the luxurious<span class="type-margin"><span>But such taxes must never be on the necessary consumption of the inferior ranks.</span></span>
 and not the necessary expence of the inferior ranks of people that
ought ever to be taxed. The final payment of any tax upon their
necessary expence would fall altogether upon the superior ranks of
people; upon the smaller portion of the annual produce, and not upon the
 greater. Such a tax must in all cases either raise the wages of labour,
 or lessen the demand for it. It could not raise the wages of labour,
without throwing the final payment of the tax upon the superior ranks of
 people. It could not lessen the demand for labour, without lessening
the annual produce of the land and labour of the country, the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>372<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 fund from which all taxes must be finally paid. Whatever might be the
state to which a tax of this kind reduced the demand for labour, it must
 always raise wages higher than they otherwise would be in that state;
and the final payment of this enhancement of wages must in all cases
fall upon the superior ranks of people.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_916"><span class="type-margin"><span>Liquors brewed or distilled for private use are exempt from excise, though a composition must be paid for malting.</span></span>Fermented
 liquors brewed, and spirituous liquors distilled, not for sale, but for
 private use, are not in Great Britain liable to any duties of excise.
This exemption, of which the object is to save private families from<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt611" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt611_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 the odious visit and examination of the tax-gatherer, occasions the
burden of those duties to fall frequently much lighter upon the rich
than upon the poor. It is not, indeed, very common to distil for private
 use, though it is done sometimes. But in the country, many middling and
 almost all rich and great families brew their own beer. Their strong
beer, therefore, costs them eight shillings a barrel less than it costs
the common brewer, who must have his profit upon the tax, as well as
upon all the other expence which he advances. Such families, therefore,
must drink their beer at least nine or ten shillings a barrel cheaper
than any liquor of the same quality can be drunk by the common people,
to whom it is every where more convenient to buy their beer, by little
and little, from the brewery or the alehouse. Malt, in the same manner,
that is made for the use of a private family, is not liable to the visit
 or examination of the tax-gatherer; but in this case the family must
compound at seven shillings and sixpence a head for the tax. Seven
shillings and sixpence are equal to the excise upon ten bushels of malt;
 a quantity fully equal to what all the different members of any sober
family, men, women, and children, are at an average likely to consume.
But in rich and great families, where country hospitality is much
practised, the malt liquors consumed by the members of the family make
but a small part of the consumption of the house. Either on account of
this composition, however, or for other reasons, it is not near so
common to malt as to brew for private use. It is difficult to imagine
any equitable reason why those who either brew or distil for private
use, should not be subject to a composition of the same kind.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_917"><span class="type-margin"><span>It is said

opportunities of defrauding the revenue being much greater in a brewery
than in a malt-house; and those who brew for private use being exempted
from all duties or composition for duties, which is not the case with
those who malt for private use.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_918">In the porter brewery of London, a quarter of
malt is commonly brewed into more than two barrels and a half, sometimes
 into three barrels of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>373<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 porter. The different taxes upon malt amount to six shillings a
quarter; those upon strong beer and ale to eight shillings a barrel. In
the porter brewery, therefore, the different taxes upon malt, beer, and
ale, amount to between twenty-six and thirty shillings upon the produce
of a quarter of malt. In the country brewery for common country sale, a
quarter of malt is seldom brewed into less than two barrels of strong
and one barrel of small beer; frequently into two barrels and a half of
strong beer. The different taxes upon small beer amount to one shilling
and four-pence a barrel. In the country brewery, therefore, the
different taxes upon malt, beer, and ale, seldom amount to less than
twenty-three shillings and four-pence, frequently to twenty-six
shillings, upon the produce of a quarter of malt. Taking the whole
kingdom at an average, therefore, the whole amount of the duties upon
malt, beer, and ale, cannot be estimated at less than twenty-four or
twenty-five shillings upon the produce of a quarter of malt. But by
taking off all the different duties upon beer and ale, and by tripling
the malt-tax, or by raising it from six to eighteen shillings upon the
quarter of malt, a greater revenue, it is said, might be raised by this
single tax than what is at present drawn from all those heavier taxes.</p>

<p id="Smith_0206-02_919"><span class="type-margin"><span>Taxes on cyder
 and mum included in the old malt tax are counterbalanced by the
‘country excise’ duty on cyder, verjuice, vinegar and mead</span></span>Under
 the old malt tax, indeed, is comprehended a tax of four shillings upon
the hogshead of cyder, and another of ten shillings upon the barrel of
mum. In 1774, the tax upon cyder produced only 3083 <span class="ital">l.</span> 6 <span class="ital">s.</span> 8 <span class="ital">d.</span>
 It probably fell somewhat short of its usual amount; all the different
taxes upon cyder having, that year, produced less than ordinary. The tax
 upon mum, though much heavier, is still less productive, on account of
the smaller consumption of that liquor. But to balance whatever may be
the ordinary amount of those two taxes; there is comprehended under what
 is called the country excise, first, the old excise of six shillings
and eight-pence upon the hogshead of cyder; secondly, a like tax of six
shillings and eight-pence upon the hogshead of verjuice; thirdly,
another of eight shillings and nine-pence upon the hogshead of vinegar;
and, lastly, a fourth tax of eleven-pence upon the gallon of mead or
metheglin: the produce of those different taxes will probably much more
than counterbalance that of the duties imposed, by what is called The
annual malt tax upon cyder and mum.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_920"><span class="type-margin"><span>If the malt tax were raised, it would be proper to reduce the excises on wines and spirits containing malt,</span></span>Malt is consumed not only in the brewery of beer and ale, but in the manufacture of low wines and spirits. If the malt tax were<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt612" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt612_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 to be raised to eighteen shillings upon the quarter, it might be
necessary to make some abatement in the different excises which are
imposed upon those particular sorts of low wines and spirits of which
malt makes any part of the materials. In what are called Malt spirits,
it makes commonly but a third part of the materials; the other
two-thirds being either raw barley, or one-third barley and one-third
wheat. In the distillery of malt spirits, both the opportunity and the
temptation to smuggle, are much greater than either in a brewery or in a
 malt-house; the opportunity, on account of the smaller bulk and greater
 value of the commodity; and the temptation, on account of the superior
height of the duties, which amount to 3 <span class="ital">s.</span> 10⅔<span class="ital">d.</span><a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt613" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt613_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 upon the gallon of spirits. By increasing the duties upon malt, and
reducing those upon the distillery, both the opportunities and the
temptation to smuggle would be diminished, which might occasion a still
further augmentation of revenue.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_921"><span class="type-margin"><span>but not so as to reduce the price of spirits</span></span>It
 has for some time past been the policy of Great Britain to discourage
the consumption of spirituous liquors, on account of their supposed
tendency to ruin the health and to corrupt the morals of the common
people. According to this policy, the abatement of the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>375<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 taxes upon the distillery ought not to be so great as to reduce, in any
 respect, the price of those liquors. Spirituous liquors might remain as
 dear as ever; while at the same time the wholesome and invigorating
liquors of beer and ale might be considerably reduced in their price.
The people might thus be in part relieved from one of the burdens of
which they at present complain the most; while at the same time the
revenue might be considerably augmented.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_922">The objections of Dr. Davenant to this alteration in the present<span class="type-margin"><span>Dr Davenant objects that the maltster’s profits would be unfairly taxed, and the rent and profit of barley land reduced,</span></span>
 system of excise duties, seem to be without foundation. Those
objections are, that the tax, instead of dividing itself as at present
pretty equally upon the profit of the maltster, upon that of the brewer,
 and upon that of the retailer, would, so far as it affected profit,
fall altogether upon that of the maltster; that the maltster could not
so easily get back the amount of the tax in the advanced price of his
malt, as the brewer and retailer in the advanced price of their liquor;
and that so heavy a tax upon malt might reduce the rent and profit of
barley land.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt614" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt614_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_923">No tax can ever reduce, for any considerable time, the rate of profit<span class="type-margin"><span>but the change would make malt liquors cheaper, and so be likely to increase the consumption,</span></span>
 in any particular trade, which must always keep its level with other
trades in the neighbourhood. The present duties upon malt, beer, and
ale, do not affect the profits of the dealers in those commodities, who
all get back the tax with an additional profit, in the enhanced price of
 their goods. A tax indeed may render the goods upon which it is imposed
 so dear as to diminish the consumption of them. But the consumption of
malt is in malt liquors; and a tax of eighteen shillings upon the
quarter of malt could not well render those liquors dearer than the
different taxes, amounting to twenty-four or twenty-five shillings, do
at present. Those liquors, on the contrary, would probably become
cheaper, and the consumption of them would be more likely to increase
than to diminish.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>376<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_924"><span class="type-margin"><span>and the
maltster could recover eighteen shillings as easily as the brewer at
present recovers twenty-four or thirty and might be given longer credit</span></span>It
 is not very easy to understand why it should be more difficult for the
maltster to get back eighteen shillings in the advanced price of his
malt, than it is at present for the brewer to get back twenty-four or
twenty-five, sometimes thirty shillings, in that of his liquor. The
maltster, indeed, instead of a tax of six shillings, would be obliged to
 advance one of eighteen shillings upon every quarter of malt. But the
brewer is at present obliged to advance a tax of twenty-four or
twenty-five, sometimes thirty shillings upon every quarter of malt which
 he brews. It could not be more inconvenient for the maltster to advance
 a lighter tax, than it is at present for the brewer to advance a
heavier one. The maltster doth not always keep in his granaries a stock
of malt which it will require a longer time to dispose of, than the
stock of beer and ale which the brewer frequently keeps in his cellars.
The former, therefore, may frequently get the returns of his money as
soon as the latter. But whatever inconveniency might arise to the
maltster from being obliged to advance a heavier tax, it<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt615" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt615_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> could easily be remedied by granting him a few months longer credit than is at present commonly given to the brewer.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_925"><span class="type-margin"><span>The consumption of barley not being reduced, the rent and profit of barley land could not be reduced, as there is no monopoly.</span></span>Nothing
 could reduce the rent and profit of barley land which did not reduce
the demand for barley. But a change of system, which reduced the duties
upon a quarter of malt brewed into beer and ale from twenty-four and
twenty-five shillings to eighteen shillings, would be more likely to
increase than diminish that demand. The rent and profit of barley land,
besides, must always be nearly equal to those of other equally fertile
and equally well cultivated land. If they were less, some part of the
barley land would soon be turned to some other purpose; and if they were
 greater, more land would soon be turned to the raising of barley. When
the ordinary price of any particular produce of land is at what may be
called a monopoly price, a tax upon it necessarily reduces the rent and
profit of the land which grows it. A tax upon the produce of those
precious vineyards, of which the wine falls so much short of the
effectual demand, that its price is always above the natural proportion
to that of the produce of other equally fertile and equally well
cultivated land, would necessarily reduce the rent and profit of those
vineyards. The price of the wines being already the highest that could
be got for the quantity commonly sent to market, it could not be raised
higher without diminishing that quantity; and the quantity could not be
diminished without still greater loss, because the lands could not be
turned to any other <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>377<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 equally valuable produce. The whole weight of the tax, therefore, would
 fall upon the rent and profit; properly upon the rent of the vineyard.
When it has been proposed to lay any new tax upon sugar, our sugar
planters have frequently complained that the whole weight of such taxes
fell, not upon the consumer, but upon the producer; they never having
been able to raise the price of their sugar after the tax, higher than
it was before. The price had, it seems, before the tax been a monopoly
price; and the argument adduced to shew that sugar was an improper
subject of taxation, demonstrated, perhaps, that it was a proper one;
the gains of monopolists, whenever they can be come at, being certainly
of all subjects the most proper. But the ordinary price of barley has
never been a monopoly price; and the rent and profit of barley land have
 never been above their natural proportion to those of other equally
fertile and equally well cultivated land. The different taxes which have
 been imposed upon malt, beer, and ale, have never lowered the price of
barley; have never reduced the rent and profit of barley land. The price
 of malt to the brewer has constantly risen in proportion to the taxes
imposed upon it; and those taxes, together with the different duties
upon beer and ale, have constantly either raised the price, or what
comes to the same thing, reduced the quality of those commodities to the
 consumer. The final payment of those taxes has fallen constantly upon
the consumer, and not upon the producer.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_926">The only people likely to suffer by the change of system here proposed,<span class="type-margin"><span>The only sufferers would be those who brew for private use</span></span>
 are those who brew for their own private use. But the exemption, which
this superior rank of people at present enjoy, from very heavy taxes
which are paid by the poor labourer and artificer, is surely most unjust
 and unequal, and ought to be taken away, even though this change was
never to take place. It has probably been the interest of this superior
order of people, however, which has hitherto prevented a change of
system that could not well fail both to increase the revenue and to
relieve the people.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_927">Besides such duties as those of customs and excise above-mentioned,<span class="type-margin"><span>Tolls on goods carried from place to place affect prices unequally</span></span>
 there are several others which affect the price of goods more unequally
 and more indirectly. Of this kind are the duties which in French are
called Péages, which in old Saxon times were called Duties of Passage,
and which seem to have been originally established for the same purpose
as our turnpike tolls, or the tolls upon our canals and navigable
rivers, for the maintenance of the road or of the navigation. Those
duties, when applied to such purposes, are most properly imposed
according to the bulk or weight of the goods. As they were originally <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>378<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 local and provincial duties, applicable to local and provincial
purposes, the administration of them was in most cases entrusted to the
particular town, parish, or lordship, in which they were levied; such
communities being in some way or other supposed to be accountable for
the application. The sovereign, who is altogether unaccountable, has in
many countries assumed to himself the administration of those duties;
and though he has in most cases enhanced very much the duty, he has in
many entirely neglected the application. If the turnpike tolls of Great
Britain should ever become one of the resources of government, we may
learn, by the example of many other nations, what would probably be the
consequence. Such tolls are no doubt finally paid by the consumer; but
the consumer is not taxed in proportion to his expence when he pays, not
 according to the value, but according to the bulk or weight of what he
consumes. When such duties are imposed, not according to the bulk or
weight, but according to the supposed value of the goods, they become
properly a sort of inland customs or excises, which obstruct very much
the most important of all branches of commerce, the interior commerce of
 the country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_928"><span class="type-margin"><span>Some countries levy transit duties on foreign goods.</span></span>In
 some small states duties similar to those passage duties are imposed
upon goods carried across the territory, either by land or by water,
from one foreign country to another. These are in some countries called
transit-duties. Some of the little Italian states, which are situated
upon the Po, and the rivers which run into it, derive some revenue from
duties of this kind, which are paid altogether by foreigners, and which,
 perhaps, are<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt616" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt616_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 the only duties that one state can impose upon the subjects of another,
 without obstructing in any respect the industry or commerce of its own.
 The most important transit-duty in the world is that levied by the king
 of Denmark upon all merchant ships which pass through the Sound.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_929"><span class="type-margin"><span>Taxes on luxuries do not reach absentees, but the fact that they are paid voluntarily recommend them.</span></span>Such taxes upon luxuries as the greater part of the duties of customs and excise, though they all<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt617" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt617_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 fall indifferently upon every different species of revenue, and are
paid finally, or without any retribution, by whoever consumes the
commodities upon which they are imposed, yet they do not always fall
equally or proportionably upon the revenue of every individual. As every
 man’s humour regulates the degree of his consumption, every man
contributes rather according to his humour than in proportion to his
revenue; the profuse contribute more, the parsimonious less, than their
proper proportion. During the minority of a man of great fortune, he
contributes commonly very little, by his consumption, towards the
support of that state from whose protection <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>379<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 he derives a great revenue. Those who live in another country
contribute nothing, by their consumption, towards the support of the
government of that country, in which is situated the source of their
revenue. If in this latter country there should be no land-tax, nor any
considerable duty upon the transference either of moveable or of
immoveable property, as is the case in Ireland, such absentees may
derive a great revenue from the protection of a government to the
support of which they do not contribute a single shilling. This
inequality is likely to be greatest in a country of which the government
 is in some respects subordinate and dependent upon that of some other.
The people who possess the most extensive property in the dependent,
will in this case generally chuse to live in the governing country.
Ireland is precisely in this situation, and we cannot therefore wonder
that the proposal of a tax upon absentees should be so very popular in
that country. It might, perhaps, be a little difficult to ascertain
either what sort, or what degree of absence would<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt618" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt618_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 subject a man to be taxed as an absentee, or at what precise time the
tax should either begin or end. If you except, however, this very
peculiar situation, any inequality in the contribution of individuals,
which can arise from such taxes, is much more than compensated by the
very circumstance which occasions that inequality; the circumstance that
 every man’s contribution is altogether voluntary; it being altogether
in his power either to consume or not to consume the commodity taxed.
Where such taxes, therefore, are properly assessed and upon proper
commodities, they are paid with less grumbling than any other. When they
 are advanced by the merchant or manufacturer, the consumer, who finally
 pays them, soon comes to confound them with the price of the
commodities, and almost forgets that he pays any tax.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_930">Such taxes are or may be perfectly certain, or may be assessed so as<span class="type-margin"><span>They are also certain</span></span>
 to leave no doubt concerning either what ought to be paid, or when it
ought to be paid; concerning either the quantity or the time of payment.
 Whatever uncertainty there may sometimes be, either in the duties of
customs in Great Britain, or in other duties of the same kind in other
countries, it cannot arise from the nature of those duties, but from the
 inaccurate or unskilful manner in which the law that imposes them is
expressed.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_931">Taxes upon luxuries generally are, and always may be, paid piecemeal,<span class="type-margin"><span>and payable at convenient times,</span></span>
 or in proportion as the contributors have occasion to purchase the
goods upon which they are imposed. In the time and mode of payment they
are, or may be, of all taxes the most convenient. Upon the whole, such
taxes, therefore, are, perhaps, as agreeable to the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>380<span class="bracket">]</span></span> three first of the four general maxims concerning taxation, as any other. They offend in every respect against the fourth.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_932"><span class="type-margin"><span>but take much more from the people than they yield to the state, since</span></span>Such
 taxes, in proportion to what they bring into the public treasury of the
 state, always take out or keep out of the pockets of the people more
than almost any other taxes. They seem to do this in all the four
different ways in which it is possible to do it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_933"><span class="type-margin"><span>(1) the salaries and perquisites of customs and excise officers take a large proportion of what is collected</span></span>First,
 the levying of such taxes, even when imposed in the most judicious
manner, requires a great number of customhouse and excise officers,
whose salaries and perquisites are a real tax upon the people, which
brings nothing into the treasury of the state. This expence, however, it
 must be acknowledged, is more moderate in Great Britain than in most
other countries. In the year which ended on the fifth of July 1775, the
gross produce of the different duties, under the management of the
commissioners of excise in England, amounted to 5,507,308 <span class="ital">l.</span> 18 <span class="ital">s.</span> 8¼ <span class="ital">d.</span><a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt619" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt619_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 which was levied at an expence of little more than five and a half per
cent. From this gross produce, however, there must be deducted what was
paid away in bounties and drawbacks upon the exportation of exciseable
goods, which will reduce the neat produce below five millions.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt620" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt620_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 The levying of the salt duty, an excise duty, but under a different
management, is much more expensive. The neat revenue of the customs does
 not amount to two millions and a half, which is levied at an expence of
 more than ten per cent. in the salaries of officers, and other
incidents. But the perquisites of customhouse officers are every where
much greater than their salaries; at some ports more than double or
triple those salaries. If the salaries of officers, and other incidents,
 therefore, amount to more than ten per cent. upon the neat revenue of
the customs; the whole expence of levying that revenue may amount, in
salaries and perquisites together, to more than twenty or thirty per
cent. The officers of excise receive few or no perquisites: and the
administration of that branch of the revenue being of more recent
establishment, is in general less corrupted than that of the customs,
into which length of time has introduced and authorised many abuses. By
charging upon malt the whole revenue which is at present levied by the
different duties upon malt and malt liquors, a saving, it is supposed,
of more than fifty thousand pounds might be made in the annual expence
of the excise. By confining the duties of customs to a few sorts of
goods, and by levying those duties according to the excise laws, a much <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>381<span class="bracket">]</span></span> greater saving might probably be made in the annual expence of the customs.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_934">Secondly, such taxes necessarily occasion some obstruction or discouragement<span class="type-margin"><span>(2) particular branches of industry are discouraged</span></span>
 to certain branches of industry. As they always raise the price of the
commodity taxed, they so far discourage its consumption, and
consequently its production. If it is a commodity of home growth or
manufacture, less labour comes to be employed in raising and producing
it. If it is a foreign commodity of which the tax increases in this
manner the price, the commodities of the same kind which are made at
home may thereby, indeed, gain some advantage in the home market, and a
greater quantity of domestic industry may thereby be turned toward
preparing them. But though this rise of price in a foreign commodity may
 encourage domestic industry in one particular branch, it necessarily
discourages that industry in almost every other. The dearer the
Birmingham manufacturer buys his foreign wine, the cheaper he
necessarily sells that part of his hardware with which, or, what comes
to the same thing, with the price of which he buys it. That part of his
hardware, therefore, becomes of less value to him, and he has less
encouragement to work at it. The dearer the consumers in one country pay
 for the surplus produce of another, the cheaper they necessarily sell
that part of their own surplus produce with which, or, what comes to the
 same thing, with the price of which they buy it. That part of their own
 surplus produce becomes of less value to them, and they have less
encouragement to increase its quantity. All taxes upon consumable
commodities, therefore, tend to reduce the quantity of productive labour
 below what it otherwise would be, either in preparing the commodities
taxed, if they are home commodities; or in preparing those with which
they are purchased, if they are foreign commodities. Such taxes too
always alter, more or less, the natural direction of national industry,
and turn it into a channel always different from, and generally less
advantageous than that in which it would have run of its own accord.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_935">Thirdly, the hope of evading such taxes by smuggling gives frequent<span class="type-margin"><span>(3) smuggling is encouraged</span></span>
 occasion to forfeitures and other penalties, which entirely ruin the
smuggler; a person who, though no doubt highly blameable for violating
the laws of his country, is frequently incapable of violating those of
natural justice, and would have been, in every respect, an excellent
citizen, had not the laws of his country made that a crime which nature
never meant to be so. In those corrupted governments where there is at
least a general suspicion of much unnecessary expence, and great
misapplication of the public revenue, the laws which <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>382<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 guard it are little respected. Not many people are scrupulous about
smuggling, when, without perjury, they can find any easy and safe
opportunity of doing so. To pretend to have any scruple about buying
smuggled goods, though a manifest encouragement to the violation of the
revenue laws, and to the perjury which almost always attends it, would
in most countries be regarded as one of those pedantic pieces of
hypocrisy which, instead of gaining credit with any body, serve only to
expose the person who affects to practise them, to the suspicion of
being a greater knave than most of his neighbours. By this indulgence of
 the public, the smuggler is often encouraged to continue a trade which
he is thus taught to consider as in some measure innocent; and when the
severity of the revenue laws is ready to fall upon him, he is frequently
 disposed to defend with violence, what he has been accustomed to regard
 as his just property. From being at first, perhaps, rather imprudent
than criminal, he at last too often becomes one of the hardiest and most
 determined violators of the laws of society. By the ruin of the
smuggler, his capital, which had before been employed in maintaining
productive labour, is absorbed either in the revenue of the state or in
that of the revenue-officer, and is employed in maintaining
unproductive, to the diminution of the general capital of the society,
and of the useful industry which it might otherwise have maintained.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_936"><span class="type-margin"><span>and (4) vexation equivalent to expense is caused by the tax-gatherers’ examinations and visits.</span></span>Fourthly,
 such taxes, by subjecting at least the dealers in the taxed commodities
 to the frequent visits and odious examination of the tax-gatherers,
expose them sometimes, no doubt, to some degree of oppression, and
always to much trouble and vexation; and though vexation, as has already
 been said,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt621" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt621_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 is not strictly speaking expence, it is certainly equivalent to the
expence at which every man would be willing to redeem himself from it.
The laws of excise, though more effectual for the purpose for which they
 were instituted, are, in this respect, more vexatious than those of the
 customs. When a merchant has imported goods subject to certain duties
of customs, when he has paid those duties, and lodged the goods in his
warehouse, he is not in most cases liable to any further trouble or
vexation from the customhouse officer. It is otherwise with goods
subject to duties of excise. The dealers have no respite from the
continual visits and examination of the excise officers. The duties of
excise are, upon this account, more unpopular than those of the customs;
 and so are the officers who levy them. Those officers, it is pretended,
 though in general, perhaps, they do their duty fully as well as those
of the customs; yet, as that duty obliges them to be frequently very
troublesome to some of their <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>383<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 neighbours, commonly contract a certain hardness of character which the
 others frequently have not. This observation, however, may very
probably be the mere suggestion of fraudulent dealers, whose smuggling
is either prevented or detected by their diligence.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_937">The inconveniencies, however, which are, perhaps, in some degree<span class="type-margin"><span>Great Britain suffers less than other countries from these inconveniencies</span></span>
 inseparable from taxes upon consumable commodities, fall as light upon
the people of Great Britain as upon those of any other country of which
the government is nearly as expensive. Our state is not perfect, and
might be mended; but it is as good or better than that of most of our
neighbours.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_938">In consequence of the notion that duties upon consumable goods<span class="type-margin"><span>Duties on commodities are sometimes repeated on each sale, as by the Spanish Alcavala,</span></span>
 were taxes upon the profits of merchants, those duties have, in some
countries, been repeated upon every successive sale of the goods. If the
 profits of the merchant importer or merchant manufacturer were taxed,
equality seemed to require that those of all the middle buyers, who
intervened between either of them and the consumer, should likewise be
taxed. The famous Alcavala of Spain seems to have been established upon
this principle. It was at first a tax of ten per cent., afterwards of
fourteen per cent., and is at present of only six per cent. upon the
sale of every sort of property, whether moveable or immoveable; and it
is repeated every time the property is sold.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt622" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt622_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The levying of this tax requires a multitude of revenue-officers
sufficient to guard the transportation of goods, not only from one
province to another, but from one shop to another. It subjects, not only
 the dealers in some sorts of goods, but those in all sorts, every
farmer, every manufacturer, every merchant and shop-keeper, to the
continual visits and examination of the tax-gatherers. Through the
greater part of a country in which a tax of this kind is established,
nothing can be produced for distant sale. The produce of every part of
the country must be proportioned to the consumption of the
neighbourhood. It is to the Alcavala, accordingly, that Ustaritz imputes
 the ruin of the manufactures of Spain.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt623" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt623_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> He might have imputed to it likewise the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>384<span class="bracket">]</span></span> declension of agriculture, it being imposed not only upon manufactures, but upon the rude produce of the land.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_939"><span class="type-margin"><span>and the 3 per cent. tax at Naples</span></span>In
 the kingdom of Naples there is a similar tax of three per cent. upon
the value of all contracts, and consequently upon that of all contracts
of sale. It is both lighter than the Spanish tax, and the greater part
of towns and parishes are allowed to pay a composition in lieu of it.
They levy this composition in what manner they please, generally in a
way that gives no interruption to the interior commerce of the place.
The Neapolitan tax, therefore, is not near so ruinous as the Spanish
one.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_940"><span class="type-margin"><span>Great advantage is obtained by the uniformity of taxation in Great Britain</span></span>The
 uniform system of taxation, which, with a few exceptions of no great
consequence, takes place in all the different parts of the united
kingdom of Great Britain, leaves the interior commerce of the country,
the inland and coasting trade, almost entirely free. The inland trade is
 almost perfectly free, and the greater part of goods may be carried
from one end of the kingdom to the other, without requiring any permit
or let-pass, without being subject to question, visit, or examination
from the revenue officers. There are a few exceptions, but they are such
 as can give no interruption to any important branch of the inland
commerce of the country. Goods carried coastwise, indeed, require
certificates or coast cockets. If you except coals, however, the rest
are almost all duty-free. This freedom of interior commerce, the effect
of the uniformity of the system of taxation, is perhaps one of the
principal causes of the prosperity of Great Britain; every great country
 being necessarily the best and most extensive market for the greater
part of the productions of its own industry. If the same freedom, in
consequence of the same uniformity, could be extended to Ireland and the
 plantations, both the grandeur of the state and the prosperity of every
 part of the empire, would probably be still greater than at present.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_941"><span class="type-margin"><span>In France the diversity of taxes in different provinces occasions many hindrances to internal trade.</span></span>In
 France, the different revenue laws which take place in the different
provinces, require a multitude of revenue-officers to surround, not only
 the frontiers of the kingdom, but those of almost each particular
province, in order either to prevent the importation of certain goods,
or to subject it to the payment of certain duties, to the no small
interruption of the interior commerce of the country. Some provinces are
 allowed to compound for the gabelle or salt-tax. Others are exempted
from it altogether. Some provinces are exempted from the exclusive sale
of tobacco, which the farmers-general enjoy through the greater part of
the kingdom. The aids, which correspond to the excise in England, are
very different in different provinces. Some <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>385<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 provinces are exempted from them, and pay a composition or equivalent.
In those in which they take place and are in farm, there are many local
duties which do not extend beyond a particular town or district. The
Traites, which correspond to our customs, divide the kingdom into three
great parts; first, the provinces subject to the tarif of 1664, which
are called the provinces of the five great farms, and under which are
comprehended Picardy, Normandy, and the greater part of the interior
provinces of the kingdom; secondly, the provinces subject to the tarif
of 1667, which are called the provinces reckoned foreign, and under
which are comprehended the greater part of the frontier provinces; and,
thirdly, those provinces which are said to be treated as foreign, or
which, because they are allowed a free commerce with foreign countries,
are in their commerce with the other provinces of France subjected to
the same duties as other foreign countries. These are Alsace, the three
bishopricks of Metz, Toul, and Verdun, and the three cities of Dunkirk,
Bayonne, and Marseilles. Both in the provinces of the five great farms
(called so on account of an ancient division of the duties of customs
into five great branches, each of which was originally the subject of a
particular farm, though they are now all united into one), and in those
which are said to be reckoned foreign, there are many local duties which
 do not extend beyond a particular town or district. There are some such
 even in the provinces which are said to be treated as foreign,
particularly in the city of Marseilles. It is unnecessary to observe how
 much, both the restraints upon the interior commerce of the country,
and the number of the revenue officers must be multiplied, in order to
guard the frontiers of those different provinces and districts, which
are subject to such different systems of taxation.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_942">Over and above the general restraints arising from this complicated<span class="type-margin"><span>and the commerce in wine is subject to particular restraints</span></span>
 system of revenue laws, the commerce of wine, after corn perhaps the
most important production of France, is in the greater part of the
provinces subject to particular restraints, arising from the favour
which has been shewn to the vineyards of particular provinces and
districts, above those of others. The provinces most famous for their
wines, it will be found, I believe, are those in which the trade in that
 article is subject to the fewest restraints of this kind. The extensive
 market which such provinces enjoy, encourages good management both in
the cultivation of their vineyards, and in the subsequent preparation of
 their wines.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_943">Such various and complicated revenue laws are not peculiar to<span class="type-margin"><span>Milan and Parma are still more absurdly managed</span></span> France. The little dutchy of Milan is divided into six provinces, in <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>386<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 each of which there is a different system of taxation with regard to
several different sorts of consumable goods. The still smaller
territories of the duke of Parma are divided into three or four, each of
 which has, in the same manner, a system of its own. Under such absurd
management, nothing, but the great fertility of the soil and happiness
of the climate, could preserve such countries from soon relapsing into
the lowest state of poverty and barbarism.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_944"><span class="type-margin"><span>The collection of taxes by government officers is much superior to letting the taxes to farm</span></span>Taxes
 upon consumable commodities may either be levied by an administration
of which the officers are appointed by government and are immediately
accountable to government, of which the revenue must in this case vary
from year to year, according to the occasional variations in the produce
 of the tax; or they may be let in farm for a rent certain, the farmer
being allowed to appoint his own officers, who, though obliged to levy
the tax in the manner directed by the law, are under his immediate
inspection, and are immediately accountable to him. The best and most
frugal way of levying a tax can never be by farm. Over and above what is
 necessary for paying the stipulated rent, the salaries of the officers,
 and the whole expence of administration, the farmer must always draw
from the produce of the tax a certain profit proportioned at least to
the advance which he makes, to the risk which he runs, to the trouble
which he is at, and to the knowledge and skill which it requires to
manage so very complicated a concern. Government, by establishing an
administration under their own immediate inspection, of the same kind
with that which the farmer establishes, might at least save this profit,
 which is almost always exorbitant. To farm any considerable branch of
the public revenue, requires either a great capital or a great credit;
circumstances which would alone restrain the competition for such an
undertaking to a very small number of people. Of the few who have this
capital or credit, a still smaller number have the necessary knowledge
or experience; another circumstance which restrains the competition
still further. The very few, who are in condition to become competitors,
 find it more for their interest to combine together; to become
copartners instead of competitors, and when the farm is set up to
auction, to offer no rent, but what is much below the real value. In
countries where the public revenues are in farm, the farmers are
generally the most opulent people. Their wealth would alone excite the
public indignation, and the vanity which almost always accompanies such
upstart fortunes, the foolish ostentation with which they commonly
display that wealth, excites that indignation still more.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>387<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_945">The farmers of the public revenue never find the laws too severe,<span class="type-margin"><span>Farmers of taxes require sanguinary revenue laws.</span></span>
 which punish any attempt to evade the payment of a tax. They have no
bowels for the contributors, who are not their subjects, and whose
universal bankruptcy, if it should happen the day after their farm is
expired, would not much affect their interest. In the greatest
exigencies of the state, when the anxiety of the sovereign for the exact
 payment of his revenue is necessarily the greatest, they seldom fail to
 complain that without laws more rigorous than those which actually take
 place, it will be impossible for them to pay even the usual rent. In
those moments of public distress their demands cannot be disputed. The
revenue laws, therefore, become gradually more and more severe. The most
 sanguinary are always to be found in countries where the greater part
of the public revenue is in farm. The mildest, in countries where it is
levied under the immediate inspection of the sovereign. Even a bad
sovereign feels more compassion for his people than can ever be expected
 from the farmers of his revenue. He knows that the permanent grandeur
of his family depends upon the prosperity of his people, and he will
never knowingly ruin that prosperity for the sake of any momentary
interest of his own. It is otherwise with the farmers of his revenue,
whose grandeur may frequently be the effect of the ruin, and not of the
prosperity of his people.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_946">A tax is sometimes, not only farmed for a certain rent,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt624" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt624_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> but the<span class="type-margin"><span>Taxation by monopolies let to farm is even worse.</span></span> farmer has, besides, the monopoly of the commodity taxed. In France, the duties<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt625" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt625_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 upon tobacco and salt are levied in this manner. In such cases the
farmer, instead of one, levies two exorbitant profits upon the people;
the profit of the farmer, and the still more exorbitant one of the
monopolist. Tobacco being a luxury, every man is allowed to buy or not
to buy as he chuses. But salt being a necessary, every man is obliged to
 buy of the farmer a certain quantity of it; because, if he did not buy
this quantity of the farmer, he would, it is presumed, buy it of some
smuggler. The taxes upon both commodities are exorbitant. The temptation
 to smuggle consequently is to many people irresistible, while at the
same time the rigour of the law, and the vigilance of the farmer’s
officers, render the yielding to that temptation almost certainly
ruinous. The smuggling of salt and tobacco sends every year several
hundred people to the gallies, besides a very considerable number whom
it sends to the gibbet. Those taxes levied in this manner yield a very
considerable revenue to government. In 1767, the farm of tobacco was let
 for twenty-two <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>388<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 millions five hundred and forty-one thousand two hundred and
seventy-eight livres a year. That of salt, for thirty-six millions four
hundred and ninety-two thousand four hundred and four livres. The farm
in both cases was to commence in 1768, and to last for six years. Those
who consider the blood of the people as nothing in comparison with the
revenue of the prince, may perhaps approve of this method of levying
taxes. Similar taxes and monopolies of salt and tobacco have been
established in many other countries; particularly in the Austrian and
Prussian dominions, and in the greater part of the states of Italy.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_947"><span class="type-margin"><span>In France the three branches of revenue which are levied by government officers are much more economical.</span></span>In
 France, the greater part of the actual revenue of the crown is derived
from eight different sources; the taille, the capitation, the two
vingtiemes, the gabelles, the aides, the traites, the domaine, and the
farm of tobacco. The five last are, in the greater part of the
provinces, under farm. The three first are every where levied by an
administration under the immediate inspection and direction of
government, and it is universally acknowledged that, in proportion to
what they taken out of the pockets of the people, they bring more into
the treasury of the prince than the other five, of which the
administration is much more wasteful and expensive.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_948"><span class="type-margin"><span>The taille and
 capitations should be abolished, the vingtièmes increased, the taxes on
 commodities made uniform, and farming abolished</span></span>The
finances of France seem, in their present state, to admit of three very
obvious reformations. First, by abolishing the taille and the
capitation, and by encreasing the number of vingtiemes, so as to produce
 an additional revenue equal to the amount of those other taxes, the
revenue of the crown might be preserved; the expence of collection might
 be much diminished; the vexation of the inferior ranks of people, which
 the taille and capitation occasion, might be entirely prevented; and
the superior ranks might not be more burdened than the greater part of
them are at present. The vingtieme, I have already observed,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt626" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt626_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 is a tax very nearly of the same kind with what is called the land-tax
of England. The burden of the taille, it is acknowledged, falls finally
upon the proprietors of land; and as the greater part of the capitation
is assessed upon those who are subject to the taille at so much a pound
of that other tax, the final payment of the greater part of it must
likewise fall upon the same order of people. Though the number of the
vingtiemes, therefore, was increased so as to produce an additional
revenue equal to the amount of both those taxes, the superior ranks of
people might not be more burdened than they are at present. Many
individuals no doubt would, on account of the great inequalities with
which the taille is commonly assessed upon the estates and tenants of
different <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>389<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 individuals. The interest and opposition of such favoured subjects are
the obstacles most likely to prevent this or any other reformation of
the same kind. Secondly, by rendering the gabelle, the aides, the
traites,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt627" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt627_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 the taxes upon tobacco, all the different customs and excises, uniform
in all the different parts of the kingdom, those taxes might be levied
at much less expence, and the interior commerce of the kingdom might be
rendered as free as that of England. Thirdly, and lastly, by subjecting
all those taxes to an administration under the immediate inspection and
direction of government, the exorbitant profits of the farmers general
might be added to the revenue of the state. The opposition arising from
the private interest of individuals, is likely to be as effectual for
preventing the two last as the first mentioned scheme of reformation.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_949">The French system of taxation seems, in every respect, inferior to<span class="type-margin"><span>The French system is in every respect inferior to the British</span></span>
 the British. In Great Britain ten millions sterling are annually levied
 upon less than eight millions of people, without its being possible to
say that any particular order is oppressed. From the collections of the
Abbé Expilly,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt628" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt628_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> and the observations of the author of the Essay upon the legislation and commerce of corn,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt629" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt629_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 it appears probable, that France, including the provinces of Lorraine
and Bar, contains about twenty-three or twenty-four millions of people;
three times the number perhaps contained in Great Britain. The soil and
climate of France are better than those of Great Britain. The country
has been much longer in a state of improvement and cultivation, and is,
upon that account, better stocked with all those things which it
requires a long time to raise up and accumulate, such as great towns,
and convenient and well-built houses, both in town and country. With
these advantages, it might be expected that in France a revenue of
thirty millions might be levied for the support of the state, with as
little inconveniency as a revenue of ten millions is in Great Britain.
In 1765 and 1766, the whole revenue paid into the treasury of France,
according to the best, though, I acknowledge, very imperfect, accounts
which I could get of it, usually run between 308 and 325 millions of
livres; that is, it did not amount to fifteen millions sterling; not the
 half of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>390<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 what might have been expected, had the people contributed in the same
proportion to their numbers as the people of Great Britain. The people
of France, however, it is generally acknowledged, are much more
oppressed by taxes than the people of Great Britain. France, however, is
 certainly the great empire in Europe which, after that of Great
Britain, enjoys the mildest and most indulgent government.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_950"><span class="type-margin"><span>In Holland heavy taxes on necessaries have ruined manufactures.</span></span>In Holland the heavy taxes upon the necessaries of life have ruined, it is said, their principal manufactures,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt630" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt630_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 and are likely to discourage gradually even their fisheries and their
trade in ship-building. The taxes upon the necessaries of life are
inconsiderable in Great Britain, and no manufacture has hitherto been
ruined by them. The British taxes which bear hardest on manufactures are
 some duties upon the importation of raw materials, particularly upon
that of raw silk. The revenue of the states general and of the different
 cities, however, is said to amount to more than five millions two
hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling; and as the inhabitants of
the United Provinces cannot well be supposed to amount to more than a
third part of those of Great Britain, they must, in proportion to their
number, be much more heavily taxed.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_951"><span class="type-margin"><span>But perhaps Holland has done the best possible</span></span>After
 all the proper subjects of taxation have been exhausted, if the
exigencies of the state still continue to require new taxes, they must
be imposed upon improper ones.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt631" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt631_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 The taxes upon the necessaries of life, therefore, may be no
impeachment of the wisdom of that republic, which, in order to acquire
and to maintain its independency, has, in spite of its great frugality,
been involved in such expensive wars as have obliged it to contract
great debts. The singular countries of Holland and Zealand, besides,
require a considerable expence even to preserve their existence, or to
prevent their being swallowed up by the sea, which must have contributed
 to increase considerably the load of taxes in those two provinces. The
republican form of government seems to be the principal support of the
present grandeur of Holland. The owners of great capitals, the great
mercantile families, have generally either some direct share, or some
indirect influence, in the administration of that government. For the
sake of the respect and authority which they derive from this situation,
 they are willing to live in a country where their capital, if they
employ it themselves, will bring them less profit, and if they lend it
to another, less interest; and where the very moderate revenue which
they can draw from it will purchase less of the necessaries and
conveniences of life than in <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>391<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 any other part of Europe. The residence of such wealthy people
necessarily keeps alive, in spite of all disadvantages, a certain degree
 of industry in the country. Any public calamity which should destroy
the republican form of government, which should throw the whole
administration into the hands of nobles and of soldiers, which should
annihilate altogether the importance of those wealthy merchants, would
soon render it disagreeable to them to live in a country where they were
 no longer likely to be much respected. They would remove both their
residence and their capital to some other country, and the industry and
commerce of Holland would soon follow the capitals which supported them.</p>

<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-02_952"><span class="type-margin"><span>When expensive luxuries are unknown, persons with large revenue are likely to hoard savings</span></span>IN
 that rude state of society which precedes the extension of commerce and
 the improvement of manufactures, when those expensive luxuries which
commerce and manufactures can alone introduce, are altogether unknown,
the person who possesses a large revenue, I have endeavoured to show in
the third book of this Inquiry,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt632" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt632_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 can spend or enjoy that revenue in no other way than by maintaining
nearly as many people as it can maintain. A large revenue may at all
times be said to consist in the command of a large quantity of the
necessaries of life. In that rude state of things it is commonly paid in
 a large quantity of those necessaries, in the materials of plain food
and coarse clothing, in corn and cattle, in wool and raw hides. When
neither commerce nor manufactures furnish any thing for which the owner
can exchange the greater part of those materials which are over and
above his own consumption, he can do nothing with the surplus but feed
and clothe nearly as many people as it will feed and clothe. A
hospitality in which there is no luxury, and a liberality in which there
 is no ostentation, occasion, in this situation of things, the principal
 expences of the rich and the great. But these, I have likewise
endeavoured to show in the same book,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt633" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt633_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 are expences by which people are not very apt to ruin themselves. There
 is not, perhaps, any selfish pleasure so frivolous, of which the
pursuit has not sometimes ruined even sensible men. A passion for
cock-fighting has ruined many. But the instances, I believe, are not
very numerous of people who have been ruined by a hospitality or
liberality of this kind; though the hospitality of luxury and the
liberality of ostentation have ruined many. Among our feudal ancestors,
the long time during which estates used to continue in the same family,
sufficiently demonstrates <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>393<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 the general disposition of people to live within their income. Though
the rustic hospitality, constantly exercised by the great land-holders,
may not, to us in the present times, seem consistent with that order,
which we are apt to consider as inseparably connected with good œconomy,
 yet we must certainly allow them to have been at least so far frugal as
 not commonly to have spent their whole income. A part of their wool and
 raw hides they had generally an opportunity of selling for money. Some
part of this money, perhaps, they spent in purchasing the few objects of
 vanity and luxury, with which the circumstances of the times could
furnish them; but some part of it they seem commonly to have hoarded.
They could not well indeed do any thing else but hoard whatever money
they saved. To trade was disgraceful to a gentleman, and to lend money
at interest, which at that time was considered as usury and prohibited
by law, would have been still more so. In those times of violence and
disorder, besides, it was convenient to have a hoard of money at hand,
that in case they should be driven from their own home, they might have
something of known value to carry with them to some place of safety. The
 same violence, which made it convenient to hoard, made it equally
convenient to conceal the hoard. The frequency of treasure-trove, or of
treasure found of which no owner was known, sufficiently demonstrates
the frequency in those times both of hoarding and of concealing the
hoard. Treasure-trove was then considered as an important branch of the
revenue of the sovereign.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt634" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt634_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 All the treasure-trove of the kingdom would scarce perhaps in the
present times make an important branch of the revenue of a private
gentleman of a good estate.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_953">The same disposition to save and to hoard prevailed in the sovereign,<span class="type-margin"><span>So the ancient sovereigns of Europe amassed treasures</span></span>
 as well as in the subjects. Among nations to whom commerce and
manufactures are little known, the sovereign, it has already been
observed in the fourth book,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt635" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt635_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 is in a situation which naturally disposes him to the parsimony
requisite for accumulation. In that situation the expence even of a
sovereign cannot be directed by that vanity which delights in the gaudy
finery of a court. The ignorance of the times affords but few of the
trinkets in which that finery consists. Standing armies are not then
necessary, so that the expence even of a sovereign, like that of any
other great lord, can be employed in scarce any thing but bounty to his
tenants, and hospitality to his retainers. But bounty and hospitality
very seldom lead to extravagance; <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>394<span class="bracket">]</span></span> though vanity almost always does.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt636" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt636_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 All the ancient sovereigns of Europe accordingly, it has already been
observed, had treasures. Every Tartar chief in the present times is said
 to have one.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_954"><span class="type-margin"><span>When luxuries are introduced, the sovereign’s expenditure equals his revenue in time of peace,</span></span>In
 a commercial country abounding with every sort of expensive luxury, the
 sovereign, in the same manner as almost all the great proprietors in
his dominions, naturally spends a great part of his revenue in
purchasing those luxuries. His own and the neighbouring countries supply
 him abundantly with all the costly trinkets which compose the splendid,
 but insignificant pageantry of a court. For the sake of an inferior
pageantry of the same kind, his nobles dismiss their retainers, make
their tenants independent, and become gradually themselves as
insignificant as the greater part of the wealthy burghers in his
dominions. The same frivolous passions, which influence their conduct,
influence his. How can it be supposed that he should be the only rich
man in his dominions who is insensible to pleasures of this kind? If he
does not, what he is very likely to do, spend upon those pleasures so
great a part of his revenue as to debilitate very much the defensive
power of the state, it cannot well be expected that he should not spend
upon them all that part of it which is over and above what is necessary
for supporting that defensive power. His ordinary expence becomes equal
to his ordinary revenue, and it is well if it does not frequently exceed
 it. The amassing of treasure can no longer be expected, and when
extraordinary exigencies require extraordinary expences, he must
necessarily call upon his subjects for an extraordinary aid. The present
 and the late king of Prussia are the only great princes of Europe, who,
 since the death of Henry IV. of France in 1610, are supposed to have
amassed any considerable treasure.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt637" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt637_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 The parsimony which leads to accumulation has become almost as rare in
republican as in monarchical governments. The Italian republics, the
United Provinces of the Netherlands, are all in debt. The canton of
Berne is the single republic in Europe which has amassed any
considerable treasure.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt638" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt638_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 The other Swiss republics have not. The taste for some sort of
pageantry, for splendid buildings, at least, and other public ornaments,
 frequently prevails as much in the apparently sober senate-house of a
little republic, as in the dissipated court of the greatest king.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_955"><span class="type-margin"><span>and in time of war he contracts debts</span></span>The
 want of parsimony in time of peace, imposes the necessity of
contracting debt in time of war. When war comes, there is no money in
the treasury but what is necessary for carrying on the ordinary expence <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>395<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of the peace establishment. In war an establishment of three or four
times that expence becomes necessary for the defence of the state, and
consequently a revenue three or four times greater than the peace
revenue. Supposing that the sovereign should have, what he scarce ever
has, the immediate means of augmenting his revenue in proportion to the
augmentation of his expence, yet still the produce of the taxes, from
which this increase of revenue must be drawn, will not begin to come
into the treasury till perhaps ten or twelve months after they are
imposed. But the moment in which war begins, or rather the moment in
which it appears likely to begin, the army must be augmented, the fleet
must be fitted out, the garrisoned towns must be put into a posture of
defence; that army, that fleet, those garrisoned towns must be furnished
 with arms, ammunition, and provisions. An immediate and great expence
must be incurred in that moment of immediate danger, which will not wait
 for the gradual and slow returns of the new taxes. In this exigency
government can have no other resource but in borrowing.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_956">The same commercial state of society which, by the operation of<span class="type-margin"><span>The same causes which make borrowing necessary make it possible</span></span>
 moral causes, brings government in this manner into the necessity of
borrowing, produces in the subjects both an ability and an inclination
to lend. If it commonly brings along with it the necessity of borrowing,
 it likewise brings along<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt639" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt639_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> with it the facility of doing so.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_957">A country abounding with merchants and manufacturers, necessarily<span class="type-margin"><span>Merchants and manufacturers are able to lend,</span></span>
 abounds with a set of people through whose hands not only their own
capitals, but the capitals of all those who either lend them money, or
trust them with goods, pass as frequently, or more frequently, than the
revenue of a private man, who, without trade or business, lives upon his
 income, passes through his hands. The revenue of such a man can
regularly pass through his hands only once in a year. But the whole
amount of the capital and credit of a merchant, who deals in a trade of
which the returns are very quick, may sometimes pass through his hands
two, three, or four times in a year. A country abounding with merchants
and manufacturers, therefore, necessarily abounds with a set of people
who have it at all times in their power to advance, if they chuse to do
so, a very large sum of money to government. Hence the ability in the
subjects of a commercial state to lend.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_958">Commerce and manufactures can seldom flourish long in any state<span class="type-margin"><span>and also willing</span></span>
 which does not enjoy a regular administration of justice, in which the
people do not feel themselves secure in the possession of their
property, in which the faith of contracts is not supported by law, and
in which the authority of the state is not supposed to be regularly
employed <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>396<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 in enforcing the payment of debts from all those who are able to pay.
Commerce and manufactures, in short, can seldom flourish in any state in
 which there is not a certain degree of confidence in the justice of
government. The same confidence which disposes great merchants and
manufacturers, upon ordinary occasions, to trust their property to the
protection of a particular government; disposes them, upon extraordinary
 occasions, to trust that government with the use of their property. By
lending money to government, they do not even for a moment diminish
their ability to carry on their trade and manufactures. On the contrary,
 they commonly augment it. The necessities of the state render
government upon most occasions willing to borrow upon terms extremely
advantageous to the lender. The security which it grants to the original
 creditor, is made transferable to any other creditor, and, from the
universal confidence in the justice of the state, generally sells in the
 market for more than was originally paid for it. The merchant or monied
 man makes money by lending money to government, and instead of
diminishing, increases his trading capital. He generally considers it as
 a favour, therefore, when the administration admits him to a share in
the first subscription for a new loan. Hence the inclination or
willingness in the subjects of a commercial state to lend.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_959"><span class="type-margin"><span>A government dispenses itself from saving if it knows it can borrow,</span></span>The
 government of such a state is very apt to repose itself upon this
ability and willingness of its subjects to lend it their money on
extraordinary occasions. It foresees the facility of borrowing, and
therefore dispenses itself from the duty of saving.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_960"><span class="type-margin"><span>whereas if there is no possibility of borrowing, it feels it must save.</span></span>In
 a rude state of society there are no great mercantile or manufacturing
capitals. The individuals, who hoard whatever money they can save, and
who conceal their hoard, do so from a distrust of the justice of
government, from a fear that if it was known that they had a hoard, and
where that hoard was to be found, they would quickly be plundered. In
such a state of things few people would be able, and no body would be
willing, to lend their money to government on extraordinary exigencies.
The sovereign feels that he must provide for such exigencies by saving,
because he foresees the absolute impossibility of borrowing. This
foresight increases still further his natural disposition to save.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_961"><span class="type-margin"><span>Nations have begun to borrow without special security and have afterwards mortgaged particular funds.</span></span>The
 progress of the enormous debts which at present oppress, and will in
the long-run probably ruin, all the great nations of Europe, has been
pretty uniform. Nations, like private men, have generally begun to
borrow upon what may be called personal credit, without assigning or
mortgaging any particular fund for the payment of the debt; and <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>397<span class="bracket">]</span></span> when this resource has failed them, they have gone on to borrow upon assignments or mortgages of particular funds.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_962">What is called the unfunded debt of Great Britain, is contracted in<span class="type-margin"><span>The unfunded debt of Great Britain is contracted in the first way</span></span>
 the former of those two ways. It consists partly in a debt which bears,
 or is supposed to bear, no interest, and which resembles the debts that
 a private man contracts upon account; and partly in a debt which bears
interest, and which resembles what a private man contracts upon his bill
 or promissory note. The debts which are due either for extraordinary
services, or for services either not provided for, or not paid at the
time when they are performed; part of the extraordinaries of the army,
navy, and ordnance, the arrears of subsidies to foreign princes, those
of seamen’s wages, &amp;c. usually constitute a debt of the first kind.
Navy and Exchequer bills, which are issued sometimes in payment of a
part of such debts and sometimes for other purposes, constitute a debt
of the second kind; Exchequer bills bearing interest from the day on
which they are issued, and navy bills six months after they are issued.
The bank of England, either by voluntarily discounting those bills at
their current value, or by agreeing with government for certain
considerations to circulate Exchequer bills, that is, to receive them at
 par, paying the interest which happens to be due upon them, keeps up
their value and facilitates their circulation, and thereby frequently
enables government to contract a very large debt of this kind. In
France, where there is no bank, the state bills (billets d’état<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt640" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt640_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>)
 have sometimes sold at sixty and seventy per cent. discount. During the
 great re-coinage in King William’s time, when the bank of England
thought proper to put a stop to its usual transactions, Exchequer bills
and tallies are said to have sold from twenty-five to sixty per cent.
discount;<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt641" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt641_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 owing partly, no doubt, to the supposed instability of the new
government established by the Revolution, but partly too to the want of
the support of the bank of England.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_963">When this resource is exhausted, and it becomes necessary, in order<span class="type-margin"><span>Mortgages
 of particular branches of revenue are either for a term of years, when
money is said to be raised by anticipation, or in perpetuity, when it is
 said to be raised by funding.</span></span> to raise money, to assign
or mortgage some particular branch of the public revenue for the payment
 of the debt, government has upon different occasions done this in two
different ways. Sometimes it has made this assignment or mortgage for a
short period of time only, a year, or a few years, for example; and
sometimes for perpetuity. In <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>398<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 the one case, the fund was supposed sufficient to pay, within the
limited time, both principal and interest of the money borrowed. In the
other, it was supposed sufficient to pay the interest only, or a
perpetual annuity equivalent to the interest, government being at
liberty to redeem at any time this annuity, upon paying back the
principal sum borrowed. When money was raised in the one way, it was
said to be raised by anticipation; when in the other, by perpetual
funding, or, more shortly, by funding.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_964"><span class="type-margin"><span>The annual land and malt taxes are always anticipated</span></span>In
 Great Britain the annual land and malt taxes are regularly anticipated
every year, by virtue of a borrowing clause constantly inserted into the
 acts which impose them. The bank of England generally advances at an
interest, which since the Revolution has varied from eight to three per
cent. the sums for which those taxes are granted, and receives payment
as their produce gradually comes in. If there is a deficiency, which
there always is, it is provided for in the supplies of the ensuing year.
 The only considerable branch of the public revenue which yet remains
unmortgaged is thus regularly spent before it comes in. Like an
improvident<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt642" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt642_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 spendthrift, whose pressing occasions will not allow him to wait for
the regular payment of his revenue, the state is in the constant
practice of borrowing of its own factors and agents, and of paying
interest for the use of its own money.</p>

 the reign of king William, and during a great part of that of queen
Anne, before we had become so familiar as we are now with the practice
of perpetual funding, the greater part of the new taxes were imposed but
 for a short period of time (for four, five, six, or seven years only),
and a great part of the grants of every year consisted in loans upon
anticipations of the produce of those taxes. The produce being
frequently insufficient for paying within the limited term the principal
 and interest of the money borrowed, deficiencies arose, to make good

 consequence of those different acts, the greater part of the taxes
which before had been anticipated only for a short term of years, were
rendered perpetual as a fund for paying, not the capital, but the
interest only, of the money which had been borrowed upon them by
different successive anticipations.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_977"><span class="type-margin"><span>When once become familiar, perpetual funding is preferred to anticipation</span></span>Had
 money never been raised but by anticipation, the course of a few years
would have liberated the public revenue, without any other attention of
government besides that of not overloading the fund by charging it with
more debt than it could pay within the limited term, and of not
anticipating a second time before the expiration of the first
anticipation. But the greater part of European governments have been
incapable of those attentions. They have frequently overloaded the fund
even upon the first anticipation; and when this happened not to be the
case, they have generally taken care to overload it, by anticipating a
second and a third time before the expiration of the first anticipation.
 The fund becoming in this manner altogether insufficient for paying
both principal and interest of the money borrowed upon it, it became
necessary to charge it with the interest only, or a perpetual annuity
equal to the interest, and such unprovident anticipations necessarily
gave birth to the more ruinous practice of perpetual funding. But though
 this practice necessarily puts off the liberation of the public revenue
 from a fixed period to one so indefinite that it is not very likely
ever to arrive; yet as a greater sum can in all cases be raised by this
new practice than by the old one of anticipations, the former, when men
have once become familiar with it, has in the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>401<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 great exigencies of the state been universally preferred to the latter.
 To relieve the present exigency is always the object which principally
interests those immediately concerned in the administration of public
affairs. The future liberation of the public revenue, they leave to the
care of posterity.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_978">During the reign of queen Anne, the market rate of interest had<span class="type-margin"><span>A fall in the market rate of interest led to a saving, which gave rise to the Sinking Fund</span></span>
 fallen from six to five per cent., and in the twelfth year of her reign
 five per cent. was declared to be the highest rate which could lawfully
 be taken for money borrowed upon private security.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt656" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt656_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Soon after the greater part of the temporary taxes of Great Britain had
 been rendered perpetual, and distributed into the Aggregate, South Sea,
 and General Funds, the creditors of the public, like those of private
persons, were induced to accept of five per cent. for the interest of
their money,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt657" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt657_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 which occasioned a saving of one per cent. upon the capital of the
greater part of the debts which had been thus funded for perpetuity, or
of one-sixth of the greater part of the annuities which were paid out of
 the three great funds above mentioned. This saving left a considerable
surplus in the produce of the different taxes which had been accumulated
 into those funds, over and above what was necessary for paying the
annuities which were now charged upon them, and laid the foundation of
what has since been called the Sinking Fund. In 1717, it amounted to

 very much the contracting of new debts. It is a subsidiary fund always
at hand to be mortgaged in aid of any other doubtful fund, upon which
money is proposed to be raised in any exigency of the state. Whether the
 sinking fund of Great Britain has been more frequently applied to the
one or to the other of those two purposes, will sufficiently appear by
and by.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_980">Besides those two methods of borrowing, by anticipations and by<span class="type-margin"><span>Money is also borrowed by terminable and life annuities</span></span>
 perpetual funding, there are two other methods, which hold a sort of
middle place between them. These are, that of borrowing upon annuities
for terms of years, and that of borrowing upon annuities for lives.</p>

<p id="Smith_0206-02_981"><span class="type-margin"><span>Under William III. and Anne large sums were borrowed on annuities for terms of years</span></span>During
 the reigns of king William and queen Anne, large sums were frequently
borrowed upon annuities for terms of years, which were sometimes longer
and sometimes shorter. In 1693, an act was passed for borrowing one
million upon an annuity of fourteen per cent.,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt661" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt661_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> or of 140,000 <span class="ital">l.</span>
 a year, for sixteen years. In 1691, an act was passed for borrowing a
million upon annuities for lives, upon terms which in the present times
would appear very advantageous. But the subscription was not filled up.
In the following year<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt662" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt662_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 the deficiency was made good by borrowing upon annuities for lives at
fourteen per cent., or at little more than seven years purchase. In
1695, the persons who had purchased those annuities were allowed to
exchange them for others of ninety-six years, upon paying into the
Exchequer sixty-three pounds in the hundred; that is, the difference
between fourteen per cent. for life, and fourteen per cent. for
ninety-six years, was sold for sixty-three pounds, or for four and a
half years purchase. Such was the supposed instability of government,
that even these terms procured few purchasers. In the reign of queen
Anne, money was upon different occasions borrowed both upon annuities
for lives, and upon annuities for terms of thirty-two, of eighty-nine,
of ninety-eight, and of ninety-nine years. In 1719, the proprietors of
the annuities for thirty-two years were induced to accept in lieu of
them South Sea stock to the amount of eleven and a half years purchase
of the annuities, together with an additional quantity of stock equal to
 the arrears which happened then to be due upon them.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt663" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt663_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 In 1720, the greater part of the other annuities for terms of years
both long and short were subscribed into the same fund. The long
annuities at that time amounted to 666,821 <span class="ital">l.</span> 8 <span class="ital">s.</span> 3½ <span class="ital">d.</span> a year.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt664" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt664_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> On the 5th of January, 1775, the remainder of them, or what was not subscribed at that time, amounted only to 136,453 <span class="ital">l.</span> 12 <span class="ital">s.</span> 8 <span class="ital">d.</span></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_982"><span class="type-margin"><span>But little
money was so borrowed in the wars of the middle of the eighteenth
century, most people preferring a perpetual annuity,</span></span>During
 the two wars which begun in 1739 and in 1755, little money was borrowed
 either upon annuities for terms of years, or upon those for lives. An
annuity for ninety-eight or ninety-nine years, however, is worth nearly
as much money as a perpetuity, and should, therefore, one might think,
be a fund for borrowing nearly as much. But those who, in order to make
family settlements, and to provide for remote futurity, buy into the
public stocks, would not care to purchase into one of which the value
was continually diminishing; and such people make a very considerable
proportion both of the proprietors and purchasers of stock. An annuity
for a long term of years, therefore, though its intrinsic value may be
very nearly the same with that of a <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>403<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 perpetual annuity, will not find nearly the same number of purchasers.
The subscribers to a new loan, who mean generally to sell their
subscription as soon as possible, prefer greatly a perpetual annuity
redeemable by parliament, to an irredeemable annuity for a long term of
years of only equal amount. The value of the former may be supposed
always the same, or very nearly the same; and it makes, therefore, a
more convenient transferable stock than the latter.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_983">During the two last mentioned wars, annuities, either for terms of<span class="type-margin"><span>and annuities for terms and for lives were only given as premiums.</span></span>
 years or for lives, were seldom granted but as premiums to the
subscribers to a new loan, over and above the redeemable annuity or
interest upon the credit of which the loan was supposed to be made. They
 were granted, not as the proper fund upon which the money was borrowed;
 but as an additional encouragement to the lender.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_984">Annuities for lives have occasionally been granted in two different<span class="type-margin"><span>Tontines are preferred to annuities on separate lives, though they do not liberate the public revenue so quickly.</span></span>
 ways; either upon separate lives, or upon lots of lives, which in
French are called Tontines, from the name of their inventor. When
annuities are granted upon separate lives, the death of every individual
 annuitant disburthens the public revenue so far as it was affected by
his annuity. When annuities are granted upon tontines, the liberation of
 the public revenue does not commence till the death of all the
annuitants comprehended in one lot, which may sometimes consist of
twenty or thirty persons, of whom the survivors succeed to the annuities
 of all those who die before them; the last survivor succeeding to the
annuities of the whole lot. Upon the same revenue more money can always
be raised by tontines than by annuities for separate lives. An annuity,
with a right of survivorship, is really worth more than an equal annuity
 for a separate life, and from the confidence which every man naturally
has in his own good fortune, the principle upon which is founded the
success of all lotteries, such an annuity generally sells for something
more than it is worth. In countries where it is usual for government to
raise money by granting annuities, tontines are upon this account
generally preferred to annuities for separate lives. The expedient which
 will raise most money, is almost always preferred to that which is
likely to bring about in the speediest manner the liberation of the
public revenue.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_985">In France a much greater proportion of the public debts consists in<span class="type-margin"><span>In France a much greater proportion of the whole debt is in life annuities than in England</span></span>
 annuities for lives than in England. According to a memoir presented by
 the parliament of Bourdeaux to the king in 1764, the whole public debt
of France is estimated at twenty-four hundred millions of livres; of
which the capital for which annuities for lives had been granted, is
supposed to amount to three hundred millions, the eighth part of the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>404<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 whole public debt. The annuities themselves are computed to amount to
thirty millions a year, the fourth part of one hundred and twenty
millions, the supposed interest of that whole debt. These estimations, I
 know very well, are not exact, but having been presented by so very
respectable a body as approximations to the truth, they may, I
apprehend, be considered as such. It is not the different degrees of
anxiety in the two governments of France and England for the liberation
of the public revenue, which occasions this difference in their
respective modes of borrowing. It arises altogether from the different
views and interests of the lenders.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_986"><span class="type-margin"><span>the difference is due to the fact that in England the lenders are merchants,</span></span>In
 England, the seat of government being in the greatest mercantile city
in the world, the merchants are generally the people who advance money
to government. By advancing it they do not mean to diminish, but, on the
 contrary, to increase their mercantile capitals; and unless they
expected to sell with some profit their share in the subscription for a
new loan, they never would subscribe. But if by advancing their money
they were to purchase, instead of perpetual annuities, annuities for
lives only, whether their own or those of other people, they would not
always be so likely to sell them with a profit. Annuities upon their own
 lives they would always sell with loss; because no man will give for an
 annuity upon the life of another, whose age and state of health are
nearly the same with his own, the same price which he would give for one
 upon his own. An annuity upon the life of a third person, indeed, is,
no doubt, of equal value to the buyer and the seller; but its real value
 begins to diminish from the moment it is granted, and continues to do
so more and more as long as it subsists. It can never, therefore, make
so convenient a transferable stock as a perpetual annuity, of which the
real value may be supposed always the same, or very nearly the same.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_987"><span class="type-margin"><span>whereas in France they are persons engaged in the farming and collection of the taxes, who are chiefly bachelors.</span></span>In
 France the seat of government not being in a great mercantile city,
merchants do not make so great a proportion of the people who advance
money to government. The people concerned in the finances, the farmers
general, the receivers of the taxes which are not in farm, the court
bankers, &amp;c. make the greater part of those who advance their money
in all public exigencies. Such people are commonly men of mean birth,
but of great wealth, and frequently of great pride. They are too proud
to marry their equals, and women of quality disdain to marry them. They
frequently resolve, therefore, to live bachelors, and having neither any
 families of their own, nor much regard for those of their relations,
whom they are not always very fond of acknowledging, they desire only to
 live in splendour during their own time, and are not <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>405<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 unwilling that their fortune should end with themselves. The number of
rich people, besides, who are either averse to marry, or whose condition
 of life renders it either improper or inconvenient for them to do so,
is much greater in France than in England. To such people, who have
little or no care for posterity, nothing can be more convenient than to
exchange their capital for a revenue, which is to last just as long,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt665" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt665_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> and no longer than they wish it to do.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_988">The ordinary expence of the greater part of modern governments<span class="type-margin"><span>The system of perpetual funding prevents the people from feeling distinctly the burden of war.</span></span>
 in time of peace being equal or nearly equal to their ordinary revenue,
 when war comes, they are both unwilling and unable to increase their
revenue in proportion to the increase of their expence. They are
unwilling, for fear of offending the people, who by so great and so
sudden an increase of taxes, would soon be disgusted with the war; and
they are unable, from not well knowing what taxes would be sufficient to
 produce the revenue wanted. The facility of borrowing delivers them
from the embarrassment which this fear and inability would otherwise
occasion. By means of borrowing they are enabled, with a very moderate
increase of taxes, to raise, from year to year, money sufficient for
carrying on the war, and by the practice of perpetual funding they are
enabled, with the smallest possible increase of taxes, to raise annually
 the largest possible sum of money. In great empires the people who live
 in the capital, and in the provinces remote from the scene of action,
feel, many of them, scarce any inconveniency from the war; but enjoy, at
 their ease, the amusement of reading in the newspapers the exploits of
their own fleets and armies. To them this amusement compensates the
small difference between the taxes which they pay on account of the war,
 and those which they had been accustomed to pay in time of peace. They
are commonly dissatisfied with the return of peace, which puts an end to
 their amusement, and to a thousand visionary hopes of conquest and
national glory, from a longer continuance of the war.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_989">The return of peace, indeed, seldom relieves them from the greater<span class="type-margin"><span>Their burdens are not reduced on the conclusion of peace</span></span>
 part of the taxes imposed during the war. These are mortgaged for the
interest of the debt contracted in order to carry it on. If, over and
above paying the interest of this debt, and defraying the ordinary
expence of government, the old revenue, together with the new taxes,
produce some surplus revenue, it may perhaps be converted into a sinking
 fund for paying off the debt. But, in the first place, this sinking
fund, even supposing it should be applied to no other purpose, is
generally altogether inadequate for paying, in the course <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>406<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of any period during which it can reasonably be expected that peace
should continue, the whole debt contracted during the war; and, in the
second place, this fund is almost always applied to other purposes.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_990"><span class="type-margin"><span>Any new taxes
imposed are rarely sufficient to do more than pay the new interest.
Sinking funds arise generally from reductions of interest</span></span>The
 new taxes were imposed for the sole purpose of paying the interest of
the money borrowed upon them. If they produce more, it is generally
something which was neither intended nor expected, and is therefore
seldom very considerable. Sinking funds have generally arisen, not so
much from any surplus of the taxes which was over and above what was
necessary for paying the interest or annuity originally charged upon
them, as from a subsequent reduction of that interest. That of Holland
in 1655, and that of the ecclesiastical state in 1685, were both formed
in this manner.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt666" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt666_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> Hence the usual insufficiency of such funds.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_991"><span class="type-margin"><span>and are constantly misapplied.</span></span>During
 the most profound peace, various events occur which require an
extraordinary expence, and government finds it always more convenient to
 defray this expence by misapplying the sinking fund than by imposing a
new tax. Every new tax is immediately felt more or less by the people.
It occasions always some murmur, and meets with some opposition. The
more taxes may have been multiplied, the higher they may have been
raised upon every different subject of taxation; the more loudly the
people complain of every new tax, the more difficult it becomes too
either to find out new subjects of taxation, or to raise much higher the
 taxes already imposed upon the old. A momentary suspension of the
payment of debt is not immediately felt by the people, and occasions
neither murmur nor complaint. To borrow of the sinking fund is always an
 obvious and easy expedient for getting out of the present difficulty.
The more the public debts may have been accumulated, the more necessary
it may have become to study to reduce them, the more dangerous, the more
 ruinous it may be to misapply any part of the sinking fund; the less
likely is the public debt to be reduced to any considerable degree, the
more likely, the more certainly is the sinking fund to be misapplied
towards defraying all the extraordinary expences which occur in time of
peace. When a nation is already overburdened with taxes, nothing but the
 necessities of a new war, nothing but either the animosity of national
vengeance, or the anxiety for national security, can induce the people
to submit, with tolerable patience, to a new tax. Hence the usual
misapplication of the sinking fund.</p>

<p id="Smith_0206-02_992">In Great Britain, from the time that we had first recourse to the<span class="type-margin"><span>The British debt had its origin in the war of 1688-97,</span></span>
 ruinous expedient of perpetual funding, the reduction of the public
debt in time of peace, has never borne any proportion to its
accumulation in time of war. It was in the war which began in 1688, and
was concluded by the treaty of Ryswick in 1697, that the foundation of
the present enormous debt of Great Britain was first laid.</p>

 A great part of those debts had been contracted upon short

 The reduction of the debt began in 1723, and went on so slowly that, on

 During a peace of about seven years continuance, the prudent and truly
patriot administration of Mr. Pelham, was not able to pay off an old
debt of six millions. During a war of nearly the same continuance, a new
 debt of more than seventy-five millions was contracted.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_997"><span class="type-margin"><span>In the eleven

 Even this small reduction of debt, however, has not been all made from
the savings out of the ordinary revenue of the state. Several extraneous
 sums, altogether independent of that ordinary revenue, have contributed
 towards it. Amongst<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt678" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt678_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">8</a>

 their territorial acquisitions; and the one hundred and ten thousand
pounds received from the bank for the renewal of their charter. To these
 must be added several other sums which, as they arose out of the late
war, ought perhaps to be considered as deductions from the expences of
it. The principal are,</p>

<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-02_998">If we add to this sum the
balance of the earl of Chatham’s and Mr. Calcraft’s accounts, and other
army savings of the same kind, together with what has been received from
 the bank, the East India company, and the additional shilling in the
pound land tax; the whole must be a good deal more than five millions.
The debt, therefore, which since the peace has been paid out of the
savings from the ordinary revenue of the state, has not, one year with
another, amounted to half a million a year. The sinking fund has, no
doubt, been considerably augmented since the peace, by the debt which
has been paid off, by the reduction of the redeemable four per cents. to
 three per cents., and by the annuities for lives which have fallen in,
and, if peace were<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt680" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt680_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 to continue, a million, perhaps, might now be annually spared out of it
 towards the discharge of the debt. Another million, accordingly, was
paid in the course of last year; but, at the same time, a large civil
list debt was left unpaid, and we are now involved in a new war which,
in its progress, may prove as expensive as any of our former wars.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt681" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt681_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 The new debt which will probably be contracted before the end of the
next campaign, may perhaps be nearly equal to all the old debt which has
 been paid off from the savings out of the ordinary revenue of the
state. It would be altogether chimerical, therefore, to expect that the
public debt should ever be completely discharged by any savings which
are likely to be made from that ordinary revenue as it stands at
present.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_999">The public funds of the different indebted nations of Europe, particularly<span class="type-margin"><span>The opinion that the national debt is an additional capital is altogether erroneous</span></span>
 those of England, have by one author been represented as the
accumulation of a great capital superadded to the other capital of the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>410<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 country, by means of which its trade is extended, its manufactures
multiplied, and its lands cultivated and improved much beyond what they
could have been by means of that other capital only.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt682" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt682_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 He does not consider that the capital which the first creditors of the
public advanced to government, was, from the moment in which they
advanced it, a certain portion of the annual produce turned away from
serving in the function of a capital, to serve in that of a revenue;
from maintaining productive labourers to maintain unproductive ones, and
 to be spent and wasted, generally in the course of the year, without
even the hope of any future reproduction. In return for the capital
which they advanced they obtained, indeed, an annuity in the public
funds in most cases of more than equal value. This annuity, no doubt,
replaced to them their capital, and enabled them to carry on their trade
 and business to the same or perhaps to a greater extent than before;
that is, they were enabled either to borrow of other people a new
capital upon the credit of this annuity, or by selling it to get from
other people a new capital of their own, equal or superior to that which
 they had advanced to government. This new capital, however, which they
in this manner either bought or borrowed of other people, must have
existed in the country before, and must have been employed as all
capitals are, in maintaining productive labour. When it came into the
hands of those who had advanced their money to government, though it was
 in some respects a new capital to them, it was not so to the country;
but was only a capital withdrawn from certain employments in order to be
 turned towards others. Though it replaced to them what they had
advanced to government, it did not replace it to the country. Had they
not advanced this capital to government, there would have been in the
country two capitals, two portions of the annual produce, instead of
one, employed in maintaining productive labour.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_1000"><span class="type-margin"><span>When necessary expenditure is met by taxes, it only diverts unproductive labour from one unproductive employment to another.</span></span>When
 for defraying the expence of government a revenue is raised within the
year from the produce of free or unmortgaged taxes, a certain portion of
 the revenue of private people is only turned away from maintaining one
species of unproductive labour, towards maintaining another. Some part
of what they pay in those taxes might no doubt have been accumulated
into capital, and consequently employed in maintaining productive
labour; but the greater part would probably have been spent and
consequently employed in maintaining unproductive <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>411<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 labour. The public expence, however, when defrayed in this manner, no
doubt hinders more or less the further accumulation of new capital; but
it does not necessarily occasion the destruction of any actually
existing capital.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_1001">When the public expence is defrayed by funding, it is defrayed by<span class="type-margin"><span>When
 it is met by borrowing. it diverts labour from productive to
unproductive employment, and the only advantage is that people can
continue to save more during the war,</span></span> the annual
destruction of some capital which had before existed in the country; by
the perversion of some portion of the annual produce which had before
been destined for the maintenance of productive labour, towards that of
unproductive labour. As in this case, however, the taxes are lighter
than they would have been, had a revenue sufficient for defraying the
same expence been raised within the year; the private revenue of
individuals is necessarily less burdened, and consequently their ability
 to save and accumulate some part of that revenue into capital is a good
 deal less impaired. If the method of funding destroy<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt683" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt683_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 more old capital, it at the same time hinders less the accumulation or
acquisition of new capital, than that of defraying the public expence by
 a revenue raised within the year. Under the system of funding, the
frugality and industry of private people can more easily repair the
breaches which the waste and extravagance of government may occasionally
 make in the general capital of the society.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_1002">It is only during the continuance of war, however, that the system<span class="type-margin"><span>which

 of funding has this advantage over the other system. Were the expence
of war to be defrayed always by a revenue raised within the year, the
taxes from which that extraordinary revenue was drawn would last no
longer than the war. The ability of private people to accumulate, though
 less during the war, would have been greater during the peace than
under the system of funding. War would not necessarily have occasioned
the destruction of any old capitals, and peace would have occasioned the
 accumulation of many more new. Wars would in general be more speedily
concluded, and less wantonly undertaken. The people feeling, during the
continuance of the war, the complete burden of it, would soon grow weary
 of it, and government, in order to humour them, would not be under the
necessity of carrying it on longer than it was necessary to do so. The
foresight of the heavy and unavoidable burdens of war would hinder the
people from wantonly calling for it when there was no real or solid
interest to fight for. The seasons during which the ability of private
people to accumulate was somewhat impaired, would occur more rarely, and
 be of shorter continuance. Those on the contrary, during which that
ability was in the highest vigour, would be of much longer duration than
 they can well be under the system of funding.</p>

 progress, the multiplication of taxes which it brings along with it
sometimes impairs as much the ability of private people to accumulate
even in time of peace, as the other system would in time of war. The
peace revenue of Great Britain amounts at present to more than ten
millions a year. If free and unmortgaged, it might be sufficient, with
proper management and without contracting a shilling of new debt, to
carry on the most vigorous war. The private revenue of the inhabitants
of Great Britain is at present as much encumbered in time of peace,
their ability to accumulate is<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt684" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt684_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>

expensive war, had the pernicious system of funding never been adopted.</p>

 The money does not go out of the country. It is only a part of the
revenue of one set of the inhabitants which is transferred to another;
and the nation is not a farthing the poorer. This apology is founded
altogether in the sophistry of the mercantile system, and after the long
 examination which I have already bestowed upon that system, it may
perhaps be unnecessary to say any thing further about it. It supposes,
besides, that the whole public debt is owing to the inhabitants of the
country, which happens not to be true; the Dutch, as well as several
other foreign nations, having a very considerable share in our public
funds. But though the whole debt were owing to the inhabitants of the
country, it would not upon that account be less pernicious.</p>

 and capital stock are the two original sources of all revenue both
private and public. Capital stock pays the wages of productive labour,

employers of capital stock.</p>

 proprietor of land is interested for the sake of his own revenue to
keep his estate in as good condition as he can, by building and

drains and enclosures, and all those other expensive improvements which
it properly belongs to the landlord to make and maintain. But by
different land-taxes the revenue of the landlord may be so much
diminished; and by different duties upon the necessaries and

 of life, that diminished revenue may be rendered of so little real
value, that he may find himself altogether unable to make or maintain
those expensive improvements. When the landlord, however, ceases to do
his part, it is altogether impossible that the tenant should continue to
 do his. As the distress of the landlord increases, the agriculture of
the country must necessarily decline.</p>

revenue they derive from it, will not, in a particular country, purchase
 the same quantity of those necessaries and conveniences which an equal
revenue would in almost any other, they will be disposed to remove to
some other. And when, in order to raise those taxes, all or the greater
part of merchants and manufacturers, that is, all or the greater part of
 the employers of great capitals, come to be continually exposed to the
mortifying and vexatious visits of the tax-gatherers, this disposition
to remove will soon be changed into an actual removal. The industry of
the country will necessarily fall with the removal of the capital which
supported it, and the ruin of trade and manufactures will follow the
declension of agriculture.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_1008">To transfer from the owners of those two great sources of revenue,<span class="type-margin"><span>The

occasion both the neglect of land, and the waste or removal of capital
stock. A creditor of the public has no doubt a general interest in the
prosperity of the agriculture, manufactures, and commerce of the
country; and consequently in the good condition of its lands, and in the
 good management of its capital stock. Should there be any general
failure or declension in any of these things, the produce of the
different taxes might no longer be sufficient to pay him the annuity or
interest which is due to him. But a creditor of the public, considered
merely as such, has no interest in the good condition of any particular
portion of land, or in the good management of any particular portion of
capital stock. As a creditor of the public he has no knowledge of any
such particular portion. He has no inspection of it. He can have no care
 about it. Its ruin may in some<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt686" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt686_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> cases be unknown to him, and cannot directly affect him.</p>

<p id="Smith_0206-02_1009"><span class="type-margin"><span>The practice of funding has always enfeebled states</span></span>The
 practice of funding has gradually enfeebled every state which has
adopted it. The Italian republics seem to have begun it. Genoa and
Venice, the only two remaining which can pretend to an independent
existence, have both been enfeebled by it. Spain seems to have learned
the practice from the Italian republics, and (its taxes being probably
less judicious than theirs) it has, in proportion to its natural
strength, been still more enfeebled. The debts of Spain are of very old
standing. It was deeply in debt before the end of the sixteenth century,
 about a hundred years before England owed a shilling. France,
notwithstanding all its natural resources, languishes under an
oppressive load of the same kind. The republic of the United Provinces
is as much enfeebled by its debts as either Genoa or Venice. Is it
likely that in Great Britain alone a practice, which has brought either
weakness or desolation into every other country, should prove altogether
 innocent?</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_1010"><span class="type-margin"><span>The superiority of the British system of taxation will not enable Britain to support an unlimited burden.</span></span>The
 system of taxation established in those different countries, it may be
said, is inferior to that of England. I believe it is so. But it ought
to be remembered, that when the wisest government has exhausted all the
proper subjects of taxation, it must, in cases of urgent necessity, have
 recourse to improper ones.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt687" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt687_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The wise republic of Holland has upon some occasions been obliged to
have recourse to taxes as inconvenient as the greater part of those of
Spain. Another war begun before any considerable liberation of the
public revenue had been brought about, and growing in its progress as
expensive as the last war, may, from irresistible necessity, render the
British system of taxation as oppressive as that of Holland, or even as
that of Spain. To the honour of our present system of taxation, indeed,
it has hitherto given so little embarrassment to industry, that, during
the course even of the most expensive wars, the frugality and good
conduct of individuals seem<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt688" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt688_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 to have been able, by saving and accumulation, to repair all the
breaches which the waste and extravagance of government had made in the
general capital of the society. At the conclusion of the late war, the
most expensive that Great Britain ever waged, her agriculture was as
flourishing, her manufacturers as numerous and as fully employed, and
her commerce as extensive, as they had ever been before. The capital,
therefore, which supported all those different branches of industry,
must have been equal to what it had ever been before. Since the peace,
agriculture has been still further improved, the rents of houses have
risen in every town and village of the country, a proof of the
increasing wealth and revenue of the people; and the annual amount of
the greater part of the old taxes, of the principal <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>415<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 branches of the excise and customs in particular, has been continually
increasing, an equally clear proof of an increasing consumption, and
consequently of an increasing produce, which could alone support that
consumption. Great Britain seems to support with ease, a burden which,
half a century ago, nobody believed her capable of supporting. Let us
not, however, upon this account rashly conclude that she is capable of
supporting any burden; nor even be too confident that she could support,
 without great distress, a burden a little greater than what has already
 been laid upon her.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_1011">When national debts have once been accumulated to a certain degree,<span class="type-margin"><span>Bankruptcy is always the end of great accumulation of debt.</span></span>
 there is scarce, I believe, a single instance of their having been
fairly and completely paid. The liberation of the public revenue, if it
has ever been brought about at all, has always been brought about by a
bankruptcy; sometimes by an avowed one, but always by a real one, though
 frequently by a pretended payment.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt689" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt689_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_1012">The raising of the denomination of the coin has been the most usual<span class="type-margin"><span>Raising
 the coin has been the usual method of disguising bankruptcy though this
 expedient has much worse consequences than open bankruptcy</span></span>
 expedient by which a real public bankruptcy has been disguised under
the appearance of a pretended payment. If a sixpence, for example,
should either by act of parliament or royal proclamation be raised to
the denomination of a shilling, and twenty sixpences to that of a pound
sterling; the person who under the old denomination had borrowed twenty
shillings, or near four ounces of silver, would, under the new, pay with
 twenty sixpences, or with something less than two ounces. A national
debt of about a hundred and twenty-eight millions, nearly the capital of
 the funded and unfunded debt of Great Britain, might in this manner be
paid with about sixty-four millions of our present money. It would
indeed be a pretended payment only, and the creditors of the public
would really be defrauded of ten shillings in the pound of what was due
to them. The calamity too would extend much further than to the
creditors of the public, and those of every private person would suffer a
 proportionable loss; and this without any advantage, but in most cases
with a great additional loss, to the creditors of the public. If the
creditors of the public indeed were generally much in debt to other
people, they might in some measure compensate their loss by paying their
 creditors in the same coin in which the public had paid them. But in
most countries the creditors of the public are, the greater part of
them, wealthy people, who stand more in the relation of creditors than
in that of debtors towards the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>416<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 rest of their fellow-citizens. A pretended payment of this kind,
therefore, instead of alleviating, aggravates in most cases the loss of
the creditors of the public; and without any advantage to the public,
extends the calamity to a great number of other innocent people. It
occasions a general and most pernicious subversion of the fortunes of
private people; enriching in most cases the idle and profuse debtor at
the expence of the industrious and frugal creditor, and transporting a
great part of the national capital from the hands which were likely to
increase and improve it, to those which are likely to dissipate and
destroy it. When it becomes necessary for a state to declare itself
bankrupt, in the same manner as when it becomes necessary for an
individual to do so, a fair, open, and avowed bankruptcy is always the
measure which is both least dishonourable to the debtor, and least
hurtful to the creditor. The honour of a state is surely very poorly
provided for, when, in order to cover the disgrace of a real bankruptcy,
 it has recourse to a juggling trick of this kind, so easily seen
through, and at the same time so extremely pernicious.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_1013"><span class="type-margin"><span>It has been adopted by many states, including ancient Rome,</span></span>Almost
 all states, however, ancient as well as modern, when reduced to this
necessity, have, upon some occasions, played this very juggling trick.
The Romans, at the end of the first Punic war, reduced the As, the coin
or denomination by which they computed the value of all their other
coins, from containing twelve ounces of copper to contain only two
ounces: that is, they raised two ounces of copper to a denomination
which had always before expressed the value of twelve ounces. The
republic was, in this manner, enabled to pay the great debts which it
had contracted with the sixth part of what it really owed. So sudden and
 so great a bankruptcy, we should in the present times be apt to
imagine, must have occasioned a very violent popular clamour. It does
not appear to have occasioned any. The law which enacted it was, like
all other laws relating to the coin, introduced and carried through the
assembly of the people by a tribune, and was probably a very popular
law. In Rome, as in all the other ancient republics, the poor people
were constantly in debt to the rich and the great, who, in order to
secure their votes at the annual elections, used to lend them money at
exorbitant interest, which, being never paid, soon accumulated into a
sum too great either for the debtor to pay, or for any body else to pay
for him. The debtor, for fear of a very severe execution, was obliged,
without any further gratuity, to vote for the candidate whom the
creditor recommended. In spite of all the laws against bribery and
corruption, the bounty of the candidates, together with the occasional
distributions of corn, which were ordered <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>417<span class="bracket">]</span></span> by the senate, were the principal funds from which, during the latter<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt690" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt690_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 times of the Roman republic, the poorer citizens derived their
subsistence. To deliver themselves from this subjection to their
creditors, the poorer citizens were continually calling out either for
an entire abolition of debts, or for what they called New Tables; that
is, for a law which should entitle them to a complete acquittance, upon
paying only a certain proportion of their accumulated debts. The law
which reduced the coin of all denominations to a sixth part of its
former value, as it enabled them to pay their debts with a sixth part of
 what they really owed, was equivalent to the most advantageous new
tables. In order to satisfy the people, the rich and the great were,
upon several different occasions, obliged to consent to laws both for
abolishing debts, and for introducing new tables; and they probably were
 induced to consent to this law, partly for the same reason, and partly
that, by liberating the public revenue, they might restore vigour to
that government of which they themselves had the principal direction. An
 operation of this kind would at once reduce a debt of a hundred and
twenty-eight millions to twenty-one millions three hundred and
thirty-three thousand three hundred and thirty-three pounds six
shillings and eight-pence. In the course of the second Punic war the As
was still further reduced, first, from two ounces of copper to one
ounce; and afterwards from one ounce to half an ounce; that is, to the
twenty-fourth part of its original value.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt691" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt691_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 By combining the three Roman operations into one, a debt of a hundred
and twenty-eight millions of our present money, might in this manner be
reduced all at once to a debt of five millions three hundred and
thirty-three thousand three hundred and thirty-three pounds six
shillings and eight-pence. Even the enormous debt of Great Britain might
 in this manner soon be paid.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_1014">By means of such expedients the coin of, I believe, all nations has<span class="type-margin"><span>and has led to the universal reduction of the value of the coin</span></span>
 been gradually reduced more and more below its original value, and the
same nominal sum has been gradually brought to contain a smaller and a
smaller quantity of silver.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_1015">Nations have sometimes, for the same purpose, adulterated the<span class="type-margin"><span>Another expedient is to adulterate the coin,</span></span>
 standard of their coin; that is, have mixed a greater quantity of alloy
 in it. If in the pound weight of our silver coin, for example, instead
of eighteen penny-weight, according to the present standard, there was
mixed eight ounces of alloy; a pound sterling, or twenty shillings of
such coin, would be worth little more than six shillings and eight-pence
 <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>418<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of our present money. The quantity of silver contained in six shillings
 and eight-pence of our present money, would thus be raised very nearly
to the denomination of a pound sterling. The adulteration of the
standard has exactly the same effect with what the French call an
augmentation, or a direct raising of the denomination of the coin.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_1016"><span class="type-margin"><span>but this is a treacherous fraud which occasions such indignation that it usually fails.</span></span>An
 augmentation, or a direct raising of the denomination of the coin,
always is, and from its nature must be, an open and avowed operation. By
 means of it pieces of a smaller weight and bulk are called by the same
name which had before been given to pieces of a greater weight and bulk.
 The adulteration of the standard, on the contrary, has generally been a
 concealed operation. By means of it pieces were issued from the mint of
 the same denominations, and, as nearly as could be contrived, of the
same weight, bulk, and appearance, with pieces which had been current
before of much greater value. When king John of France,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt692" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt692_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 in order to pay his debts, adulterated his coin, all the officers of
his mint were sworn to secrecy. Both operations are unjust. But a simple
 augmentation is an injustice of open violence; whereas an adulteration
is an injustice of treacherous fraud. This latter operation, therefore,
as soon as it has been discovered, and it could never be concealed very
long, has always excited much greater indignation than the former. The
coin after any considerable augmentation has very seldom been brought
back to its former weight; but after the greatest adulterations it has
almost always been brought back to its former fineness. It has scarce
ever happened that the fury and indignation of the people could
otherwise be appeased.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_1017"><span class="type-margin"><span>It has been tried in England, Scotland and most other countries.</span></span>In
 the end of the reign of Henry VIII. and in the beginning of that of
Edward VI. the English coin was not only raised in its denomination, but
 adulterated in its standard. The like frauds were practised in Scotland
 during the minority of James VI. They have occasionally been practised
in most other countries.</p>

ever be made towards that liberation, while the surplus of that revenue,
 or what is over and above defraying the annual expence of the peace

 and such alterations in the present system of customs and excise as
those which have been mentioned in the foregoing chapter, might,
perhaps, without increasing the burden of the greater part of the
people, but only distributing the weight of it more equally upon the
whole, produce a considerable augmentation of revenue. The most sanguine
 projector, however, could scarce flatter himself that any augmentation
of this kind would be such as could give any reasonable hopes, either of
 liberating the public revenue altogether, or even of making such
progress towards that liberation in time of peace, as either to prevent
or to compensate the further accumulation of the public debt in the next
 war.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_1020">By extending the British system of taxation to all the different<span class="type-margin"><span>An extension of taxation to Ireland and the colonies would afford a larger increase</span></span> provinces of the empire inhabited by people of either<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt694" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt694_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 British or European extraction, a much greater augmentation of revenue
might be expected. This, however, could scarce, perhaps, be done,
consistently with the principles of the British constitution, without
admitting into the British parliament, or if you will into the
states-general of the British empire, a fair and equal representation of
 all those different provinces, that of each province bearing the same
proportion to the produce of its taxes, as the representation of Great
Britain might bear to the produce of the taxes levied upon Great
Britain. The private interest of many powerful individuals, the
confirmed prejudices of great bodies of people seem, indeed, at present,
 to oppose to so great a change such obstacles as it may be very
difficult, perhaps altogether impossible, to surmount. Without, however,
 pretending to determine whether such a union be practicable or
impracticable, it may not, perhaps, be improper, in a speculative work
of this kind, to consider how far the British system of taxation might
be applicable to all the different provinces of the empire; what revenue
 might be expected from it if so applied, and in what manner a general
union of this kind might be likely to affect the happiness and
prosperity of the different provinces comprehended within it. Such a
speculation can at worst be regarded but as a new Utopia, less amusing
certainly, but not more useless and chimerical than the old one.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_1021">The land-tax, the stamp-duties, and the
different duties of customs and excise, constitute the four principal
branches of the British taxes.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>420<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_1022"><span class="type-margin"><span>The land-tax could well be extended to Ireland, America and the West Indies</span></span>Ireland
 is certainly as able, and our American and West Indian plantations more
 able to pay a land-tax than Great Britain. Where the landlord is
subject neither to tithe nor poors rate, he must certainly be more able
to pay such a tax, than where he is subject to both those other burdens.
 The tithe, where there is no modus, and where it is levied in kind,
diminishes more what would otherwise be the rent of the landlord, than a
 land-tax which really amounted to five shillings in the pound. Such a
tithe will be found in most cases to amount to more than a fourth part
of the real rent of the land, or of what remains after replacing
completely the capital of the farmer, together with his reasonable
profit. If all moduses and all impropriations were taken away, the
complete church tithe of Great Britain and Ireland could not well be
estimated at less than six or seven millions. If there was no tithe
either in Great Britain or Ireland, the landlords could afford to pay
six or seven millions additional land-tax, without being more burdened
than a very great part of them are at present. America pays no tithe,
and could therefore very well afford to pay a land-tax. The lands in
America and the West Indies, indeed, are in general not tenanted nor<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt695" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt695_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 leased out to farmers. They could not therefore be assessed according
to any rent-roll. But neither were the lands of Great Britain, in the
4th of William and Mary, assessed according to any rent-roll, but
according to a very loose and inaccurate estimation. The lands in
America might be assessed either in the same manner, or according to an
equitable valuation in consequence of an accurate survey, like that
which was lately made in the Milanese, and in the dominions of Austria,
Prussia, and Sardinia.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt696" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt696_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_1023"><span class="type-margin"><span>Stamp duties could easily be extended.</span></span>Stamp-duties,
 it is evident, might be levied without any variation in all countries
where the forms of law process, and the deeds by which property both
real and personal is transferred, are the same or nearly the same.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_1024"><span class="type-margin"><span>The extension of the customs would be of great advantage to all, as it would be accompanied by an extension of free trade.</span></span>The
 extension of the custom-house laws of Great Britain to Ireland and the
plantations, provided it was accompanied, as in justice it ought to be,
with an extension of the freedom of trade, would be in the highest
degree advantageous to both. All the invidious restraints which at
present oppress the trade of Ireland, the distinction between the
enumerated and non-enumerated commodities of America, would be entirely
at an end.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt697" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt697_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 The countries north of Cape Finisterre would be as open to every part
of the produce of America, as those south of that Cape are to some parts
 of that produce at present. The trade between all the different parts
of the British empire would, in consequence <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>421<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of this uniformity in the custom-house laws, be as free as the coasting
 trade of Great Britain is at present. The British empire would thus
afford within itself an immense internal market for every part of the
produce of all its different provinces. So great an extension of market
would soon compensate both to Ireland and the plantations, all that they
 could suffer from the increase of the duties of customs.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_1025">The excise is the only part of the British system of taxation, which<span class="type-margin"><span>Excise duties would require some variation,</span></span>
 would require to be varied in any respect according as it was applied
to the different provinces of the empire. It might be applied to Ireland
 without any variation; the produce and consumption of that kingdom
being exactly of the same nature with those of Great Britain. In its
application to America and the West Indies, of which the produce and
consumption are so very different from those of Great Britain, some
modification might be necessary, in the same manner as in its
application to the cyder and beer counties of England.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_1026">A fermented liquor, for example, which is called beer, but which,<span class="type-margin"><span>as for example in the case of American beer</span></span>
 as it is made of melasses, bears very little resemblance to our beer,
makes a considerable part of the common drink of the people in America.
This liquor, as it can be kept only for a few days, cannot, like our
beer, be prepared and stored up for sale in great breweries; but every
private family must brew it for their own use, in the same manner as
they cook their victuals. But to subject every private family to the
odious visits and examination of the tax-gatherers, in the same manner
as we subject the keepers of alehouses and the brewers for public sale,
would be altogether inconsistent with liberty. If for the sake of
equality it was thought necessary to lay a tax upon this liquor, it
might be taxed by taxing the material of which it is made, either at the
 place of manufacture, or, if the circumstances of the trade rendered
such an excise improper, by laying a duty upon its importation into the
colony in which it was to be consumed. Besides the duty of one penny a
gallon imposed by the British parliament upon the importation of
melasses into America; there is a provincial tax of this kind upon their
 importation into Massachusets Bay, in ships belonging to any other
colony, of eight-pence the hogshead; and another upon their importation,
 from the northern colonies, into South Carolina, of five-pence the
gallon. Or if neither of these methods was found convenient, each family
 might compound for its consumption of this liquor, either according to
the number of persons of which it consisted, in the same manner as
private families compound for the malt-tax in England; or according to
the different ages and sexes of those persons, in the same manner as
several different taxes are levied in <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>422<span class="bracket">]</span></span> Holland; or nearly as Sir Matthew Decker proposes that all taxes upon consumable commodities should be levied in England.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt698" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt698_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 This mode of taxation, it has already been observed, when applied to
objects of a speedy consumption, is not a very convenient one. It might
be adopted, however, in cases where no better could be done.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_1027"><span class="type-margin"><span>Sugar, rum and tobacco could be made subject to excise.</span></span>Sugar,
 rum, and tobacco, are commodities which are no where necessaries of
life, which are become objects of almost universal consumption, and
which are therefore extremely proper subjects of taxation. If a union
with the colonies were<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt699" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt699_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 to take place, those commodities might be taxed either before they go
out of the hands of the manufacturer or grower; or if this mode of
taxation did not suit the circumstances of those persons, they might be
deposited in public warehouses both at the place of manufacture, and at
all the different ports of the empire to which they might afterwards be
transported, to remain there, under the joint custody of the owner and
the revenue officer, till such time as they should be delivered out
either to the consumer, to the merchant retailer for home-consumption,
or to the merchant exporter, the tax not to be advanced till such
delivery. When delivered out for exportation, to go duty free; upon
proper security being given that they should really be exported out of
the empire. These are perhaps the principal commodities with regard to
which a union with the colonies might require some considerable change
in the present system of British taxation.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_1028"><span class="type-margin"><span>The increase
of revenue thus obtained, if proportionate to the increased population
taxed, would yield six millions and a quarter to be applied in reduction
 of debt, and this sum would of course be a growing one</span></span>What
 might be the amount of the revenue which this system of taxation
extended to all the different provinces of the empire might produce, it
must, no doubt, be altogether impossible to ascertain with tolerable
exactness. By means of this system there is annually levied in Great
Britain, upon less than eight millions of people, more than ten millions
 of revenue. Ireland contains more than two millions of people, and
according to the accounts laid before the congress,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt700" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt700_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 the twelve associated provinces of America contain more than three.
Those accounts, however, may have been exaggerated, in order, perhaps,
either to encourage their own people, or to intimidate those of this
country, and we shall suppose therefore that our North American and West
 Indian colonies taken together contain no more than three millions; or
that the whole British empire, in Europe and America, contains no more
than thirteen millions of inhabitants. If upon less than eight millions
of inhabitants this system of taxation <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>423<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 raises a revenue of more than ten millions sterling; it ought upon
thirteen millions of inhabitants to raise a revenue of more than sixteen
 millions two hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling. From this
revenue, supposing that this system could produce it, must be deducted,
the revenue usually raised in Ireland and the plantations for defraying
the expence of their respective civil governments. The expence of the
civil and military establishment of Ireland, together with the interest
of the public debt, amounts, at a medium of the two years which ended
March 1775, to something less than seven hundred and fifty thousand
pounds a year. By a very exact account<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt701" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt701_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> of the revenue of the principal colonies of America and the West Indies, it amounted, before the commencement of the present<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt702" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt702_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 disturbances, to a hundred and forty-one thousand eight hundred pounds.
 In this account, however, the revenue of Maryland, of North Carolina,
and of all our late acquisitions both upon the continent and in the
islands, is omitted, which may perhaps make a difference of thirty or
forty thousand pounds. For the sake of even numbers therefore, let us
suppose that the revenue necessary for supporting the civil government
of Ireland and the plantations, may amount to a million. There would
remain consequently a revenue of fifteen millions two hundred and fifty
thousand pounds, to be applied towards defraying the general expence of
the empire, and towards paying the public debt. But if from the present
revenue of Great Britain a million could in peaceable times be spared
towards the payment of that debt, six millions two hundred and fifty
thousand pounds could very well be spared from this improved revenue.
This great sinking fund too might be augmented every year by the
interest of the debt which had been discharged the year before, and
might in this manner increase so very rapidly, as to be sufficient in a
few years to discharge the whole debt, and thus to restore completely
the at present debilitated and languishing vigour of the empire. In the
mean time the people might be relieved from some of the most burdensome
taxes; from those which are imposed either upon the necessaries of life,
 or upon the materials of manufacture. The labouring poor would thus be
enabled to live better, to work cheaper, and to send their goods cheaper
 to market. The cheapness of their goods would increase the demand for
them, and consequently for the labour of those who produced them. This
increase in the demand for labour, would both increase the numbers and
improve the circumstances of the labouring poor. Their consumption would
 increase, and together with it the revenue arising <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>424<span class="bracket">]</span></span> from all those articles of their consumption upon which the taxes might be allowed to remain.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_1029"><span class="type-margin"><span>Some necessary deductions from this estimate would be counterbalanced by additions resulting from a few simple alterations.</span></span>The
 revenue arising from this system of taxation, however, might not
immediately increase in proportion to the number of people who were
subjected to it. Great indulgence would for some time be due to those
provinces of the empire which were thus subjected to burthens to which
they had not before been accustomed, and even when the same taxes came
to be levied every where as exactly as possible, they would not every
where produce a revenue proportioned to the numbers of the people. In a
poor country the consumption of the principal commodities subject to the
 duties of customs and excise is very small; and in a thinly inhabited
country the opportunities of smuggling are very great. The consumption
of malt liquors among the inferior ranks of people in Scotland is very
small, and the excise upon malt, beer, and ale, produces less there than
 in England in proportion to the numbers of the people and the rate of
the duties, which upon malt is different on account of a supposed
difference of quality. In these particular branches of the excise, there
 is not, I apprehend, much more smuggling in the one country than in the
 other. The duties upon the distillery, and the greater part of the
duties of customs, in proportion to the numbers of people in the
respective countries, produce less in Scotland than in England, not only
 on account of the smaller consumption of the taxed commodities, but of
the much greater facility of smuggling. In Ireland, the inferior ranks
of people are still poorer than in Scotland, and many parts of the
country are almost as thinly inhabited. In Ireland, therefore, the
consumption of the taxed commodities might, in proportion to the number
of the people, be still less than in Scotland, and the facility of
smuggling nearly the same. In America and the West Indies the white
people even of the lowest rank are in much better circumstances than
those of the same rank in England, and their consumption of all the
luxuries in which they usually indulge themselves is probably much
greater. The blacks, indeed, who make the greater part of the
inhabitants both of the southern colonies upon the continent and of the
West India<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt703" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt703_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 islands, as they are in a state of slavery, are, no doubt, in a worse
condition than the poorest people either in Scotland or Ireland. We must
 not, however, upon that account, imagine that they are worse fed, or
that their consumption of articles which might be subjected to moderate
duties, is less than that even of the lower ranks of people in England.
In order that they may work well, it is the interest of their master
that they should be fed well and kept in good heart, in the same manner
as it is his interest <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>425<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 that his working cattle should be so. The blacks accordingly have
almost every where their allowance of rum and of melasses or spruce
beer, in the same manner as the white servants; and this allowance would
 not probably be withdrawn, though those articles should be subjected to
 moderate duties. The consumption of the taxed commodities, therefore,
in proportion to the number of inhabitants, would probably be as great
in America and the West Indies as in any part of the British empire. The
 opportunities of smuggling indeed, would be much greater; America, in
proportion to the extent of the country, being much more thinly
inhabited than either Scotland or Ireland. If the revenue, however,
which is at present raised by the different duties upon malt and malt
liquors, were<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt704" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt704_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 to be levied by a single duty upon malt, the opportunity of smuggling
in the most important branch of the excise would be almost entirely
taken away: And if the duties of customs, instead of being imposed upon
almost all the different articles of importation, were confined to a few
 of the most general use and consumption, and if the levying of those
duties were subjected to the excise laws, the opportunity of smuggling,
though not so entirely taken away, would be very much diminished. In
consequence of those two, apparently, very simple and easy alterations,
the duties of customs and excise might probably produce a revenue as
great in proportion to the consumption of the most thinly inhabited
province, as they do at present in proportion to that of the most
populous.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_1030">The Americans, it has been said, indeed, have no gold or silver<span class="type-margin"><span>The Americans have little gold and silver</span></span>
 money; the interior commerce of the country being carried on by a paper

being all sent to Great Britain in return for the commodities which they
 receive from us. But without gold and silver, it is added, there is no
possibility of paying taxes. We already get all the gold and silver
which they have. How is it possible to draw from them what they have
not?</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_1031">The present scarcity of gold and silver money in America is not the<span class="type-margin"><span>but this is the effect of choice, not necessity.</span></span>
 effect of the poverty of that country, or of the inability of the
people there to purchase those metals. In a country where the wages of
labour are so much higher, and the price of provisions so much lower
than in England, the greater part of the people must surely have
wherewithal to purchase a greater quantity, if it were<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt705" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt705_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 either necessary or convenient for them to do so. The scarcity of those

 may, at least in peaceable times, be transacted by means of a paper
currency, with nearly the same degree of conveniency as by gold and
silver money. It is convenient for the Americans, who could always
employ with profit in the improvement of their lands a greater stock
than they can easily get, to save as much as possible the expence of so
costly an instrument of commerce as gold and silver, and rather to
employ that part of their surplus produce which would be necessary for
purchasing those metals, in purchasing the instruments of trade, the
materials of clothing, several parts of household furniture, and the
iron-work necessary for building and extending their settlements and
plantations; in purchasing, not dead stock, but active and productive
stock. The colony governments find it for their interest to supply the<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt707" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt707_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 people with such a quantity of paper-money as is fully sufficient and
generally more than sufficient for transacting their domestic business.
Some of those governments, that of Pennsylvania particularly, derive a
revenue from lending this paper-money to their subjects at an interest
of so much per cent. Others, like that of Massachusett’s Bay, advance
upon extraordinary emergencies a paper-money of this kind for defraying
the public expence, and afterwards, when it suits the conveniency of the
 colony, redeem it at the depreciated value to which it gradually falls.
 In 1747<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt708" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt708_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 that colony paid, in this manner, the greater part of its public debts,
 with the tenth part of the money for which its bills had been granted.
It suits the conveniency of the planters to save the expence of
employing gold and silver money in their domestic transactions; and it
suits the conveniency of the colony governments to supply them with a
medium, which, though attended with some very considerable
disadvantages, enables them to save that expence. The redundancy of
paper-money necessarily banishes gold and silver from the domestic
transactions of the colonies, for the same reason that it has banished
those metals from the greater part of the domestic transactions in<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt709" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt709_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 Scotland; and in both countries it is not the poverty, but the
enterprizing and projecting spirit of the people, their desire of
employing all the stock which they can get as active and productive
stock, which has occasioned this redundancy of paper-money.</p>

<p id="Smith_0206-02_1034">In the exterior commerce which the different colonies carry on with<span class="type-margin"><span>while for their external trade they use as much gold and silver as is necessary.</span></span>
 Great Britain, gold and silver are more or less employed, exactly in
proportion as they are more or less necessary. Where those metals are
not necessary, they seldom appear. Where they are necessary, they are
generally found.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_1035"><span class="type-margin"><span>In the trade between Great Britain and Virginia and Maryland tobacco is a more convenient currency than gold and silver.</span></span>In
 the commerce between Great Britain and the tobacco colonies, the
British goods are generally advanced to the colonists at a pretty long
credit, and are afterwards paid for in tobacco, rated at a certain
price. It is more convenient for the colonists to pay in tobacco than in
 gold and silver. It would be more convenient for any merchant to pay
for the goods which his correspondents had sold to him in some other
sort of goods which he might happen to deal in, than in money. Such a
merchant would have no occasion to keep any part of his stock by him
unemployed, and in ready money, for answering occasional demands. He
could have, at all times, a larger quantity of goods in his shop or
warehouse, and he could deal to a greater extent. But it seldom happens
to be convenient for all the correspondents of a merchant to receive
payment for the goods which they sell to him, in goods of some other
kind which he happens to deal in. The British merchants who trade to
Virginia and Maryland happen to be a particular set of correspondents,
to whom it is more convenient to receive payment for the goods which
they sell to those colonies in tobacco than in gold and silver. They
expect to make a profit by the sale of the tobacco. They could make none
 by that of the gold and silver. Gold and silver, therefore, very seldom
 appear in the commerce between Great Britain and the tobacco colonies.
Maryland and Virginia have as little occasion for those metals in their
foreign as in their domestic commerce. They are said, accordingly, to
have less gold and silver money than any other colonies in America. They
 are reckoned, however, as thriving, and consequently as rich, as any of
 their neighbours.</p>

 send out every year a very large balance in money, and the trade to the
 West Indies would, by a certain species of politicians, be considered
as extremely disadvantageous. But it so happens, that many of the
principal proprietors of the sugar plantations reside in Great Britain.
Their rents are remitted to them in sugar and rum, the produce of their
estates. The sugar and rum which the West India merchants purchase in
those colonies upon their own account, are not equal in value to the
goods which they annually sell there. A balance therefore must

from our different sugar colonies has been greater or less in
proportion, not so much to the extent of the balances respectively due
from them, as to the quantity of uncultivated land which they contained;
 that is, to the greater or smaller temptation which the planters have
been under of over-trading, or of undertaking the settlement and
plantation of greater quantities of waste land than suited the extent of
 their capitals. The returns from the great island of Jamaica, where
there is still much uncultivated land, have, upon this account, been in
general more irregular and uncertain, than those from the smaller
islands of Barbadoes, Antigua, and St. Christophers, which have for
these many years been completely cultivated, and have, upon that
account, afforded less field for the speculations of the planter. The
new acquisitions of Grenada, Tobago, St. Vincents, and Dominica,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt712" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt712_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 have opened a new field for speculations of this kind; and the returns
from those islands have of late been as irregular and uncertain as those
 from the great island of Jamaica.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_1039"><span class="type-margin"><span>and have arisen from unnecessary and excessive enterprise</span></span>It
 is not, therefore, the poverty of the colonies which occasions, in the
greater part of them, the present scarcity of gold and silver money.
Their great demand for active and productive stock makes it convenient
for them to have as little dead stock as possible; and disposes them
upon that account to content themselves with a cheaper, though less
commodious instrument of commerce than gold and silver. They are thereby
 enabled to convert the value of that gold and silver into the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>429<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 instruments of trade, into the materials of clothing, into household
furniture, and into the iron work necessary for building and extending
their settlements and plantations. In those branches of business which
cannot be transacted without gold and silver money, it appears, that
they can always find the necessary quantity of those metals; and if they
 frequently do not find it, their failure is generally the effect, not
of their necessary poverty, but of their unnecessary and excessive
enterprize. It is not because they are poor that their payments are
irregular and uncertain; but because they are too eager to become
excessively rich. Though all that part of the produce of the colony
taxes, which was over and above what was necessary for defraying the
expence of their own civil and military establishments, were to be
remitted to Great Britain in gold and silver, the colonies have
abundantly wherewithal to purchase the requisite quantity of those
metals. They would in this case be obliged, indeed, to exchange a part
of their surplus produce, with which they now purchase active and
productive stock, for dead stock. In transacting their domestic business
 they would be obliged to employ a costly instead of a cheap instrument
of commerce; and the expence of purchasing this costly instrument might
damp somewhat the vivacity and ardour of their excessive enterprize in
the improvement of land. It might not, however, be necessary to remit
any part of the American revenue in gold and silver. It might be
remitted in bills drawn upon and accepted by particular merchants or
companies in Great Britain, to whom a part of the surplus produce of
America had been consigned, who would pay into the treasury the American
 revenue in money, after having themselves received the value of it in
goods; and the whole business might frequently be transacted without
exporting a single ounce of gold or silver<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt713" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt713_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> from America.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_1040">It is not contrary to justice that both Ireland and America should<span class="type-margin"><span>It is Justice that Ireland and America should contribute to the discharge of the British debt</span></span>
 contribute towards the discharge of the public debt of Great Britain.
That debt has been contracted in support of the government established
by the Revolution, a government to which the protestants of Ireland owe,
 not only the whole authority which they at present enjoy in their own
country, but every security which they possess for their liberty, their
property, and their religion; a government to which several of the
colonies of America owe their present charters, and consequently their
present constitution, and to which all the colonies of America owe the
liberty, security, and property which they have ever since enjoyed. That
 public debt has been contracted in the defence, not of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>430<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 Great Britain alone, but of all the different provinces of the empire;
the immense debt contracted in the late war in particular, and a great
part of that contracted in the war before, were both properly contracted
 in defence of America.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_1041"><span class="type-margin"><span>Union would deliver Ireland from an oppressive aristocracy founded on religious and political prejudices</span></span>By
 a union with Great Britain, Ireland would gain, besides the freedom of
trade, other advantages much more important, and which would much more
than compensate any increase of taxes that might accompany that union.
By the union with England, the middling and inferior ranks of people in
Scotland gained a complete deliverance from the power of an aristocracy
which had always before oppressed them. By an union with Great Britain,
the greater part of the people of all ranks in Ireland would gain an
equally complete deliverance from a much more oppressive aristocracy; an
 aristocracy not founded, like that of Scotland, in the natural and
respectable distinctions of birth and fortune; but in the most odious of
 all distinctions, those of religious and political prejudices;
distinctions which, more than any other, animate both the insolence of
the oppressors and the hatred and indignation of the oppressed, and
which commonly render the inhabitants of the same country more hostile
to one another than those of different countries ever are. Without a
union with Great Britain, the inhabitants of Ireland are not likely for
many ages to consider themselves as one people.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_1042"><span class="type-margin"><span>The colonies
would be delivered from rancorous factions which are likely to lead to
bloodshed in case of separation from Great Britain.</span></span>No
oppressive aristocracy has ever prevailed in the colonies. Even they,
however, would, in point of happiness and tranquillity, gain
considerably by a union with Great Britain. It would, at least, deliver
them from those rancorous and virulent factions which are inseparable
from small democracies, and which have so frequently divided the
affections of their people, and disturbed the tranquillity of their
governments, in their form so nearly democratical. In the case of a
total separation from Great Britain, which, unless prevented by a union
of this kind, seems very likely to take place, those factions would be
ten times more virulent than ever. Before the commencement of the
present disturbances, the coercive power of the mother-country had
always been able to restrain those factions from breaking out into any
thing worse than gross brutality and insult. If that coercive power were<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt714" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt714_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 entirely taken away, they would probably soon break out into open
violence and bloodshed. In all great countries which are united under
one uniform government, the spirit of party commonly prevails less in
the remote provinces than in the centre of the empire. The distance of
those provinces from the capital, from the principal seat of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>431<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 the great scramble of faction and ambition, makes them enter less into
the views of any of the contending parties, and renders them more
indifferent and impartial spectators of the conduct of all. The spirit
of party prevails less in Scotland than in England. In the case of a
union it would probably prevail less in Ireland than in Scotland, and
the colonies would probably soon enjoy a degree of concord and unanimity
 at present unknown in any part of the British empire. Both Ireland and
the colonies, indeed, would be subjected to heavier taxes than any which
 they at present pay. In consequence, however, of a diligent and
faithful application of the public revenue towards the discharge of the
national debt, the greater part of those taxes might not be of long
continuance, and the public revenue of Great Britain might soon be
reduced to what was necessary for maintaining a moderate peace
establishment.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_1043">The territorial acquisitions of the East India company, the undoubted<span class="type-margin"><span>East India with lighter taxes and less corrupt administration might yield an even larger addition of revenue.</span></span>
 right of the crown, that is, of the state and people of Great Britain,
might be rendered another source of revenue more abundant, perhaps, than
 all those already mentioned. Those countries are represented as more
fertile, more extensive; and, in proportion to their extent, much richer
 and more populous than Great Britain. In order to draw a great revenue
from them, it would not probably be necessary, to introduce any new
system of taxation into countries which are already sufficiently and
more than sufficiently taxed. It might, perhaps, be more proper to
lighten, than to aggravate, the burden of those unfortunate countries,
and to endeavour to draw a revenue from them, not by imposing new taxes,
 but by preventing the embezzlement and misapplication of the greater
part of those which they already pay.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_1044">If it should be found impracticable for Great Britain to draw any<span class="type-margin"><span>If
 no such augmentation of revenue can be obtained Great Britain should
reduce her expenses by ridding herself of the cost of the colonies in
peace and war</span></span> considerable augmentation of revenue from
any of the resources above mentioned; the only resource which can remain
 to her is a diminution of her expence. In the mode of collecting, and
in that of expending the public revenue; though in both there may be
still room for improvement; Great Britain seems to be at least as
œconomical as any of her neighbours. The military establishment which
she maintains for her own defence in time of peace, is more moderate
than that of any European state which can pretend to rival her either in
 wealth or in power. None of those articles, therefore, seem to admit of
 any considerable reduction of expence. The expence of the peace
establishment of the colonies was, before the commencement of the
present disturbances, very considerable, and is an expence which may,
and if no revenue can be drawn from them, ought certainly to be saved <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>432<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 altogether. This constant expence in time of peace, though very great,
is insignificant in comparison with what the defence of the colonies has
 cost us in time of war. The last war, which was undertaken altogether
on account of the colonies, cost Great Britain, it has already been
observed, upwards of ninety millions.<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt715" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt715_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The Spanish war of 1739 was principally undertaken on their account; in
 which, and in the French war that was the consequence of it, Great
Britain spent upwards of forty millions, a great part of which ought
justly to be charged to the colonies. In those two wars the colonies
cost Great Britain much more than double the sum which the national debt
 amounted to before the commencement of the first of them. Had it not
been for those wars that debt might, and probably would by this time,
have been completely paid; and had it not been for the colonies, the
former of those wars might not, and the latter certainly would not have
been undertaken. It was because the colonies were supposed to be
provinces of the British empire, that this expence was laid out upon
them. But countries which contribute neither revenue nor military force
towards the support of the empire, cannot be considered as provinces.
They may perhaps be considered as appendages, as a sort of splendid and
showy equipage of the empire. But if the empire can no longer support
the expence of keeping up this equipage, it ought certainly to lay it
down; and if it cannot raise its revenue in proportion to its expence,
it ought, at least, to accommodate its expence to its revenue. If the
colonies, notwithstanding their refusal to submit to British taxes, are
still to be considered as provinces of the British empire, their defence
 in some future war may cost Great Britain as great an expence as it
ever has done in any former war. The rulers of Great Britain have, for
more than a century past, amused the people with the imagination that
they possessed a great empire on the west side of the Atlantic. This
empire, however, has hitherto existed in imagination only. It has
hitherto been, not an empire, but the project of an empire; not a gold
mine, but the project of a gold mine; a project which has cost, which
continues to cost, and which, if pursued in the same way as it has been
hitherto, is likely to cost, immense expence, without being likely to
bring any profit; for the effects of the monopoly of the colony trade,
it has been shewn,<a href="#lf0206-02_footnote_nt716" id="lf0206-02_footnote_nt716_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 are, to the great body of the people, mere loss instead of profit. It
is surely now time that our rulers should either realize this golden
dream, in which they have been indulging themselves, perhaps, as well as
 the people; or, that they should awake from it themselves, and
endeavour <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>433<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 to awaken the people. If the project cannot be completed, it ought to
be given up. If any of the provinces of the British empire cannot be
made to contribute towards the support of the whole empire, it is surely
 time that Great Britain should free herself from the expence of
defending those provinces in time of war, and of supporting any part of
their civil or military establishments in time of peace, and endeavour
to accommodate her future views and designs to the real mediocrity of
her circumstances.</p>

necessary for its defence; and if these cannot otherwise be maintained
at home, it is reasonable that all other branches of industry should be
taxed in order to support them. The bounties upon the importation of
naval stores from America, upon British made sail-cloth, and upon
British made gunpowder, may perhaps all three be vindicated upon this

<p id="Smith_0206-02_1138">These different duties were imposed, partly
by the 22d of Charles II. in place of the Old Subsidy, partly by the New
 Subsidy, by the One-third and Two-thirds Subsidy, and by the Subsidy
1747. [The table of duties in this note is an exact copy of that in
Charles Smith, <span class="ital">Three Tracts on the Corn Trade,</span> 2nd ed., 1766, p. 83. That author professes to have taken the figures from ‘Mr. Saxby, in his Book of Rates’ (<span class="ital">i.e.,</span> Henry Saxby, <span class="ital">The British Customs, containing an Historical and Practical Account of each branch of that Revenue,</span>
 1757, pp. 111-114), but besides rounding off Saxby’s fractions of a
penny in an inaccurate and inconsistent manner, he has miscopied the
second duty on barley, the first on pease and the third on wheat. The
‘Old Subsidy’ consisted of the 5 per cent. or 1s. poundage imposed by 12
 Car. II., c. 4, on the values attributed to the various goods by the
‘Book of Rates’ annexed to the Act. According to this, imported beans,
barley and malt were to be rated at 26s. 8d. the quarter when the actual
 price at the place of importation did not exceed 28s. When the actual
price was higher than that they were to be rated at 5s. the quarter.
Oats and pease were to be rated at 4s. the quarter. Rye when not over
36s. was to be rated at 26s. 8d., and when over that price at 5s. Wheat
when not over 44s. was to be rated at 40s., and when over that price at
6s. 8d.</p><p id="Smith_0206-02_1139">So under the Old Subsidy:—</p>
<div class="cit">
<p id="Smith_0206-02_1140">Beans, barley and malt at prices up to 28s. were to pay 1s. 4d., and when above that price 3d.</p><p id="Smith_0206-02_1141">Oats and pease to pay 2·4d.</p><p id="Smith_0206-02_1142">Rye up to 36s. to pay 1s. 4d., and when above, 3d.</p><p id="Smith_0206-02_1143">Wheat up to 44s. to pay 2s., and when above, 4d.</p>
</div>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_1144">The Act 22 Car. II., c. 13, took off these duties and substituted the following scheme:—</p>

<p id="Smith_0206-02_1145">Beans to 40s. to pay 16s., and above that price, 3d.</p><p id="Smith_0206-02_1146">Barley and malt to 32s. to pay 16s., and above, 3d.</p><p id="Smith_0206-02_1147">Oats to 16s. to pay 5s. 4d., and above, 2·4d.</p><p id="Smith_0206-02_1148">Pease and rye the same as beans.</p><p id="Smith_0206-02_1149">Wheat to 53s. 4d. to pay 16s., then to 80s. to pay 8s., and above that price, 4d.</p><p id="Smith_0206-02_1150">Buckwheat to 32s. to pay 16s.</p>
</div>
<p id="Smith_0206-02_1151">But 9 and 10 Will. III., c. 23, imposed a
‘New Subsidy’ exactly equal to the Old, so that duties equal to those of
 12 Car. II., c. 4, were superimposed on those of 22 Car. II., c. 13. By
 2 and 3 Ann., c. 9, an additional third, and by 3 and 4 Ann., c. 5, an
additional two-thirds of the Old Subsidy were imposed, and by 21 Geo.
II., c. 2, another amount equal to the Old Subsidy (‘the impost 1747’)
was further imposed. So between 1747 and 1773 the duties were those of
22 Car. II., c. 13, <span class="ital">plus</span> three times those of 12 Car. II., c. 4. This gives the following scheme:—</p>

described on the title page as ‘de la compagnie de Jésus, supérieur des

would bear out the text: ‘On cherchait une vallée ou un territoire dont

 interest of every proprietor of India Stock, however, is by no means
the same with that of the country in the government of which his vote
gives him some influence. See Book V. Chap. i. Part 3d. [This note
appears first in ed. 3, ed. 2 has the following note: ‘This would be
exactly true if those masters never had any other interest but that
which belongs to them as Proprietors of India stock. But they frequently
 have another of much greater importance. Frequently a man of great,
sometimes even a man of moderate fortune, is willing to give thirteen or
 fourteen hundred pounds (the present price of a thousand pounds share
in India stock) merely for the influence which he expects to acquire by a
 vote in the Court of Proprietors. It gives him a share, though not in
the plunder, yet in the appointment of the plunderers of India; the
Directors, though they make those appointments, being necessarily more
or less under the influence of the Court of Proprietors, which not only
elects them, but sometimes over-rules their appointments. A man of great
 or even a man of moderate fortune, provided he can enjoy this influence
 for a few years, and thereby get a certain number of his friends
appointed to employments in India, frequently cares little about the
dividend which he can expect from so small a capital, or even about the
improvement or loss of the capital itself upon which his vote is
founded. About the prosperity or ruin of the great empire, in the
government of which that vote gives him a share, he seldom cares at all.
 No other sovereigns ever were, or from the nature of things ever could
be, so perfectly indifferent about the happiness or misery of their
subjects, the improvement or waste of their dominions, the glory or
disgrace of their administration, as, from irresistible moral causes,
the greater part of the Proprietors of such a mercantile Company are,
and necessarily must be.’ This matter with some slight alterations
reappears in the portion of bk. v., chap. i., part iii., art. 1st, which
 was added in ed. 3 below, p. 243.]</p></div>

 attributes the saying to an unnamed commissioner of customs. ‘I will
tell you a secret, which I learned many years ago from the commissioners
 of the customs in London: they said when any commodity appeared to be
taxed above a moderate rate, the consequence was to lessen that branch
of the revenue by one-half; and one of these gentlemen pleasantly told
me that the mistake of parliaments on such occasions was owing to an
error of computing two and two make four; whereas in the business of
laying impositions, two and two never made more than one; which happens
by lessening the import, and the strong temptation of running such goods
 as paid high duties, at least in this kingdom.’—‘Answer to a Paper

 ed. Sir Charles Whitworth, 1771, vol. i., pp. 222, 223. But Davenant
does not confine the effect of the existing tax to the maltster, the
brewer and the retailer. The tax, he says, ‘which seems to be upon malt,
 does not lie all upon that commodity, as is vulgarly thought. For a
great many different persons contribute to the payment of this duty,
before it comes into the Exchequer. First, the landlord, because of the
excise, is forced to let his barley land at a lower rate; and, upon the
same score, the tenant must sell his barley at a less price; then the
maltster bears his share, for because of the duty, he must abate
something in the price of his malt, or keep it; in a proportion it
likewise affects the hop merchant, the cooper, the collier, and all
trades that have relation to the commodity. The retailers and brewers
bear likewise a great share, whose gains of necessity will be less,
because of that imposition; and, lastly, it comes heaviest of all upon
the consumers.’ If the duty were put upon the maltster, it would be
‘difficult for him to raise the price of a dear commodity a full ⅓d. at
once: so that he must bear the greatest part of the burden himself, or
throw it upon the farmer, by giving less for barley, which brings the
tax directly upon the land of England.’]</p></div>
