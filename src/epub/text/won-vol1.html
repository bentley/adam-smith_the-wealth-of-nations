<h2 id="lf0206-01_head_001">PREFACE</h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-01_2">THE text of the present
edition is copied from that of the fifth, the last published before Adam
 Smith’s death. The fifth edition has been carefully collated with the
first, and wherever the two were found to disagree the history of the
alteration has been traced through the intermediate editions. With some
half-dozen utterly insignificant exceptions such as a change of ‘these’
to ‘those,’ ‘towards’ to ‘toward,’ and several haphazard substitutions
of ‘conveniences’ for ‘conveniencies,’ the results of this collation are
 all recorded in the footnotes, unless the difference between the
editions is quite obviously and undoubtedly the consequence of mere
misprints, such as ‘is’ for ‘it,’ ‘that’ for ‘than,’ ‘becase’ for
‘because’. Even undoubted misprints are recorded if, as often happens,
they make a plausible misreading which has been copied in modern texts,
or if they present any other feature of interest.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_3">As it does not seem desirable to dress up an
eighteenth century classic entirely in twentieth century costume, I have
 retained the spelling of the fifth edition and steadily refused to
attempt to make it consistent with itself. The danger which would be
incurred by doing so may be shown by the example of ‘Cromwel’. Few
modern readers would hesitate to condemn this as a misprint, but it is,
as a matter of fact, the spelling affected by Hume in his <span class="ital">History,</span>
 and was doubtless adopted from him by Adam Smith, though in the second
of the two places where the name is mentioned inadvertence or the
obstinacy of the printers allowed the usual ‘Cromwell’ to appear till
the fourth edition was reached. I have been equally rigid in following
the original in the matter of the use of capitals and italics, except
that in deference to modern fashion I have allowed the initial words of
paragraphs to appear <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>vi<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 in small letters instead of capitals, the chapter headings to be
printed in capitals instead of italics, and the abbreviation ‘Chap.’ to
be replaced by ‘Chapter’ in full. I have also allowed each chapter to
begin on a fresh page, as the old practice of beginning a new chapter
below the end of the preceding one is inconvenient to a student who
desires to use the book for reference. The useless headline, ‘The Nature
 and Causes of the Wealth of Nations,’ which appears at the top of every
 pair of pages in the original, has been replaced by a headline which
changes with every chapter and, where possible, with every formal
subdivision of a chapter, so that the reader who opens the book in the
middle of a long chapter with several subdivisions may discover where he
 is immediately. The composition of these headlines has not always been
an easy matter, and I hope that critics who are inclined to condemn any
of them will take into account the smallness of the space available.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_4">The numbers of the Book and Chapter given in the
 margin of the original are relegated, with the very necessary addition
of the number of the Part of the chapter (if it is divided into numbered
 parts), to the top of the page in order to make room for a marginal
summary of the text. In writing this summary I have felt like an
architect commissioned to place a new building alongside some ancient
masterpiece: I have endeavoured to avoid on the one hand an impertinent
adoption of Smith’s words and style, and on the other an obtrusively
modern phraseology which might contrast unpleasantly with the text.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_5">The original index, with some slight unavoidable
 changes of typography, is reprinted as it appeared in the third, fourth
 and fifth editions, but I have added to it, in square brackets, a large
 number of new articles and references. I have endeavoured by these
additions to make it absolutely complete in regard to names of places
and persons, except that it seemed useless to include the names of kings
 and others when used merely to indicate dates, and altogether vain to
hope to deal comprehensively with ‘Asia,’ ‘England,’ ‘Great Britain’ and
 ‘Europe’. I have inserted a few catchwords which may aid in the
recovery of particularly striking passages, such as ‘Invisible hand,’
‘Pots and pans,’ ‘Retaliation,’ ‘Shopkeepers, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>vii<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 nation of’. I have not thought it desirable to add to the more general
of the headings in the original index, such as ‘Commerce’ and ‘Labour,’
since these might easily be enlarged till they included nearly
everything in the book. Authorities expressly referred to either in the
text or the Author’s notes are included, but as it would have been
inconvenient and confusing to add references to the Editor’s notes, I
have appended a second index in which all the authorities referred to in
 the text, in the Author’s notes, and in the Editor’s notes are
collected together. This will, I hope, be found useful by students of
the history of economics.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_6">The Author’s references to his footnotes are
placed exactly where he placed them, though their situation is often
somewhat curiously selected, and the footnotes themselves are printed
exactly as in the fifth edition. The Editor’s notes and additions to
Smith’s notes are in square brackets. Critics will probably complain of
the trivial character of many of the notes which record the result of
the collation of the editions, but I would point out that if I had not
recorded all the differences, readers would have had to rely entirely on
 my expression of opinion that the unrecorded differences were of no
interest. The evidence having been once collected at the expense of very
 considerable labour, it was surely better to put it on record,
especially as these trivial notes, though numerous, if collected
together would not occupy more than three or four pages of the present
work. Moreover, as is shown in the Editor’s Introduction, the most
trivial of the differences often throw interesting light upon Smith’s
way of regarding and treating his work.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_7">The other notes consist chiefly of references to
 sources of Adam Smith’s information. Where he quotes his authority by
name, no difficulty ordinarily arises. Elsewhere there is often little
doubt about the matter. The search for authorities has been greatly
facilitated by the publication of Dr. Bonar’s <span class="ital">Catalogue of the Library of Adam Smith</span> in 1894, and of Adam Smith’s <span class="ital">Lectures</span> in 1896. The <span class="ital">Catalogue</span> tells us what books Smith had in his possession at his death, fourteen years after the <span class="ital">Wealth of Nations</span> was published, while the <span class="ital">Lectures</span>
 often enable us to say that a particular piece of information must have
 been taken from a book published before 1763. As it is known that Smith
 used the Advocates’ <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>viii<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 Library, the Catalogue of that library, of which Part II, was printed
in 1776, has also been of some use. Of course a careful comparison of
words and phrases often makes it certain that a particular statement
must have come from a particular source. Nevertheless many of the
references given must be regarded as indicating merely a possible source
 of information or inspiration. I have refrained from quoting or
referring to parallel passages in other authors when it is impossible or
 improbable that Smith ever saw them. That many more references might be
 given by an editor gifted with omniscience I know better than any one.
To discover a reference has often taken hours of labour: to fail to
discover one has often taken days.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_8">When Adam Smith misquotes or clearly
misinterprets his authority, I note the fact, but I do not ordinarily
profess to decide whether his authority is right or wrong. It is neither
 possible nor desirable to rewrite the history of nearly all economic
institutions and a great many other institutions in the form of
footnotes to the <span class="ital">Wealth of Nations.</span></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_9">Nor have I thought well to criticise Adam
Smith’s theories in the light of modern discussions. I would beseech any
 one who thinks that this ought to have been done to consider seriously
what it would mean. Let him review the numerous portly volumes which
modern inquiry has produced upon every one of the immense number of
subjects treated by Adam Smith, and ask himself whether he really thinks
 the order of subjects in the <span class="ital">Wealth of Nations</span>
 a convenient one to adopt in an economic encyclopædia. The book is
surely a classic of great historical interest which should not be
overlaid by the opinions and criticisms of any subsequent moment—still
less of any particular editor.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_10">Much of the heavier work involved in preparing
the present edition, especially the collation of the original editions,
has been done by my friend Mrs. Norman Moor, without whose untiring
assistance the book could not have been produced.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_11">Numerous friends have given me the benefit of their knowledge of particular points, and my hearty thanks are due to them.</p>

<h2 id="lf0206-01_head_002">EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-01_64">THE first edition of the <span class="ital">Wealth of Nations</span> was published on the 9th of March,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt002" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt002_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 1776, in two volumes quarto, of which the first, containing Books I.,
II. and III., has 510 pages of text, and the second, containing Books
IV. and V., has 587. The title-page describes the author as ‘Adam Smith,
 LL.D. and F.R.S. Formerly Professor of Moral Philosophy in the
University of Glasgow’. There is no preface or index. The whole of the
Contents are printed at the beginning of the first volume. The price was
 £1 16s.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt003" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt003_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_65">The second edition appeared early in 1778, priced at £2 2s.,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt004" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt004_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 but differing little in appearance from its predecessor. Its pages very
 nearly correspond, and the only very obvious difference is that the
Contents are now divided between the two volumes. There are, however, a
vast number of small differences between the first and second editions.
One of the least of these, the alteration of ‘late’ to ‘present,’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt005" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt005_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 draws our attention to the curious fact that writing at some time
before the spring of 1776 Adam Smith thought it safe to refer to the
American troubles as ‘the late disturbances’.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt006" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt006_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a>
 We cannot tell whether he thought the disturbances were actually over,
or only that he might safely assume they would be over before the book
was published. As ‘present disturbances’ also occurs close to ‘late
disturbances,’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt007" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt007_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">6</a>
 we may perhaps conjecture that when correcting his proofs in the winter
 of 1775-6, he had altered his opinion and only allowed ‘late’ to stand
by an oversight. A very large proportion of the alterations <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>xiv<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 are merely verbal, and made for the sake of greater elegance or
propriety of diction, such as the frequent change from ‘tear and wear’
(which occurs also in <span class="ital">Lectures,</span> p. 208) to the
 more ordinary ‘wear and tear’. Most of the footnotes appear first in
the second edition. A few corrections as to matters of fact are made,
such as that in relation to the percentage of the tax on silver in
Spanish America (vol. i., pp. 169, 170). Figures are corrected at vol.
i., p. 327, and vol. ii., pp. 371, 374. New information is added here
and there: an additional way of raising money by fictitious bills is
described in the long note at vol. i., p. 294; the details from Sandi as
 to the introduction of the silk manufacture into Venice are added (vol.
 i., p. 379); so also are the accounts of the tax on servants in Holland
 (vol. ii., pp. 341-2), and the mention of an often forgotten but
important quality of the land-tax, the possibility of reassessment
within the parish (vol. ii., p. 329). There are some interesting
alterations in the theory as to the emergence of profit and rent from
primitive conditions, though Smith himself would probably be surprised
at the importance which some modern inquirers attach to the points in
question (vol. i., pp. 49-52). At vol. i., pp. 99, 100, the fallacious
argument to prove that high profits raise prices more than high wages is
 entirely new, though the doctrine itself is asserted in another passage
 (vol. ii., p. 100). The insertion in the second edition of certain
cross-references at vol. i., pp. 195, 311, which do not occur in the
first edition, perhaps indicates that the Digressions on the Corn Laws
and the Bank of Amsterdam were somewhat late additions to the scheme of
the work. Beer is a necessary of life in one place and a luxury in
another in the first edition, but is nowhere a necessary in the second
(vol. i., p. 430; vol. ii., p. 355). The epigrammatic condemnation of
the East India Company at vol. ii., p. 137, appears first in the second
edition. At vol. ii., p. 284, we find ‘Christian’ substituted for ‘Roman
 Catholic,’ and the English puritans, who were ‘persecuted’ in the first
 edition, are only ‘restrained’ in the second (vol. ii., p.
90)—defections from the ultra-protestant standpoint perhaps due to the
posthumous working of the influence of Hume upon his friend.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_66">Between the second edition and the third, published at the end <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>xv<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of 1784,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt008" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt008_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 there are considerable differences. The third edition is in three
volumes, octavo, the first running to the end of Book II., chapter ii.,
and the second from that point to the end of the chapter on Colonies,
Book IV., chapter viii. The author by this time had overcome the
reluctance he felt in 1778 to have his office in the customs added to
his other distinctions<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt009" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt009_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 and consequently appears on the title-page as ‘Adam Smith, LL.D. and
F.R.S. of London and Edinburgh: one of the commissioners of his
Majesty’s Customs in Scotland; and formerly professor of Moral
Philosophy in the University of Glasgow’. The imprint is ‘London:
printed for A. Strahan; and T. Cadell, in the Strand’. This edition was
sold at one guinea.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt010" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt010_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> Prefixed to it is the following ‘Advertisement to the Third Edition’:—</p>
<div class="cit">
<p id="Smith_0206-01_67">‘The first Edition of the following Work was
printed in the end of the year 1775, and in the beginning of the year
1776. Through the greater part of the Book, therefore, whenever the
present state of things is mentioned, it is to be understood of the
state they were in, either about that time, or at some earlier period,
during the time I was employed in writing the Book. To this<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt011" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt011_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 third Edition, however, I have made several additions, particularly to
the chapter upon Drawbacks, and to that upon Bounties; likewise a new
chapter entitled, <span class="ital">The Conclusion of the Mercantile System;</span> and a new article to the chapter upon the expences of the sovereign. In all these additions, <span class="ital">the present state of things</span> means always the state in which they were during the year 1783 and the beginning of the present<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt012" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt012_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a> year 1784.’</p>
</div>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_68">Comparing the second and the third editions we
find that the additions to the third are considerable. As the Preface or
 ‘Advertisement’ just quoted remarks, the chapter entitled ‘Conclusion
of the Mercantile System’ (vol. ii., pp. 141-60) is entirely new, and so
 is the section ‘Of the Public Works and Institutions which are
necessary for facilitating particular Branches of Commerce’ (vol. ii.,
pp. 223-48). Certain passages in Book IV., chapter iii., on the
absurdity of the restrictions on trade with France (vol. i., pp. 437-8
and 459-60), the three pages near the beginning of Book IV., chapter
iv., upon the details of various drawbacks (vol. ii., pp. 2-5), the ten
paragraphs on the herring fishery bounty (vol. ii., pp. 20-4) with the
appendix on the same subject (pp. 435-7), and a portion of the
discussion of the effects of the corn bounty (vol. ii., <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>xvi<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 pp. 10-11) also appear first in the third edition. With several other
additions and corrections of smaller size these passages were printed
separately in quarto under the title of ‘Additions and Corrections to
the First and Second Editions of Dr. Adam Smith’s Inquiry into the
Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations’.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt013" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt013_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> Writing to Cadell in December, 1782, Smith says:—</p>
<div class="cit">
<p id="Smith_0206-01_69">‘I hope in two or three months to send you up
the second edition corrected in many places, with three or four very
considerable additions, chiefly to the second volume. Among the rest is a
 short but, I flatter myself, a complete history of all the trading
companies in Great Britain. These additions I mean not only to be
inserted at their proper places into the new edition, but to be printed
separately and to be sold for a shilling or half a crown to the
purchasers of the old edition. The price must depend on the bulk of the
additions when they are all written out.’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt014" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt014_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
</div>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_70">Besides the separately printed additions there
are many minor alterations between the second and third editions, such
as the complacent note on the adoption of the house tax (vol. ii., p.
328), the correction of the estimate of possible receipts from the
turnpikes (vol. ii., p. 218, <span class="ital">note</span>), and the
reference to the expense of the American war (vol. ii., p. 409), but
none of these is of much consequence. More important is the addition of
the lengthy index surmounted by the rather quaint superscription ‘N.B.
The Roman numerals refer to the Volume, and the figures to the Page’. We
 should not expect a man of Adam Smith’s character to make his own
index, and we may be quite certain that he did not do so when we find
the misprint ‘tallie’ in vol. ii., p. 320, reappearing in index (<span class="ital">s.v.</span>
 Montauban) although ‘taille’ has also a place there. But the index is
far from suggesting the work of an unintelligent back, and the fact that
 the ‘Ayr bank’ is named in it (<span class="ital">s.v.</span> Banks),
though nameless in the text, shows either that the index-maker had a
certain knowledge of Scotch banking history or that Smith corrected his
work in places. That Smith received a packet from Strahan ‘containing
some part of the index’ on 17th November, 1784, we know from his letter
to Cadell, published in the <span class="ital">Economic Journal</span> for September, 1898. Strahan had inquired whether the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>xvii<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 index was to be printed in quarto along with the Additions and
Corrections, and Smith reminded him that the numbers of the pages would
all have to be altered to ‘accommodate them to either of the two former
editions, of which the pages do not in many places correspond’. There is
 therefore no reason for not treating the index as an integral part of
the book.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_71">The fourth edition, published in 1786, is
printed in the same style and with exactly the same pagination as the
third. It reprints the advertisement to the third edition, altering,
however, the phrase ‘this third Edition,’ into ‘the third Edition,’ and
‘the present year 1784’ into ‘the year 1784,’ and adds the following
‘Advertisement to the Fourth Edition’:—</p>
<div class="cit">
<p id="Smith_0206-01_72">‘In this fourth Edition I have made no
alterations of any kind. I now, however, find myself at liberty to
acknowledge my very great obligations to Mr. <span class="csc">Henery Hop</span><a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt015" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt015_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 of Amsterdam. To that Gentleman I owe the most distinct, as well as
liberal information, concerning a very interesting and important
subject, the Bank of Amsterdam; of which no printed account had ever
appeared to me satisfactory, or even intelligible. The name of that
Gentleman is so well known in Europe, the information which comes from
him must do so much honour to whoever has been favoured with it, and my
vanity is so much interested in making this acknowledgment, that I can
no longer refuse myself the pleasure of prefixing this Advertisement to
this new Edition of my Book.’</p>
</div>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_73">In spite of his statement that he had made no
alterations of any kind, Smith either made or permitted a few trifling
alterations between the third and fourth editions. The subjunctive is
very frequently substituted for the indicative after ‘if,’ the phrase
‘if it was’ in particular being constantly altered to ‘if it were’. In
the note at vol. i., p. 71, ‘late disturbances’ is substituted for
‘present disturbances’. The other differences are so trifling that they
may be misreadings or unauthorised corrections of the printers.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_74">The fifth edition, the last published in
Smith’s lifetime and consequently the one from which the present edition
 has been copied, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>xviii<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 is dated 1789. It is almost identical with the fourth, the only
difference being that the misprints of the fourth edition are corrected
in the fifth and a considerable number of fresh ones introduced, while
several false concords—or concords regarded as false—are corrected (see
vol. i., p. 108; vol. ii., pp. 215, 249).<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt016" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt016_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_75">It is clear from the passage at vol. ii., p.
177, that Smith regarded the title ‘An Inquiry into the Nature and
Causes of the Wealth of Nations’ as a synonym for ‘political œconomy,’
and it seems perhaps a little surprising that he did not call his book ‘<span class="ital">Political Œconomy</span>’ or ‘<span class="ital">Principles of Political Œconomy</span>’.
 But we must remember that the term was still in 1776 a very new one,
and that it had been used in the title of Sir James Steuart’s great
book, <span class="ital">An Inquiry into the Principles of Political Œconomy: being an Essay on the Science of Domestic Policy in Free Nations,</span>
 which was published in 1767. Nowadays, of course, no author has any
special claim to exclusive use of the title. We should as soon think of
claiming copyright for the title ‘Arithmetic’ or ‘Elements of Geology’
as for ‘Principles of Political Economy’. But in 1776 Adam Smith may
well have refrained from using it simply because it had been used by
Steuart nine years before, especially considering the fact that the <span class="ital">Wealth of Nations</span> was to be brought out by the publishers who had brought out Steuart’s book.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt017" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt017_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_76">From 1759 at the latest an early draft of what subsequently developed into the <span class="ital">Wealth of Nations</span>
 existed in the portion of Smith’s lectures on ‘Jurisprudence’ which he
called ‘Police, Revenue and Arms,’ the rest of ‘Jurisprudence’ being
‘Justice’ and the ‘Laws of Nations.’ Jurisprudence he defined as ‘that
science which inquires into the general principles which ought to <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>xix<span class="bracket">]</span></span> be the foundation of the laws of all nations,’ or as ‘the theory of the general principles of law and government’.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt018" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt018_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> In forecasting his lectures on the subject he told his students:—</p>
<div class="cit">
<p id="Smith_0206-01_77">‘The four great objects of law are justice, police, revenue and arms.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_78">‘The object of justice is the security from injury, and it is the foundation of civil government.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_79">‘The objects of police are the cheapness of
commodities, public security, and cleanliness, if the two last were not
too minute for a lecture of this kind. Under this head we will consider
the opulence of a state.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_80">‘It is likewise necessary that the magistrate
who bestows his time and labour in the business of the state should be
compensated for it. For this purpose and for defraying the expenses of
government some fund must be raised. Hence the origin of revenue. The
subject of consideration under this head will be the proper means of
levying revenue, which must come from the people by taxes, duties,
&amp;c. In general, whatever revenue can be raised most insensibly from
the people ought to be preferred, and in the sequel it is proposed to be
 shown how far the laws of Britain and other European nations are
calculated for this purpose.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_81">‘As the best police cannot give security unless
 the government can defend themselves from foreign injuries and attacks,
 the fourth thing appointed by law is for this purpose; and under this
head will be shown the different species of arms with their advantages
and disadvantages, the constitution of standing armies, militias,
&amp;c.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_82">‘After these will be considered the laws of nations. . . .’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt019" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt019_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
</div>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_83">The connection of revenue and arms with the
general principles of law and government is obvious enough, and no
question arises as to the explanation on these heads given by the
forecast. But to ‘consider the opulence of a state’ under the head of
‘police’ seems at first sight a little strange. For the explanation we
turn to the beginning of the part of the lectures relating to Police.</p>
<div class="cit">
<p id="Smith_0206-01_84">‘Police is the second general division of
jurisprudence. The name is French, and is originally derived from the
Greek πολιτεία, which properly signified the policy of civil government,
 but now it only means the regulation of the inferior parts of
government, <span class="ital">viz.:</span> cleanliness, security, and cheapness or plenty.’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt020" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt020_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
</div>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_85">That this definition of the French word was correct is well shown by the following passage from a book which is known to have <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>xx<span class="bracket">]</span></span> been in Smith’s possession at his death,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt021" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt021_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> Bielfeld’s <span class="ital">Institutions politiques,</span> 1760 (tom. i., p. 99).</p>
<div class="cit">
<p id="Smith_0206-01_86">‘Le premier Président du Harlay en recevant M.
d’Argenson à la charge de lieutenant général de police de la ville de
Paris, lui adressa ces paroles, qui méritent d’être remarquées: Le Roi,
Monsieur, vous demande sûreté, netteté, bon-marché. En effet ces trois
articles comprennent toute la police, qui forme le troisième grand objet
 de la politique pour l’intérieur de l’État.’</p>
</div>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_87">When we find that the chief of the Paris police
 in 1697 was expected to provide cheapness as well as security and
cleanliness, we wonder less at the inclusion of ‘cheapness or plenty’ or
 the ‘opulence of a state’ in ‘jurisprudence’ or ‘the general principles
 of law and government’. ‘Cheapness is in fact the same thing with
plenty,’ and ‘the consideration of cheapness or plenty’ is ‘the same
thing’ as ‘the most proper way of securing wealth and abundance’.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt022" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt022_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 If Adam Smith had been an old-fashioned believer in state control of
trade and industry he would have described the most proper regulations
for securing wealth and abundance, and there would have been nothing
strange in this description coming under the ‘general principles of law
and government’. The actual strangeness is simply the result of Smith’s
negative attitude—of his belief that past and present regulations were
for the most part purely mischievous.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_88">The two items, cleanliness and security, he
managed to dismiss very shortly: ‘the proper method of carrying dirt
from the streets, and the execution of justice, so far as it regards
regulations for preventing crimes or the method of keeping a city guard,
 though useful, are too mean to be considered in a general discourse of
this kind’.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt023" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt023_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 He only offered the observation that the establishment of arts and
commerce brings about independency and so is the best police for
preventing crimes. It gives the common people better wages, and ‘in
consequence of this a general probity of manners takes place through the
 whole country. Nobody will be so mad as to expose himself upon the
highway, when he can make better bread in an honest and industrious
manner.’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt024" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt024_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_89">He then came to ‘cheapness or plenty, or, which is the same thing, the most proper way of securing wealth and abundance’. <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>xxi<span class="bracket">]</span></span> He began this part of the subject by considering the ‘natural wants of mankind which are to be supplied,’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt025" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt025_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 a subject which has since acquired the title of ‘consumption’ in
economic treatises. Then he showed that opulence arises from division of
 labour, and why this is so, or how the division of labour ‘occasions a
multiplication of the product,’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt026" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt026_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 and why it must be proportioned to the extent of commerce. ‘Thus,’ he
said, ‘the division of labour is the great cause of the increase of
public opulence, which is always proportioned to the industry of the
people, and not to the quantity of gold and silver as is foolishly
imagined’. ‘Having thus shown what gives occasion to public opulence,’
he said he would go on to consider:—</p>
<div class="cit">
<p id="Smith_0206-01_90">‘First, what circumstances regulate the price of commodities:</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_91">‘Secondly, money in two different views, first as the measure of value and then as the instrument of commerce:</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_92">‘Thirdly, the history of commerce, in which
shall be taken notice of the causes of the slow progress of opulence,
both in ancient and modern times, which causes shall be shown either to
affect agriculture or arts and manufactures:</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_93">‘Lastly, the effects of a commercial spirit, on
 the government, temper, and manners of a people, whether good or bad,
and the proper remedies.’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt027" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt027_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
</div>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_94">Under the first of these heads he treated of
natural and market price and of differences of wages, and showed ‘that
whatever police tends to raise the market price above the natural, tends
 to diminish public opulence’.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt028" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt028_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 Among such pernicious regulations he enumerated taxes upon necessaries,
 monopolies, and exclusive privileges of corporations. Regulations which
 bring market price below natural price he regarded as equally
pernicious, and therefore he condemned the corn bounty, which attracted
into agriculture stock which would have been better employed in some
other trade. ‘It is by far the best police to leave things to their
natural course.’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt029" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt029_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_95">Under the second head he explained the reasons
for the use of money as a common standard and its consequential use as
the instrument of commerce. He showed why gold and silver were commonly
chosen and why coinage was introduced, and proceeded <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>xxii<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 to explain the evils of tampering with the currency, and the difficulty
 of keeping gold and silver money in circulation at the same time. Money
 being a dead stock, banks and paper credit, which enable money to be
dispensed with and sent abroad, are beneficial. The money sent abroad
will ‘bring home materials for food, clothes, and lodging,’ and,
‘whatever commodities are imported, just so much is added to the
opulence of the country’.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt030" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt030_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> It is ‘a bad police to restrain’ banks.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt031" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt031_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> Mun, ‘a London merchant,’ affirmed ‘that as England is drained of its money it must go to ruin’.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt032" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt032_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 ‘Mr. Gee, likewise a merchant,’ endeavoured to ‘show that England would
 soon be ruined by trade with foreign countries,’ and that ‘in almost
all our commercial dealings with other nations we are losers’.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt033" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt033_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 Mr. Hume had shown the absurdity of these and other such doctrines,
though even he had not kept quite clear of ‘the notion that public
opulence consists in money’.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt034" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt034_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a> Money is not consumable, and ‘the consumptibility, if we may use the word, of goods, is the great cause of human industry’.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt035" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt035_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">6</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_96">The absurd opinion that riches consist in money had given rise to ‘many prejudicial errors in practice,’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt036" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt036_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">7</a>
 such as the prohibition of the exportation of coin and attempts to
secure a favourable balance of trade. There will always be plenty of
money if things are left to their free course, and no prohibition of
exportation will be effectual. The desire to secure a favourable balance
 of trade has led to ‘most pernicious regulations,’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt037" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt037_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">8</a> such as the restrictions on trade with France.</p>
<div class="cit">
<p id="Smith_0206-01_97">‘The absurdity of these regulations will appear
 on the least reflection. All commerce that is carried on betwixt any
two countries must necessarily be advantageous to both. The very
intention of commerce is to exchange your own commodities for others
which you think will be more convenient for you. When two men trade
between themselves it is undoubtedly for the advantage of both. . . .
The case is exactly the same betwixt any two nations. The goods which
the English merchants want to import from France are certainly more
valuable to them than what they give for them.’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt038" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt038_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">9</a></p>
</div>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_98">These jealousies and prohibitions were most
hurtful to the richest nations, and it would benefit France and England
especially, if ‘all <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>xxiii<span class="bracket">]</span></span> national prejudices were rooted out and a free and uninterrupted commerce established’.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt039" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt039_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 No nation was ever ruined by this balance of trade. All political
writers since the time of Charles II. had been prophesying ‘that in a
few years we would be reduced to an absolute state of poverty,’ but ‘we
find ourselves far richer than before’.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt040" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt040_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_99">The erroneous notion that national opulence
consists in money had also given rise to the absurd opinion that ‘no
home consumption can hurt the opulence of a country’.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt041" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt041_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_100">It was this notion too that led to Law’s Mississippi scheme, compared to which our own South Sea scheme was a trifle.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt042" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt042_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_101">Interest does not depend on the value of

commerce, or the causes of the slow progress of opulence, Adam Smith
dealt with ‘first, natural impediments, and secondly, the oppression of
civil government’.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt044" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt044_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">6</a>
 He is not recorded to have mentioned any natural impediments except the
 absence of division of labour in rude and barbarous times owing to the
want of stock.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt045" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt045_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">7</a>
 But on the oppression of civil government he had much to say. At first
governments were so feeble that they could not offer their subjects that
 security without which no man has any motive to be industrious.
Afterwards, when governments became powerful enough to give internal
security, they fought among themselves, and their subjects were harried
by foreign enemies. Agriculture was hindered by great tracts of land
being thrown into the hands of single persons. This led at first to
cultivation by slaves, who had no motive to industry; then came tenants
by steelbow (metayers) who had no sufficient inducement to improve the
land; finally the present method of cultivation by tenants was
introduced, but these for a long time were insecure in their holdings,
and had to pay rent in kind, which made them liable to be severely
affected by bad seasons. Feudal subsidies discouraged industry, the law
of primogeniture, entails, and the expense of transferring land
prevented the large estates from being divided. The restrictions <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>xxiv<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 on the export of corn helped to stop the progress of agriculture.
Progress in arts and commerce was also hindered by slavery, as well as
by the ancient contempt for industry and commerce, by the want of
enforcement of contracts, by the various difficulties and dangers of
transport, by the establishment of fairs, markets and staple towns, by
duties on imports and exports, and by monopolies, corporation
privileges, the statute of apprenticeship and bounties.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt046" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt046_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_103">Under the fourth and last head, the influence
of commerce on the manners of a people, Smith pronounced that ‘whenever
commerce is introduced into any country probity and punctuality always
accompany it’.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt047" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt047_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 The trader deals so often that he finds honesty is the best policy.
‘Politicians are not the most remarkable men in the world for probity
and punctuality. Ambassadors from different nations are still less so,’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt048" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt048_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> the reason being that nations treat with one another much more seldom than merchants.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_104">But certain inconveniences arise from a
commercial spirit. Men’s views are confined, and ‘when a person’s whole
attention is bestowed on the seventeenth part of a pin or the eightieth
part of a button,’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt049" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt049_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 he becomes stupid. Education is neglected. In Scotland the meanest
porter can read and write, but at Birmingham boys of six or seven can
earn threepence or sixpence a day, so that their parents set them to
work early and their education is neglected. To be able merely to read
is good as it ‘gives people the benefit of religion, which is a great
advantage, not only considered in a pious sense, but as it affords them
subject for thought and speculation.’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt050" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt050_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a>
 There is too ‘another great loss which attends the putting boys too
soon to work’. The boys throw off parental authority, and betake
themselves to drunkenness and riot. The workmen in the commercial parts
of England are consequently in a ‘despicable condition; their work
through half the week is sufficient to maintain them, and through want
of education they have no amusement for the other but riot and
debauchery. So it may very justly be said that the people who clothe the
 whole world are in rags themselves.’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt051" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt051_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">6</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>xxv<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_105">Further, commerce sinks courage and
extinguishes martial spirit; the defence of the country is handed over
to a special class, and the bulk of the people grow effeminate and
dastardly, as was shown by the fact that in 1745 ‘four or five thousand
naked unarmed Highlanders would have overturned the government of Great
Britain with little difficulty if they had not been opposed by a
standing army’.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt052" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt052_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_106">‘To remedy’ these evils introduced by commerce ‘would be an object worthy of serious attention.’</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_107">Revenue, at any rate in the year when the
notes of his lectures were made, was treated by Adam Smith before the
last head of police just discussed, ostensibly on the ground that it was
 in reality one of the causes of the slow progress of opulence.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt053" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt053_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_108">Originally, he taught, no revenue was
necessary; the magistrate was satisfied with the eminence of his station
 and any presents he might receive. The receipt of presents soon led to
corruption. At first too soldiers were unpaid, but this did not last.
The earliest method adopted for supplying revenue was assignment of
lands to the support of government. To maintain the British government
would require at least a fourth of the whole of the land of the country.
 ‘After government becomes expensive, it is the worst possible method to
 support it by a land rent.’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt054" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt054_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> Civilisation and expensive government go together.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_109">Taxes may be divided into taxes upon
possessions and taxes upon commodities. It is easy to tax land, but
difficult to tax stock or money; the land tax is very cheaply collected
and does not raise the price of commodities and thus restrict the number
 of persons who have stock sufficient to carry on trade in them. It is
hard on the landlords to have to pay both land tax and taxes on
consumption, which fact ‘perhaps occasions the continuance of what is
called the Tory interest’.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt055" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt055_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_110">Taxes on consumptions are best levied by way of excise. They have the advantage of ‘being paid imperceptibly,’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt056" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt056_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a>
 since ‘when we buy a pound of tea we do not reflect that the most part
of the price is a duty paid to the government, and therefore pay it
contentedly, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>xxvi<span class="bracket">]</span></span> as though it were only the natural price of the commodity’.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt057" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt057_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Such taxes too are less likely to ruin people than a land tax, as they
can always reduce their expenditure on dutiable articles.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_111">A fixed land tax like the English is better
than one which varies with the rent like the French, and ‘the English
are the best financiers in Europe, and their taxes are levied with more
propriety than those of any other country whatever’.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt058" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt058_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 Taxes on importation are hurtful because they divert industry into an
unnatural channel, but taxes on exportation are worse. The common belief
 that wealth consists in money has not been so hurtful as might have
been expected in regard to taxes on imports, since it has accidentally
led to the encouragement of the import of raw material and
discouragement of the import of manufactured articles.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt059" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt059_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_112">From treating of revenue Adam Smith was very
naturally led on to deal with national debts, and this led him into a
discussion of the causes of the rise and fall of stocks and the practice
 of stockjobbing.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt060" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt060_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_113">Under Arms he taught that at first the whole
people goes out to war: then only the upper classes go and the meanest
stay to cultivate the ground. But afterwards the introduction of arts
and manufactures makes it inconvenient for the rich to leave their
business, and the defence of the state falls to the meanest. ‘This is
our present condition in Great Britain.’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt061" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt061_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a>
 Discipline now becomes necessary and standing armies are introduced.
The best sort of army is ‘a militia commanded by landed gentlemen in
possession of the public offices of the nation,’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt062" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt062_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">6</a> which ‘can never have any prospect of sacrificing the liberties of the country’. This is the case in Sweden.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_114">Now let us compare with this the drift of the <span class="ital">Wealth of Nations,</span> not as it is described in the ‘Introduction and Plan,’ but as we find it in the body of the work itself.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_115"><span id="lf0206-01_label_097">Book I.</span>
begins by showing that the greatest improvement in the productive powers
 of industry is due to division of labour. From division of labour it
proceeds to money, because money is necessary <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>xxvii<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 in order to facilitate division of labour, which depends upon exchange.
 This naturally leads to a discussion of the terms on which exchanges
are effected, or value and price. Consideration of price reveals the
fact that it is divided between wages, profit and rent, and is therefore
 dependent on the rates of wages, profit and rent, so that it is
necessary to discuss in four chapters variations in these rates.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_116"><span id="lf0206-01_label_098">Book II.</span>
 treats first of the nature and divisions of stock, secondly of a
particularly important portion of it, namely money, and the means by
which that part may be economised by the operations of banking, and
thirdly the accumulation of capital, which is connected with the
employment of productive labour. Fourthly it considers the rise and fall
 of the rate of interest, and fifthly and lastly the comparative
advantage of different methods of employing capital.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_117"><span id="lf0206-01_label_099">Book III.</span>
 shows that the natural progress of opulence is to direct capital, first
 to agriculture, then to manufactures, and lastly to foreign commerce,
but that this order has been inverted by the policy of modern European
states.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_118"><span id="lf0206-01_label_100">Book IV.</span>
 deals with two different systems of political economy: (1) the system
of commerce, and (2) the system of agriculture, but the space given to
the former, even in the first edition, is eight times as great as that
given to the latter. The first chapter shows the absurdity of the
principle of the commercial or mercantile system, that wealth is
dependent on the balance of trade; the next five discuss in detail and
show the futility of the various mean and malignant expedients by which
the mercantilists endeavoured to secure their absurd object, namely,
general protectionist duties, prohibitions and heavy duties directed
against the importation of goods from particular countries with which
the balance is supposed to be disadvantageous, drawbacks, bounties, and
treaties of commerce. The seventh chapter, which is a long one, deals
with colonies. According to the forecast at the end of chapter i. this
subject comes here because colonies were established in order to
encourage exportation by means of peculiar privileges and monopolies.
But in the chapter itself there is no sign of this. The history and
progress of colonies is discussed for its own sake, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>xxviii<span class="bracket">]</span></span> and it is not alleged that important colonies have been founded with the object suggested in chapter i.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_119">In the last chapter of the Book, the
physiocratic system is described, and judgement is pronounced against it
 as well as the commercial system. The proper system is that of natural
liberty, which discharges the sovereign from ‘the duty of superintending
 the industry of private people and of directing it towards the
employments most suitable to the interest of the society’.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_120"><span id="lf0206-01_label_101">Book V.</span>
deals with the expenses of the sovereign in performing the duties left
to him, the revenues necessary to meet those expenses and the results of
 expenses exceeding revenue. The discussion of expenses of defence
includes discussion of different kinds of military organisation, courts
of law, means of maintaining public works, education, and ecclesiastical
 establishments.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_121">Putting these two sketches together we can easily see how closely related the book is to the lectures.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_122">The title ‘Police’ being dropped as not
sufficiently indicating the subject, there is no necessity for the
mention of cleanliness, and the remarks on security are removed to the
chapter on the accumulation of capital. The two sections on the natural
wants of mankind are omitted,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt063" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt063_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 illustrating once more the difficulty which economists have generally
felt about consumption. The next four sections, on division of labour,
develop into the first three chapters of Book I. of the <span class="ital">Wealth of Nations.</span>
 At this point in the lectures there is an abrupt transition to prices,
followed by money, the history of commerce and the effects of a
commercial spirit, but in the <span class="ital">Wealth of Nations</span>
 this is avoided by taking money next, as the machinery by the aid of
which labour is divided, and then proceeding by a very natural
transition to prices. In the lectures the discussion of money led to a
consideration of the notion that wealth consisted in money and of all
the pernicious consequences of that delusion in restricting banking and
foreign trade. This was evidently overloading the theory of money, and
consequently banking is postponed to the Book about capital, on the
ground that it dispenses with money, which is a dead stock, and thus
economises capital, while the commercial policy is relegated <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>xxix<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 by itself to Book IV. In the lectures, again, wages are only dealt with
 slightly under prices, and profits and rent not at all; in the <span class="ital">Wealth of Nations</span>
 wages, profits and rent are dealt with at length as component parts of
price, and the whole produce of the country is said to be distributed
into them as three shares.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_123">The next part of the lectures, that dealing
with the causes of the slow progress of opulence, forms the foundation
for Book III. of the <span class="ital">Wealth of Nations.</span> The
influence of commerce on manners disappears as an independent heading,
but most of the matter dealt with under it is utilised in the
discussions of education and military organisation.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_124">Besides consumption, two other subjects,
stock-jobbing and the Mississippi scheme, which are treated at some
length in the lectures, are altogether omitted in the <span class="ital">Wealth of Nations.</span>
 The description of stock-jobbing was probably left out because better
suited to the youthful hearers of the lectures than to the maturer
readers of the book. The Mississippi scheme was omitted, Smith himself
says, because it had been adequately discussed by Du Verney.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_125">Here and there discrepancies may be found
between the opinions expressed in the lectures and those expressed in
the book. The reasonable and straightforward view of the effects of the
corn bounty is replaced by a more recondite though less satisfactory
doctrine. The remark as to the inconvenience of regulations on foreign
commerce having been alleviated by the fact that they encourage trade
with countries from which imported raw materials came and discourage it
with those from which manufactured goods came<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt064" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt064_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> does not reappear in the book. The passage in the <span class="ital">Lectures</span>
 is probably much condensed, and perhaps misrepresents what Adam Smith
said. If it does not, it shows him to have been not entirely free from
protectionist fallacies at the time the lectures were delivered.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt065" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt065_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_126">There are some very obvious additions, the
most prominent being the account of the French physiocratic or
agricultural system which occupies the last chapter of Book IV. The
article on the relations of church and state (Bk. V., ch. i., pt. iii.,
art. 3) also appears to be a clear addition, at any rate in so far as
the lectures on police <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>xxx<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 and revenue are concerned, but, as we shall see presently, tradition
seems to say that Smith did deal with ecclesiastical establishments in
this department of his lectures on jurisprudence, so that possibly the
lecture notes are deficient at this particular point, or the subject was
 omitted for the particular year in which the notes were taken. Then
there is the long chapter on colonies. The fact of colonies having
attracted Adam Smith’s attention during the interval between the
lectures and the publication of his book is not very surprising when we
remember that the interval coincided almost exactly with the period from
 the beginning of the attempt to tax the colonies to the Declaration of
Independence.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_127">But these additions are of small importance
compared with the introduction of the theory of stock or capital and
unproductive labour in Book II., the slipping of a theory of
distribution into the theory of prices towards the end of Book I.,
chapter vi., and the emphasising of the conception of annual produce.
These changes do not make so much real difference to Smith’s own work as
 might be supposed; the theory of distribution, though it appears in the
 title of Book I., is no essential part of the work and could easily be
excised by deleting a few paragraphs in Book I., chapter vi., and a few
lines elsewhere; if Book II. were altogether omitted the other Books
could stand perfectly well by themselves. But to subsequent economics
they were of fundamental importance. They settled the form of economic
treatises for a century at least.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_128">They were of course due to the acquaintance with the French <span class="ital">Économistes</span>
 which Adam Smith made during his visit to France with the Duke of
Buccleugh in 1764-6. It has been said that he might have been acquainted
 with many works of this school before the notes of his lectures were
taken, and so he might. But the notes of his lectures are good evidence
to show that as a matter of fact he was not, or at any rate that he had
not assimilated their main economic theories. When we find that there is
 no trace of these theories in the <span class="ital">Lectures</span> and a great deal in the <span class="ital">Wealth of Nations,</span>
 and that in the meantime Adam Smith had been to France and mixed with
all the prominent members of the ‘sect,’ including their master,
Quesnay, it is difficult to understand why we should be asked, without
any evidence, to refrain from believing that he <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>xxxi<span class="bracket">]</span></span> came under physiocratic influence after and not before or during his Glasgow period.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_129">The confession of faith of the <span class="ital">Économistes</span> is embodied in Quesnay’s <span class="ital">Tableau Économique,</span>
 which one of them described as worthy of being ranked, along with
writing and money, as one of the three greatest inventions of the human
race.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt066" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt066_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 It is reprinted on the next page from the facsimile of the edition of
1759, published by the British Economic Association (now the Royal
Economic Society) in 1894.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_130">Those who are curious as to the exact meaning of the zigzag lines may study Quesnay’s <span class="ital">Explication,</span>
 which the British Economic Association published along with the table
in 1894. For our present purposes it is sufficient to see (1) that it
involves a conception of the whole annual produce or reproduction of a
country; (2) that it teaches that some labour is unproductive, that to
maintain the annual produce certain ‘<span class="ital">avances</span>’
are necessary, and that this annual produce is ‘distributed’. Adam
Smith, as his chapter on agricultural systems shows, did not appreciate
the minutiæ of the table very highly, but he certainly took these main
ideas and adapted them as well as he could to his Glasgow theories. With
 those theories the conception of an annual produce was in no way
inconsistent, and he had no difficulty in adopting annual produce as the
 wealth of a nation, though he very often forgetfully falls back into
older ways of speaking. As to unproductive labour, he was not prepared
to condemn the whole of Glasgow industry as sterile, but was ready to
place the mediæval retainer and even the modern menial servant in the
unproductive class. He would even go a little farther and put along with
 them all whose labour did not produce particular vendible objects, or
who were not employed for the money-gain of their employers. Becoming
somewhat confused among these distinctions and the physiocratic doctrine
 of ‘<span class="ital">avances,</span>’ he imagined a close connexion
between the employment of productive labour and the accumulation and
employment of capital. Hence with the aid of the common observation that
 where a capitalist appears, labourers soon spring up, he arrived at the
 view that the amount of capital in a country determines <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>xxxii<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 the number of ‘useful and productive’ labourers. Finally he slipped
into his theory of prices and their component parts the suggestion that
as the price of any one commodity is divided between wages, profits and
rent, so the whole produce is divided between labourers, capitalists,
and landlords.</p>

</div>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_131">These ideas about capital and unproductive
labour are certainly of great importance in the history of economic
theory, but they were fundamentally unsound, and were never so
universally accepted as is commonly supposed. The conception of the
wealth of nations as an annual produce, annually distributed, however,
has been of immense value. Like other conceptions of the kind it was
certain to come. It might have been evolved direct from Davenant or
Petty nearly a century before. We need not suppose that some one else
would not soon have given it its place in English economics if Adam
Smith had not done so, but that need not deter us from recording the
fact that it was he who introduced it, and that he introduced it in
consequence of his association with the <span class="ital">Économistes.</span></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_132">If we attempt to carry the history of the origin of the <span class="ital">Wealth of Nations</span>
 farther back than the date of the lecture notes in 1763 or thereabouts,
 we can still find a small amount of authentic information. We know that
 Smith must have been using practically the same divisions in his
lectures in 1759, since he promises in the last paragraph of the <span class="ital">Moral Sentiments</span>
 published in that year, ‘another discourse’ in which he would
‘endeavour to give an account of the general principles of law and
government, and of the different revolutions they have undergone in the
different ages and periods of society, not only in what concerns
justice, but in what concerns police, revenue and arms, and whatever
else is the object of law.’ It seems probable, however, that the
economic portion of the lectures was not always headed ‘police, revenue,
 and arms,’ since Millar, who attended the lectures when they were first
 delivered in 1751-2, says:—</p>
<div class="cit">
<p id="Smith_0206-01_133">‘In the last part of his lectures he examined those political regulations which are founded not upon the principle of <span class="ital">justice,</span> but that of <span class="ital">expediency,</span>
 and which are calculated to increase the riches, the power and the
prosperity of a state. Under this view, he considered the political
institutions relating to commerce, to finances, to ecclesiastical and
military establishments. What <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>xxxiv<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 he delivered on these subjects contained the substance of the work he
afterwards published under the title of “An Inquiry into the Nature and
Causes of the Wealth of Nations”.’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt067" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt067_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
</div>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_134">Of course this is not necessarily inconsistent
 with the economic lectures having been denominated police, revenue, and
 arms, even at that early date, but the italicising of ‘justice’ and
‘expediency,’ if due to Millar, rather suggests the contrary, and there
is no denying that the arrangement of ‘cheapness or plenty’ under
‘police’ may very well have been an afterthought fallen upon to justify
the introduction of a mass of economic material into lectures on
Jurisprudence. As to the reason why that introduction took place the
circumstances of Smith’s first active session at Glasgow suggest another
 motive besides his love for the subject, which, we may notice, did not
prevent him from publishing his views on Ethics first.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_135">His first appointment at Glasgow, it must be
remembered, was to the Professorship of Logic in January, 1751, but his
engagements at Edinburgh prevented his performing the duties that
session. Before the beginning of next session he was asked to act as
deputy for Craigie, the Professor of Moral Philosophy, who was going
away for the benefit of his health. He consented, and consequently in
the session of 1751-2 he had to begin the work of two professorships, as
 to one of which he had very little previous warning.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt068" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt068_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 Every teacher in such a position would do his best to utilise any
suitable material which he happened to have by him, and most men would
even stretch a point to utilise even what was not perfectly suitable.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_136">Now we know that Adam Smith possessed in
manuscript in the hand of a clerk employed by him certain lectures which
 he read at Edinburgh in the winter of 1750-1, and we know that in these
 lectures he preached the doctrine of the beneficial effects of freedom,
 and, according to Dugald Stewart, ‘many of the most important opinions
in the <span class="ital">Wealth of Nations</span>’. There existed when Stewart wrote, ‘a short manuscript drawn up by Mr. Smith in the year <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>xxxv<span class="bracket">]</span></span> 1755 and presented by him to a society of which he was then a member’. Stewart says of this paper:—</p>
<div class="cit">
<p id="Smith_0206-01_137">‘Many of the most important opinions in <span class="ital">The Wealth of Nations</span>
 are there detailed; but I shall quote only the following sentences:
“Man is generally considered by statesmen and projectors as the
materials of a sort of political mechanics. Projectors disturb nature in
 the course of her operations in human affairs; and it requires no more
than to let her alone, and give her fair play in the pursuit of her ends
 that she may establish her own designs.” And in another passage:
“Little else is requisite to carry a state to the highest degree of
opulence from the lowest barbarism, but peace, easy taxes, and a
tolerable administration of justice; all the rest being brought about by
 the natural course of things. All governments which thwart this natural
 course, which force things into another channel or which endeavour to
arrest the progress of society at a particular point, are unnatural, and
 to support themselves are obliged to be oppressive and tyrannical.—A
great part of the opinions,” he observes, “enumerated in this paper is
treated of at length in some lectures which I have still by me, and
which were written in the hand of a clerk who left my service six years
ago. They have all of them been the constant subjects of my lectures
since I first taught Mr. Craigie’s class, the first winter I spent in
Glasgow, down to this day, without any considerable variation. They had
all of them been the subjects of lectures which I read at Edinburgh the
winter before I left it, and I can adduce innumerable witnesses both
from that place and from this, who will ascertain them sufficiently to
be mine.” ’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt069" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt069_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
</div>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_138">It seems then that, when confronted with the
two professorial chairs in 1751, Smith had by him some lectures on
progress, very likely explaining ‘the slow progress of opulence,’ and
that, as anyone in such circumstances would have liked to do, he put
them into his moral philosophy course.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_139">As it happened, there was no difficulty in
doing this. It seems nearly certain that Craigie himself suggested that
it should be done. The request that Smith would take Craigie’s work came
 through Cullen, and in answering Cullen’s letter, which has not been
preserved, Smith says, ‘You mention natural jurisprudence and politics
as the parts of his lectures which it would be most agreeable for me to
teach. I shall very willingly undertake both.’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt070" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt070_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> Craigie doubtless knew what Smith had been lecturing upon in Edinburgh in the previous winter and called it ‘politics’.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_140">Moreover the traditions of the Chair of Moral Philosophy, as <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>xxxvi<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 known to Adam Smith, required a certain amount of economics. A dozen
years earlier he had himself been a student when Francis Hutcheson was
professor. So far as we can judge from Hutcheson’s <span class="ital">System of Moral Philosophy,</span> which, as Dr. W. R. Scott has shown,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt071" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt071_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 was already in existence when Smith was a student, though not published
 till 1755, Hutcheson lectured first on Ethics, next upon what might
very well be called Natural Jurisprudence, and thirdly upon Civil
Polity. Through the two latter parts a considerable quantity of economic
 doctrine is scattered.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_141">In considering ‘The Necessity of a Social
Life,’ Hutcheson points out that a man in solitude, however strong and
instructed in the arts, ‘could scarce procure to himself the bare
necessaries of life even in the best soils or climates’.</p>
<div class="cit">
<p id="Smith_0206-01_142">‘Nay ’tis well known that the produce of the
labours of any given number, twenty for instance, in providing the
necessaries or conveniences of life, shall be much greater by assigning
to one a certain sort of work of one kind in which he will soon acquire
skill and dexterity, and to another assigning work of a different kind,
than if each one of the twenty were obliged to employ himself by turns
in all the different sorts of labour requisite for his subsistence
without sufficient dexterity in any. In the former method each procures a
 great quantity of goods of one kind, and can exchange a part of it for
such goods obtained by the labours of others as he shall stand in need
of. One grows expert in tillage, another in pasture and breeding cattle,
 a third in masonry, a fourth in the chase, a fifth in iron-works, a
sixth in the arts of the loom, and so on throughout the rest. Thus all
are supplied by means of barter with the works of complete artists. In
the other method scarce any one could be dexterous and skilful in any
one sort of labour.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_143">‘Again, some works of the highest use to
multitudes can be effectually executed by the joint labours of many,
which the separate labours of the same number could never have executed.
 The joint force of many can repel dangers arising from savage beasts or
 bands of robbers which might have been fatal to many individuals were
they separately to encounter them. The joint labours of twenty men will
cultivate forests or drain marshes, for farms to each one, and provide
houses for habitation and inclosures for their flocks, much sooner than
the separate labours of the same number. By concert and alternate relief
 they can keep a perpetual watch, which without concert they could not
accomplish.’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt072" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt072_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>

<p id="Smith_0206-01_144">In explaining the ‘Foundation of Property’
Hutcheson says that when population was scanty, the country fertile and
the climate mild, there was not much need for developing the rules of
property, but as things are, ‘universal industry is plainly necessary
for the support of mankind’ and men must be excited to labour by
self-interest and family affection. If the fruits of men’s labours are
not secured to them, ‘one has no other motive to labour than the general
 affection to his kind, which is commonly much weaker than the narrower
affections to our friends and relations, not to mention the opposition
which in this case would be given by most of the selfish ones’. Willing
industry could not be secured in a communistic society.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt073" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt073_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_145">The largest continuous block of economic doctrine in the <span class="ital">System of Moral Philosophy</span>
 is to be found in the chapter on ‘The Values of Goods in Commerce and
the Nature of Coin’ which occurs in the middle of the discussion of
contracts. In this chapter it is pointed out that it is necessary for
commerce that goods should be valued. The values of goods depend on the
demand for them and the difficulty of acquiring them. Values must be
measured by some common standard, and this standard must be something
generally desired, so that men may be generally willing to take it in
exchange. To secure this it should be something portable, divisible
without loss, and durable. Gold and silver best fulfil these
requirements. At first they were used by quantity or weight, without
coinage, but eventually the state vouched for quantity and quality by
its stamp. The stamp being ‘easy workmanship’ adds no considerable
value. ‘Coin is ever valued as a commodity in commerce as well as other
goods; and that in proportion to the rarity of the metal, for the demand
 is universal.’ The only way to raise its value artificially would be by
 restricting the produce of the mines.</p>
<div class="cit">
<p id="Smith_0206-01_146">‘We say indeed commonly, that the rates of
labour and goods have risen since these metals grew plenty; and that the
 rates of labour and goods were low when the metals were scarce;
conceiving the value of the metals as invariable, because the legal
names of the pieces, the pounds, shillings or pence, continue to them
always the same till a law alters them. But a day’s digging or ploughing
 was as uneasy to a man a thousand years ago as it is now, though he
could not then get so much silver for it: and a barrel of wheat, or
beef, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>xxxviii<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 was then of the same use to support the human body, as it is now when
it is exchanged for four times as much silver. Properly, the value of
labour, grain, and cattle are always pretty much the same, as they
afford the same uses in life, where no new inventions of tillage or
pasturage cause a greater quantity in proportion to the demand.’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt074" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt074_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
</div>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_147">Lowering and raising the coins are unjust and pernicious operations. Copious mines abate the value of the precious metals.</p>
<div class="cit">
<p id="Smith_0206-01_148">‘The standard itself is varying insensibly;
and therefore if we would settle fixed salaries which in all events
would answer the same purposes of life, or support those entituled to
them in the same condition with respect to others, they should neither
be fixed in the legal names of coin, nor in a certain number of ounces
of gold and silver. A decree of state may change the legal names; and
the value of the ounces may alter by the increase or decrease of the
quantities of these metals. Nor should such salaries be fixed in any
quantities of more ingenious manufactures, for nice contrivances to
facilitate labour may lower the value of such goods. The most invariable
 salary would be so many days labour of men, or a fixed quantity of
goods produced by the plain inartificial labours, such goods as answer
the ordinary purposes of life. Quantities of grain come nearest to such a
 standard.’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt075" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt075_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
</div>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_149">Prices of goods depend upon the expenses, the
interest of money employed, and the ‘labours too, the care, attention,
accounts and correspondence about them’. Sometimes we must ‘take in also
 the condition of the person so employed,’ since ‘the expense of his
station of life must be defrayed by the price of such labours; and they
deserve compensation as much as any other. This additional price of
their labours is the just foundation of the ordinary profit of
merchants.’</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_150">In the next chapter, on ‘The Principal
Contracts in a Social Life,’ we find the rent or hire of unfruitful
goods, such as houses, justified on the ground that the proprietor might
 have employed his money or labour on goods naturally fruitful.</p>
<div class="cit">
<p id="Smith_0206-01_151">‘If in any way of trade men can make far
greater gains by help of a large stock of money than they could have
made without it, ’tis but just that he who supplies them with the money,
 the necessary means of this gain, should have for the use of it some
share of the profit, equal at least to the profit he could have made by
purchasing things naturally fruitful or yielding a rent. This shows the
just foundation of interest upon money lent, though it be not naturally
fruitful. Houses yield no fruits or increase, nor will some arable
grounds yield any without great labour. Labour employed in managing <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>xxxix<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 money in trade or manufactures will make it as fruitful as anything.
Were interest prohibited, none would lend except in charity; and many
industrious hands who are not objects of charity would be excluded from
large gains in a way very advantageous to the public.’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt076" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt076_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
</div>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_152">Reasonable interest varies with the state of
trade and the quantity of coin. In a newly settled country great profits
 are made by small sums, and land is worth fewer years’ purchase, so
that a higher interest is reasonable. Laws in settling interest must
follow ‘these natural causes,’ otherwise they will be evaded.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt077" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt077_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_153">In the chapter ‘Of the Nature of Civil Laws
and their Execution,’ we find that after piety the virtues most
necessary to a state are sobriety, industry, justice and fortitude.</p>
<div class="cit">
<p id="Smith_0206-01_154">‘Industry is the natural mine of wealth, the
fund of all stores for exportation by the surplus of which beyond the
value of what a nation imports, it must increase in wealth and power.
Diligent agriculture must furnish the necessaries of life and the
materials for all manufactures; and all mechanic arts should be
encouraged to prepare them for use and exportation. Goods prepared for
export should generally be free from all burdens and taxes, and so
should the goods be which are necessarily consumed by the artificers, as
 much as possible; that no other country be able to undersell like goods
 at a foreign market. Where one country alone has certain materials,
they may safely impose duties upon them when exported; but such moderate
 ones as shall not prevent the consumption of them abroad.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_155">‘If people have not acquired an habit of
industry, the cheapness of all the necessaries of life rather encourages
 sloth. The best remedy is to raise the demand for all necessaries; not
merely by premiums upon exporting them, which is often useful too; but
by increasing the number of people who consume them; and when they are
dear, more labour and application will be requisite in all trades and
arts to procure them. Industrious foreigners should therefore be invited
 to us, and all men of industry should live with us unmolested and easy.
 Encouragement should be given to marriage and to those who rear a
numerous offspring to industry. The unmarried should pay higher taxes as
 they are not at the charge of rearing new subjects to the state. Any
foolish notions of meanness in mechanic arts, as if they were unworthy
of men of better families, should be borne down, and men of better
condition as to birth or fortune engaged to be concerned in such
occupations. Sloth should be punished by temporary servitude at least.
Foreign materials should be imported and even premiums given, when
necessary, that all our own hands may be employed; and that, by
exporting them again manufactured, we may obtain from abroad the price
of our labours. Foreign manufactures and products ready for consumption
should be made dear to the consumer by high duties, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>xl<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 if we cannot altogether prohibit the consumption; that they may never
be used by the lower and more numerous orders of the people whose
consumption would be far greater than those of the few who are wealthy.
Navigation, or the carriage of goods foreign or domestic, should be
encouraged, as a gainful branch of business surpassing often all the
profit made by the merchant. This too is a nursery of fit hands for
defence at sea.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_156">‘ ’Tis vain to allege that luxury and
intemperance are necessary to the wealth of a state as they encourage
all labour and manufactures by making a great consumption. It is plain
there is no necessary vice in the consuming of the finest products or
the wearing of the dearest manufactures by persons whose fortunes can
allow it consistently with the duties of life. And what if men grew
generally more frugal and abstemious in such things? more of these finer
 goods could be sent abroad; or if they could not, industry and wealth
might be equally promoted by the greater consumption of goods less
chargeable: as he who saves by abating of his own expensive splendour
could by generous offices to his friends, and by some wise methods of
charity to the poor, enable others to live so much better and make
greater consumption than was made formerly by the luxury of one. . . .
Unless therefore a nation can be found where all men are already
provided with all the necessaries and conveniencies of life abundantly,
men may, without any luxury, make the very greatest consumption by
plentiful provision for their children, by generosity and liberality to
kinsmen and indigent men of worth, and by compassion to the distresses
of the poor.’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt078" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt078_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
</div>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_157">Under ‘Military skill and fortitude’ Hutcheson
 discusses what Adam Smith afterwards placed under ‘Arms,’ and decides
in favour of a trained militia.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt079" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt079_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_158">In the same chapter he has a section with the
marginal title ‘what taxes or tributes most eligible,’ which contains a
repudiation of the policy of taxation for revenue only:—</p>
<div class="cit">
<p id="Smith_0206-01_159">‘As to taxes for defraying the public
expenses, these are most convenient which are laid on matters of luxury
and splendour rather than the necessaries of life; on foreign products
and manufactures rather than domestic; and such as can be easily raised
without many expensive offices for collecting them. But above all, a
just proportion to the wealth of people should be observed in whatever
is raised from them, otherways than by duties upon foreign products and
manufactures, for such duties are often necessary to encourage industry
at home, though there were no public expenses.’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt080" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt080_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
</div>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_160">This proportionment of taxation to wealth he
thinks cannot be attained except by means of periodical estimation of
the wealth of families, since land taxes unduly oppress landlords in
debt and let <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>xli<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 moneyed men go free, while duties and excises are paid by the consumer,
 so that ‘hospitable generous men or such as have numerous families
supported genteelly bear the chief burden here, and the solitary sordid
miser bears little or no share of it’.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt081" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt081_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_161">It is quite clear from all this that Smith was
 largely influenced by the traditions of his chair in selecting his
economic subjects. Dr. Scott draws attention to the curious fact that
the very order in which the subjects happen to occur in Hutcheson’s <span class="ital">System</span> is almost identical with the order in which the same subjects occur in Smith’s <span class="ital">Lectures.</span><a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt082" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt082_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 We are strongly tempted to surmise that when Smith had hurriedly to
prepare his lectures for Craigie’s class, he looked through his notes of
 his old master’s lectures (as hundreds of men in his position have done
 before and after him) and grouped the economic subjects together as an
introduction and sequel to the lectures which he had brought with him
from Edinburgh. Hutcheson was an inspiring teacher. His colleague,
Leechman, says:—</p>
<div class="cit">
<p id="Smith_0206-01_162">‘As he had occasion every year in the course
of his lectures to explain the origin of government and compare the
different forms of it, he took peculiar care, while on that subject, to
inculcate the importance of civil and religious liberty to the happiness
 of mankind: as a warm love of liberty and manly zeal for promoting it
were ruling principles in his own breast, he always insisted upon it at
great length and with the greatest strength of argument and earnestness
of persuasion: and he had such success on this important point, that
few, if any, of his pupils, whatever contrary prejudices they might
bring along with them, ever left him without favourable notions of that
side of the question which he espoused and defended’.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt083" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt083_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
</div>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_163">Half a century later Adam Smith spoke of the
Glasgow Chair of Moral Philosophy as an ‘office to which the abilities
and virtues of the never-to-be-forgotten Dr. Hutcheson had given a
superior degree of illustration’.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt084" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt084_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_164">But while we may well believe that Adam Smith
was influenced in the general direction of liberalism by Hutcheson,
there seems no reason for attributing to Hutcheson’s influence the
belief in the economic beneficence of self-interest which permeates the <span class="ital">Wealth of Nations</span> and has afforded a starting ground for economic speculation <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>xlii<span class="bracket">]</span></span> ever since. Hutcheson, as some of the passages just quoted show, was a mercantilist, and all the economic teaching in his <span class="ital">System</span>
 is very dry bones compared to Smith’s vigourous lectures on Cheapness
or Plenty, with their often repeated denunciation of the ‘absurdity’ of
current opinions and the ‘pernicious regulations’ to which they gave
rise. Twenty years after attending his lectures, Adam Smith criticised
Hutcheson expressly on the ground that he thought too little of
self-love. In the chapter of the <span class="ital">Theory of Moral Sentiments</span>
 on the systems of philosophy which make virtue consist in benevolence,
he says that Hutcheson believed that it was benevolence only which could
 stamp upon any action the character of virtue: the most benevolent
action was that which aimed at the good of the largest number of people,
 and self-love was a principle which could never be virtuous, though it
was innocent when it had no other effect than to make the individual
take care of his own happiness. This ‘amiable system, a system which has
 a peculiar tendency to nourish and support in the human heart the
noblest and the most agreeable of all affections,’ Smith considered to
have the ‘defect of not sufficiently explaining from whence arises our
approbation of the inferior virtues of prudence, vigilance,
circumspection, temperance, constancy, firmness’.</p>
<div class="cit">
<p id="Smith_0206-01_165">‘Regard,’ he continues, ‘to our own private
happiness and interest too, appear upon many occasions very laudable
principles of action. The habits of œconomy, industry, discretion,
attention and application of thought, are generally supposed to be
cultivated from self-interested motives, and at the same time are
apprehended to be very praise-worthy qualities which deserve the esteem
and approbation of every body. . . . Carelessness and want of œconomy
are universally disapproved of, not, however, as proceeding from a want
of benevolence, but from a want of the proper attention to the objects
of self-interest.’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt085" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt085_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
</div>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_166">Adam Smith clearly believed that Hutcheson’s
system did not give a sufficiently high place to self-interest. It was
not Hutcheson that inspired his remark, ‘it is not from the benevolence
of the butcher, the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner, but
from their regard to their own interest’.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt086" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt086_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 He may have obtained a general love of liberty from Hutcheson, but
whence did he obtain the belief that self-interest works for the benefit
 of the whole <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>xliii<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 economic community? He might possibly of course have evolved it
entirely in his own mind without even hearing another lecture or reading
 another book after he left Hutcheson’s class. But it seems probable—we
cannot safely say more—that he was assisted by his study of Mandeville, a
 writer who has had little justice done him in histories of economics,
though McCulloch gives a useful hint on the subject in his <span class="ital">Literature of Political Economy.</span> In the chapter of the <span class="ital">Moral Sentiments</span>
 which follows the one which contains the criticism of Hutcheson just
quoted, Smith deals with ‘Licentious Systems’. The appearances in human
nature, he says, which seem at first sight to favour such systems were
‘slightly sketched out with the elegance and delicate precision of the
duke of Rochefaucault, and afterwards more fully represented with the
lively and humorous, though coarse and rustic eloquence of Dr.
Mandeville’.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt087" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt087_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_167">Mandeville, he says, attributes all
commendable acts to ‘a love of praise and commendation,’ or ‘vanity,’
and not content with that, endeavours to point out the imperfection of
human virtue in many other respects.</p>
<div class="cit">
<p id="Smith_0206-01_168">‘Wherever our reserve with regard to pleasure
falls short of the most ascetic abstinence, he treats it as gross luxury
 and sensuality. Every thing according to him, is luxury which exceeds
what is absolutely necessary for the support of human nature, so that
there is vice even in the use of a clean shirt or of a convenient
habitation.’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt088" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt088_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
</div>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_169">But, Smith thinks, he has fallen into the
great fallacy of representing every passion as wholly vicious if it is
so in any degree and direction:—</p>
<div class="cit">
<p id="Smith_0206-01_170">‘It is thus that he treats everything as
vanity which has any reference either to what are or to what ought to be
 the sentiments of others: and it is by means of this sophistry that he
establishes his favourite conclusion that private vices are public
benefits. If the love of magnificence, a taste for the elegant arts and
improvements of human life, for whatever is agreeable in dress,
furniture, or equipage, for architecture, statuary, painting and music,
is to be regarded as luxury, sensuality and ostentation, even in those
whose situation allows, without any inconveniency, the indulgence of
those passions, it is certain that luxury, sensuality and ostentation
are public benefits: since, without the qualities upon which he thinks
proper to bestow such opprobrious names, the arts of refinement could
never find encouragement and must languish for want of employment.’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt089" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt089_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
</div>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>xliv<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_171">‘Such,’ Smith concludes, ‘is the system of Dr.
 Mandeville, which once made so much noise in the world.’ However
destructive it might appear, he thought ‘it could never have imposed
upon so great a number of persons, nor have occasioned so general an
alarm among those who are friends of better principles, had it not in
some respects bordered upon the truth’.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt090" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt090_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_172">Mandeville’s work originally consisted merely
of a poem of 400 lines called ‘The Grumbling Hive: or Knaves Turn’d
Honest,’ which according to his own account was first published as a
six-penny pamphlet about 1705.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt091" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt091_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> In 1714 he reprinted it, appending a very much larger quantity of prose, under the title of <span class="ital">The
 Fable of the Bees: or Private Vices, Public Benefits; with an Essay on
Charity and Charity Schools and a Search into the Nature of Society.</span>
 In 1729 he added further a second part, nearly as large as the first,
consisting of a dialogue on the subject. The ‘grumbling hive,’ which is
in reality a human society, is described in the poem as prospering
greatly so long as it was full of vice:—</p>

<p id="Smith_0206-01_211">But the bees grumbled till Jove in anger swore
 he would rid the hive of fraud. The hive became virtuous, frugal and
honest, and trade was forthwith ruined by the cessation of expenditure.
At the end of the ‘Search into the Nature of Society’ the author sums up
 his conclusion as follows:—</p>
<div class="cit">
<p id="Smith_0206-01_212">‘After this I flatter myself to have
demonstrated that neither the friendly qualities and kind affections
that are natural to man, nor the real virtues he is capable of acquiring
 by reason and self-denial, are the foundation of society: but that what
 we call evil in the world, moral as well as natural, is the grand
principle that makes us sociable creatures, the solid basis, the life
and support of all trades and employments without exception: that there
we must look for the true origin of all arts and sciences, and that the
moment evil ceases the society must be spoiled, if not totally
dissolved.’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt093" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt093_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
</div>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_213">In a letter to the <span class="ital">London Journal</span>
 of 10th August, 1723, which he reprinted in the edition of 1724,
Mandeville defended this passage vigorously against a hostile critic.
If, he said, he had been writing to be understood by the meanest
capacities, he would have explained that every want was an evil:—</p>
<div class="cit">
<p id="Smith_0206-01_214">‘That on the multiplicity of those wants
depended all those mutual services which the individual members of a
society pay to each other: and that consequently, the greater variety
there was of wants, the larger number of individuals might find their
private interest in labouring for the good of others, and united
together, compose one body.’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt094" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt094_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
</div>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>xlvi<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_215">If we bear in mind Smith’s criticism of Hutcheson and Mandeville in adjoining chapters of the <span class="ital">Moral Sentiments,</span> and remember further that he must almost certainly have become acquainted with the <span class="ital">Fable of the Bees</span>
 when attending Hutcheson’s lectures or soon afterwards, we can scarcely
 fail to suspect that it was Mandeville who first made him realise that
‘it is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer or the baker
that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest’.
 Treating the word ‘vice’ as a mistake for self-love, Adam Smith could
have repeated with cordiality Mandeville’s lines already quoted:—</p>
<ul class="poem">
<li class="indent-yes" id="Smith_0206-01_216">‘Thus vice nursed ingenuity,</li>
<li id="Smith_0206-01_217">Which join’d with time and industry,</li>

<li id="Smith_0206-01_219">It’s real pleasures, comforts, ease,</li>
<li id="Smith_0206-01_220">To such a height, the very poor</li>
<li id="Smith_0206-01_221">Lived better than the rich before.’</li>
</ul>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_222">Smith put the doggerel into prose, and added
something from the Hutchesonian love of liberty when he propounded what
is really the text of the polemical portion of the <span class="ital">Wealth of Nations:</span>—</p>
<div class="cit">
<p id="Smith_0206-01_223">‘The natural effort of every individual to
better his own condition, when suffered to exert itself with freedom and
 security, is so powerful a principle, that it is alone and without any
assistance, not only capable of carrying on the society to wealth and
prosperity, but of surmounting a hundred impertinent obstructions with
which the folly of human laws too often incumbers its operations.’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt095" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt095_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
</div>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_224">Experience shows that a general belief in the
beneficence of the economic working of self-interest is not always
sufficient to make even a person of more than average intelligence a
free-trader. Consequently it would be rash to suppose that Smith’s
disbelief in the mercantile system was merely the natural outcome of his
 general belief in economic freedom. Dugald Stewart’s quotations from
his paper of 1755 do not contain anything to show that he was pouring
contempt on the doctrine before he left Edinburgh and in his early years
 at Glasgow. It seems very likely that the reference in the lectures to
Hume’s ‘essays showing the absurdity of these and other such doctrines’<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt096" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt096_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> is to be regarded as an acknowledgment <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>xlvii<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of obligation, and therefore that it was Hume, by his <span class="ital">Political Discourses</span>
 on Money and the Balance of Trade in 1752, who first opened Adam
Smith’s eyes on this subject. The probability of this is slightly
increased by the fact that in the lectures the mercantile fallacies as
to the balance of trade were discussed in connexion with Money, as in
Hume’s <span class="ital">Discourses,</span> instead of in the position
which they would have occupied if Smith had either followed Hutcheson’s
order, or placed them among the causes of the ‘slow progress of
opulence’. It is, too, perhaps, not a mere coincidence that while both
Hume in the <span class="ital">Discourses</span> in 1752 and Smith in
his lectures ten years later rejected altogether the aim of securing a
favourable balance of trade, Hume still clearly believed in the utility
of protection for home industries, and Smith is at any rate reported to
have made a considerable concession in its favour.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt097" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt097_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_225">It would be useless to carry the inquiry into
the origin of Adam Smith’s views any further here. Perhaps it has been
carried too far already. In the course of the <span class="ital">Wealth of Nations</span>
 Smith actually quotes by their own name or that of their authors almost
 one hundred books. An attentive study of the notes to the present
edition will convince the reader that though a few of these are quoted
at second hand the number actually used was far greater. Usually but
little, sometimes only a single fact, phrase or opinion, is taken from
each, so that few authors are less open than Adam Smith to the reproach
of having rifled another man’s work. That charge has indeed never
seriously been brought against him, except in regard to Turgot’s <span class="ital">Réflexions,</span>
 and in that case not a particle of evidence has ever been produced to
show that he had used or even seen the book in question. The <span class="ital">Wealth of Nations</span>
 was not written hastily with the impressions of recent reading still
vivid on the author’s brain. Its composition was spread over at least
the twenty-seven years from 1749 to 1776. During that period economic
ideas crossed and recrossed the Channel many times, and it is as useless
 as it is invidious to dispute about the relative shares of Great <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>xlviii<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 Britain and France in the progress effected. To go further and attempt
to apportion the merit between different authors is like standing on
some beach and discussing whether this or that particular wave had most
to do with the rising tide. One wave may appear to have what credit
there is in sweeping over a child’s first sand castle and another wave
may evidently wipe out his second, but both would have been swamped just
 as effectually, and almost as soon, on a perfectly calm day.</p>

<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-01_226">THE annual<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt098" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt098_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> labour of every nation is the fund which originally<span class="type-margin"><span>The produce of annual labour supplies annual consumption,</span></span> supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniencies of life<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt099" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt099_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 which it annually consumes, and which consist always either in the
immediate produce of that labour, or in what is purchased with that
produce from other nations.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_227">According therefore, as this produce, or what is purchased with it,<span class="type-margin"><span>better or worse according to the proportion of produce to people,</span></span>
 bears a greater or smaller proportion to the number of those who are to
 consume it, the nation will be better or worse supplied with all the
necessaries and conveniencies for which it has occasion.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt100" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt100_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_228">But this proportion must in every nation be regulated by two<span class="type-margin"><span>which proportion is regulated by the skill, etc., of the labour and the proportion of useful labourers,</span></span> different circumstances; first, by the skill, dexterity, and judgment with which its labour is generally applied;<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt101" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt101_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 and, secondly, by the proportion between the number of those who are
employed in useful labour, and that of those who are not so employed.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt102" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt102_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a> Whatever be <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>2<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 the soil, climate, or extent of territory of any particular nation, the
 abundance or scantiness of its annual supply must, in that particular
situation, depend upon those two circumstances.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_229"><span class="type-margin"><span>and more by
the skill, etc., than by the proportion of useful labourers, as is shown
 by the greater produce of civilised societies.</span></span>The
abundance or scantiness of this supply too seems to depend more upon the
 former of those two circumstances than upon the latter. Among the
savage nations of hunters and fishers, every individual who is able to
work, is more or less employed in useful labour, and endeavours to
provide, as well as he can, the necessaries and conveniencies of life,
for himself, or<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt103" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt103_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 such of his family or tribe as are either too old, or too young, or too
 infirm to go a hunting and fishing. Such nations, however, are so
miserably poor, that from mere want, they are frequently reduced, or, at
 least, think themselves reduced, to the necessity sometimes of directly
 destroying, and sometimes of abandoning their infants, their old
people, and those afflicted with lingering diseases, to perish with
hunger, or to be devoured by wild beasts. Among civilized and thriving
nations, on the contrary, though a great number of people do not labour
at all, many of whom consume the produce of ten times, frequently of a
hundred times more labour than the greater part of those who work; yet
the produce of the whole labour of the society is so great, that all are
 often abundantly supplied, and a workman, even of the lowest and
poorest order, if he is frugal and industrious, may enjoy a greater
share of the necessaries and conveniencies of life than it is possible
for any savage to acquire.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_230"><span class="type-margin"><span>The causes of improvement and natural distribution are the subject of Book I.</span></span>The causes<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt104" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt104_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> of this improvement, in the productive powers of labour, and the order, according to which its produce is naturally distributed<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt105" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt105_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> among the different ranks and conditions of men in the society, make the subject of the First Book of this Inquiry.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_231"><span class="type-margin"><span>Capital stock, which regulates the proportion of useful labourers, is treated of in Book II.</span></span>Whatever
 be the actual state of the skill, dexterity, and judgment with which
labour is applied in any nation, the abundance or scantiness of its
annual supply must depend, during the continuance of that state, upon
the proportion between the number of those who are annually employed in
useful labour, and that of those who are not so employed. The number of
useful and productive<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt106" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt106_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 labourers, it will hereafter appear, is every where in proportion to
the quantity of capital stock which is employed in setting them to work,
 and to the particular way in which it is so employed. The Second Book,
therefore, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>3<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 treats of the nature of capital stock, of the manner in which it is
gradually accumulated, and of the different quantities of labour which
it puts into motion, according to the different ways in which it is
employed.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_232">Nations tolerably well advanced as to skill, dexterity, and judgment,<span class="type-margin"><span>The circumstances which led Europe to encourage the industry of the towns and discourage agriculture are dealt with in Book III.</span></span>
 in the application of labour, have followed very different plans in the
 general conduct or direction of it; and those plans have not all been
equally favourable to the greatness of its produce. The policy of some
nations has given extraordinary encouragement to the industry of the
country; that of others to the industry of towns. Scarce any nation has
dealt equally and impartially with every sort of industry. Since the
downfal of the Roman empire, the policy of Europe has been more
favourable to arts, manufactures, and commerce, the industry of towns;
than to agriculture, the industry of the country. The circumstances
which seem to have introduced and established this policy are explained
in the Third Book.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_233">Though those different plans were, perhaps, first introduced by the<span class="type-margin"><span>The theories to which different policies have given rise are explained in Book IV.</span></span>
 private interests and prejudices of particular orders of men, without
any regard to, or foresight of, their consequences upon the general
welfare of the society; yet they have given occasion to very different
theories of political œconomy;<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt107" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt107_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 of which some magnify the importance of that industry which is carried
on in towns, others of that which is carried on in the country. Those
theories have had a considerable influence, not only upon the opinions
of men of learning, but upon the public conduct of princes and sovereign
 states. I have endeavoured, in the Fourth Book, to explain, as fully
and distinctly as I can, those different theories, and the principal
effects which they have produced in different ages and nations.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_234">To explain<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt108" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt108_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> in what has consisted the revenue of the great body<span class="type-margin"><span>The expenditure, revenue and debts of the sovereign are treated of in Book V.</span></span> of the people, or what has been the nature<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt109" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt109_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> of those funds, which, in different ages and nations, have supplied their annual consumption, is the object of<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt110" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt110_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 these Four first Books. The Fifth and last Book treats of the revenue
of the sovereign, or commonwealth. In this book I have endeavoured to
show; first, what are the necessary expences of the sovereign, or
commonwealth; which of those expences ought to be defrayed by the
general contribution of the whole society; and which of them, by that of
 some particular part only, or of some particular members of it:<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt111" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt111_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a> secondly, what are the different methods <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>4<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 in which the whole society may be made to contribute towards defraying
the expences incumbent on the whole society, and what are the principal
advantages and inconveniencies of each of those methods: and, thirdly
and lastly, what are the reasons and causes which have induced almost
all modern governments to mortgage some part of this revenue, or to
contract debts, and what have been the effects of those debts upon the
real wealth, the annual produce of the land and labour of the society.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt112" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt112_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>

 and the greater part of the skill, dexterity, and judgment with which
it is any where directed, or applied, seem to have been the effects of
the division of labour.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_236">The effects of the division of labour, in the general business of<span class="type-margin"><span>as may be better understood from a particular example,</span></span>
 society, will be more easily understood, by considering in what manner
it operates in some particular manufactures. It is commonly supposed to
be carried furthest in some very trifling ones; not perhaps that it <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>6<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 really is carried further in them than in others of more importance:
but in those trifling manufactures which are destined to supply the
small wants of but a small number of people, the whole number of workmen
 must necessarily be small; and those employed in every different branch
 of the work can often be collected into the same workhouse, and placed
at once under the view of the spectator. In those great manufactures, on
 the contrary, which are destined to supply the great wants of the great
 body of the people, every different branch of the work employs so great
 a number of workmen, that it is impossible to collect them all into the
 same workhouse. We can seldom see more, at one time, than those
employed in one single branch. Though in such manufactures,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt115" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt115_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 therefore, the work may really be divided into a much greater number of
 parts, than in those of a more trifling nature, the division is not
near so obvious, and has accordingly been much less observed.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_237"><span class="type-margin"><span>such as pin-making.</span></span>To take an example, therefore,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt116" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt116_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 from a very trifling manufacture; but one in which the division of
labour has been very often taken notice of, the trade of the pin-maker; a
 workman not educated to this business (which the division of labour has
 rendered a distinct trade),<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt117" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt117_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 nor acquainted with the use of the machinery employed in it (to the
invention of which the same division of labour has probably given
occasion), could scarce, perhaps, with his utmost industry, make one pin
 in a day, and certainly could not make twenty. But in the way in which
this business is now carried on, not only the whole work is a peculiar
trade, but it is divided into a number of branches, of which the greater
 part are likewise peculiar trades. One man draws out the wire, another
straights it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, a fifth grinds it at
the top for receiving the head; to make the head requires two or three
distinct operations; to put it on, is a peculiar business, to whiten the
 pins is another; it is even a trade by itself to put them into the
paper; and the important business of making a pin is, in this manner,
divided into about eighteen distinct operations, which, in some
manufactories, are all performed by distinct hands, though in others the
 same man will sometimes perform two or three of them.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt118" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt118_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> I have seen a small manufactory of this kind <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>7<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 where ten men only were employed, and where some of them consequently
performed two or three distinct operations. But though they were very
poor, and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary
machinery, they could, when they exerted themselves, make among them
about twelve pounds of pins in a day. There are in a pound upwards of
four thousand pins of a middling size. Those ten persons, therefore,
could make among them upwards of forty-eight thousand pins in a day.
Each person, therefore, making a tenth part of forty-eight thousand
pins, might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a
 day. But if they had all wrought separately and independently, and
without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business, they
 certainly could not each of them have made twenty, perhaps not one pin
in a day; that is, certainly, not the two hundred and fortieth, perhaps
not the four thousand eight hundredth part of what they are at present
capable of performing, in consequence of a proper division and
combination of their different operations.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_238">In every other art and manufacture, the effects of the division of<span class="type-margin"><span>The effect is similar in all trades and also in the division of employments.</span></span>
 labour are similar to what they are in this very trifling one; though,
in many of them, the labour can neither be so much subdivided, nor
reduced to so great a simplicity of operation. The division of labour,
however, so far as it can be introduced, occasions, in every art, a
proportionable increase of the productive powers of labour. The
separation of different trades and employments from one another, seems
to have taken place, in consequence of this advantage. This separation
too is generally carried furthest in those countries which enjoy the
highest degree of industry and improvement; what is the work of one man
in a rude state of society, being generally that of several in an
improved one. In every improved society, the farmer is generally nothing
 but a farmer; the manufacturer, nothing but a manufacturer. The labour
too which is necessary to produce any one complete manufacture, is
almost always divided among a great number of hands. How many different
trades are employed in each branch of the linen and woollen
manufactures, from the growers of the flax and the wool, to the
bleachers and smoothers of the linen, or to the dyers and dressers of
the cloth! The nature of agriculture, indeed, does not admit of so many
subdivisions of labour, nor of so complete a separation of one business
from another, as manufactures. <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>8<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 It is impossible to separate so entirely, the business of the grazier
from that of the corn-farmer, as the trade of the carpenter is commonly
separated from that of the smith. The spinner is almost always a
distinct person from the weaver; but the ploughman, the harrower, the
sower of the seed, and the reaper of the corn, are often the same. The
occasions for those different sorts of labour returning with the
different seasons of the year, it is impossible that one man should be
constantly employed in any one of them. This impossibility of making so
complete and entire a separation of all the different branches of labour
 employed in agriculture, is perhaps the reason why the improvement of
the productive powers of labour in this art, does not always keep pace
with their improvement in manufactures. The most opulent nations,
indeed, generally excel all their neighbours in agriculture as well as
in manufactures; but they are commonly more distinguished by their
superiority in the latter than in the former. Their lands are in general
 better cultivated, and having more labour and expence bestowed upon
them, produce more in proportion to the extent and natural fertility of
the ground. But this<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt119" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt119_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 superiority of produce is seldom much more than in proportion to the
superiority of labour and expence. In agriculture, the labour of the
rich country is not always much more productive than that of the poor;
or, at least, it is never so much more productive, as it commonly is in
manufactures. The corn of the rich country, therefore, will not always,
in the same degree of goodness, come cheaper to market than that of the
poor. The corn of Poland, in the same degree of goodness, is as cheap as
 that of France, notwithstanding the superior opulence and improvement
of the latter country. The corn of France is, in the corn provinces,
fully as good, and in most years nearly about the same price with the
corn of England, though, in opulence and improvement, France is perhaps
inferior to England. The corn-lands of England, however, are better
cultivated than those of France, and the corn-lands<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt120" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt120_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 of France are said to be much better cultivated than those of Poland.
But though the poor country, notwithstanding the inferiority of its
cultivation, can, in some measure, rival the rich in the cheapness and
goodness of its corn, it can pretend to no such competition in its
manufactures; at least if those manufactures suit the soil, climate, and
 situation of the rich country. The silks of France are better and
cheaper than those of England, because the silk manufacture, at least
under the present high duties upon the importation of raw silk, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>9<span class="bracket">]</span></span> does not so well suit the climate of England as that of France.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt121" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt121_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 But the hard-ware and the coarse woollens of England are beyond all
comparison superior to those of France, and much cheaper too in the same
 degree of goodness.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt122" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt122_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 In Poland there are said to be scarce any manufactures of any kind, a
few of those coarser household manufactures excepted, without which no
country can well subsist.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_239">This great increase of the quantity of work, which, in consequence<span class="type-margin"><span>The advantage is due to three circumstances,</span></span> of the division of labour, the same number of people are capable of performing,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt123" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt123_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 is owing to three different circumstances; first, to the increase of
dexterity in every particular workman; secondly, to the saving of the
time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to
another; and lastly, to the invention of a great number of machines
which facilitate and abridge labour, and enable one man to do the work
of many.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt124" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt124_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_240">First, the improvement of the dexterity of the workman necessarily<span class="type-margin"><span>(1) improved dexterity,</span></span>
 increases the quantity of the work he can perform; and the division of
labour, by reducing every man’s business to some one simple operation,
and by making this operation the sole employment of his life,
necessarily increases very much the dexterity of the workman. A common
smith, who, though accustomed to handle the hammer, has never been used
to make nails, if upon some particular occasion he is obliged to attempt
 it, will scarce, I am assured, be able to make above two or three
hundred nails in a day, and those too very bad ones.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt125" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt125_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a>
 A smith who has been accustomed to make nails, but whose sole or
principal business has not been that of a nailer, can seldom with his
utmost diligence make more than eight hundred or a thousand nails in a
day. I have seen several boys under twenty years of age who had never
exercised any other trade but that of making nails, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>10<span class="bracket">]</span></span> and who, when they exerted themselves, could make, each of them, upwards of two thousand three hundred nails in a day.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt126" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt126_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The making of a nail, however, is by no means one of the simplest
operations. The same person blows the bellows, stirs or mends the fire
as there is occasion, heats the iron, and forges every part of the nail:
 In forging the head too he is obliged to change his tools. The
different operations into which the making of a pin, or of a metal
button,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt127" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt127_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 is subdivided, are all of them much more simple, and the dexterity of
the person, of whose life it has been the sole business to perform them,
 is usually much greater. The rapidity with which some of the operations
 of those manufactures are performed, exceeds what the human hand could,
 by those who had never seen them, be supposed capable of acquiring.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_241"><span class="type-margin"><span>(2) saving of time,</span></span>Secondly,
 the advantage which is gained by saving the time commonly lost in
passing from one sort of work to another, is much greater than we should
 at first view be apt to imagine it. It is impossible to pass very
quickly from one kind of work to another, that is carried on in a
different place, and with quite different tools. A country weaver,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt128" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt128_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 who cultivates a small farm, must lose a good deal of time in passing
from his loom to the field, and from the field to his loom. When the two
 trades can be carried on in the same workhouse, the loss of time is no
doubt much less. It is even in this case, however, very considerable. A
man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of
employment to another. When he first begins the new work he is seldom
very keen and hearty; his mind, as they say, does not go to it, and for
some time he rather trifles than applies to good purpose. The habit of
sauntering and of indolent careless application, which is naturally, or
rather necessarily acquired by every country workman who is obliged to
change his work and his tools every half hour, and to apply his hand in
twenty different ways almost every day of his life; renders him almost
always slothful and lazy, and incapable of any vigorous application even
 on the most pressing occasions. Independent, therefore, of his
deficiency in point of dexterity, this cause alone must always reduce
considerably the quantity of work which he is capable of performing.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_242"><span class="type-margin"><span>and (3) application of machinery, invented by workmen,</span></span>Thirdly,
 and lastly, every body must be sensible how much labour is facilitated
and abridged by the application of proper machinery. <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>11<span class="bracket">]</span></span> It is unnecessary to give any example.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt129" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt129_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> I shall only observe, therefore,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt130" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt130_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 that the invention of all those machines by which labour is so much
facilitated and abridged, seems to have been originally owing to the
division of labour. Men are much more likely to discover easier and
readier methods of attaining any object, when the whole attention of
their minds is directed towards that single object, than when it is
dissipated among a great variety of things. But in consequence of the
division of labour, the whole of every man’s attention comes naturally
to be directed towards some one very simple object. It is naturally to
be expected, therefore, that some one or other of those who are employed
 in each particular branch of labour should soon find out easier and
readier methods of performing their own particular work, wherever the
nature of it admits of such improvement. A great part of the machines
made use of<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt131" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt131_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 in those manufactures in which labour is most subdivided, were
originally the inventions of common workmen, who, being each of them
employed in some very simple operation, naturally turned their thoughts
towards finding out easier and readier methods of performing it. Whoever
 has been much accustomed to visit such manufactures, must frequently
have been shewn very pretty machines, which were the inventions of such<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt132" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt132_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> workmen, in order to facilitate and quicken their own particular part of the work. In the first fire-engines,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt133" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt133_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a>
 a boy was constantly employed to open and shut alternately the
communication between the boiler and the cylinder, according as the
piston either ascended or descended. One of those boys, who loved to
play with his companions, observed that, by tying a string from the
handle of the valve which opened this communication to another part of
the machine, the valve would open and shut without his assistance, and
leave him at liberty to divert himself with his play-fellows. One of the
 greatest improvements that has been made upon this machine, since it
was first invented, was in this manner the discovery of a boy who wanted
 to save his own labour.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt134" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt134_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">6</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>12<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_243"><span class="type-margin"><span>or by machine-makers and philosophers.</span></span>All
 the improvements in machinery, however, have by no means been the
inventions of those who had occasion to use the machines. Many
improvements have been made by the ingenuity of the makers of the
machines, when to make them became the business of a peculiar trade; and
 some by that of those who are called philosophers or men of
speculation, whose trade it is not to do any thing, but to observe every
 thing; and who, upon that account, are often capable of combining
together the powers of the most distant and dissimilar objects.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt135" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt135_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 In the progress of society, philosophy or speculation becomes, like
every other employment, the principal or sole trade and occupation of a
particular class of citizens. Like every other employment too, it is
subdivided into a great number of different branches, each of which
affords occupation to a peculiar tribe or class of philosophers; and
this subdivision of employment in philosophy, as well as in every other
business, improves dexterity, and saves time. Each individual becomes
more expert in his own peculiar branch, more work is done upon the
whole, and the quantity of science is considerably increased by it.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt136" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt136_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_244"><span class="type-margin"><span>Hence the universal opulence of a well-governed society,</span></span>It
 is the great multiplication of the productions of all the different
arts, in consequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a
well-governed society, that universal opulence which extends itself to
the lowest ranks of the people. Every workman has a great quantity of
his own work to dispose of beyond what he himself has occasion for; and
every other workman being exactly in the same situation, he is enabled
to exchange a great quantity of his own goods for a great quantity, or,
what comes to the same thing, for the price of a <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>13<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 great quantity of theirs. He supplies them abundantly with what they
have occasion for, and they accommodate him as amply with what he has
occasion for, and a general plenty diffuses itself through all the
different ranks of the society.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_245">Observe the accommodation of the most common artificer or day-labourer<span class="type-margin"><span>even the day-labourer’s coat being the produce of a vast number of workmen.</span></span>
 in a civilized and thriving country, and you will perceive that the
number of people of whose industry a part, though but a small part, has
been employed in procuring him this accommodation, exceeds all
computation. The woollen coat, for example, which covers the
day-labourer, as coarse and rough as it may appear, is the produce of
the joint labour of a great multitude of workmen. The shepherd, the
sorter of the wool, the wool-comber or carder, the dyer, the scribbler,
the spinner, the weaver, the fuller, the dresser, with many others, must
 all join their different arts in order to complete even this homely
production. How many merchants and carriers, besides, must have been
employed in transporting the materials from some of those workmen to
others who often live in a very distant part of the country! how much
commerce and navigation in particular, how many ship-builders, sailors,
sail-makers, rope-makers, must have been employed in order to bring
together the different drugs made use of by the dyer, which often come
from the remotest corners of the world! What a variety of labour too is
necessary in order to produce the tools of the meanest of those workmen!
 To say nothing of such complicated machines as the ship of the sailor,
the mill of the fuller, or even the loom of the weaver, let us consider
only what a variety of labour is requisite in order to form that very
simple machine, the shears with which the shepherd clips the wool. The
miner, the builder of the furnace for smelting the ore, the feller of
the timber, the burner of the charcoal to be made use of in the
smelting-house, the brick-maker, the brick-layer, the workmen who attend
 the furnace, the mill-wright, the forger, the smith, must all of them
join their different arts in order to produce them. Were we to examine,
in the same manner, all the different parts of his dress and household
furniture, the coarse linen shirt which he wears next his skin, the
shoes which cover his feet, the bed which he lies on, and all the
different parts which compose it, the kitchen-grate at which he prepares
 his victuals, the coals which he makes use of for that purpose, dug
from the bowels of the earth, and brought to him perhaps by a long sea
and a long land carriage, all the other utensils of his kitchen, all the
 furniture of his table, the knives and forks, the earthen or pewter
plates upon which he serves up and divides his victuals, the different
hands employed in preparing his <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>14<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 bread and his beer, the glass window which lets in the heat and the
light, and keeps out the wind and the rain, with all the knowledge and
art requisite for preparing that beautiful and happy invention, without
which these northern parts of the world could scarce have afforded a
very comfortable habitation, together with the tools of all the
different workmen employed in producing those different conveniencies;
if we examine, I say, all these things, and consider what a variety of
labour is employed about each of them, we shall be sensible that without
 the assistance and co-operation of many thousands, the very meanest
person in a civilized country could not be provided, even according to,
what we very falsely imagine, the easy and simple manner in which he is
commonly accommodated. Compared, indeed, with the more extravagant
luxury of the great, his accommodation must no doubt appear extremely
simple and easy; and yet it may be true, perhaps, that the accommodation
 of an European prince does not always so much exceed that of an
industrious and frugal peasant, as the accommodation of the latter
exceeds that of many an African king, the absolute master of the lives
and liberties of ten thousand naked savages.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt137" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt137_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>

<h2 id="lf0206-01_label_179">CHAPTER II: OF THE PRINCIPLE WHICH GIVES OCCASION TO THE DIVISION OF LABOUR</h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-01_246">THIS division of labour, from which so many advantages are<span class="type-margin"><span>The division of labour arises from a propensity in human nature to exchange.</span></span>
 derived, is not originally the effect of any human wisdom, which
foresees and intends that general opulence to which it gives occasion.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt138" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt138_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 It is the necessary, though very slow and gradual, consequence of a
certain propensity in human nature which has in view no such extensive
utility; the propensity to truck, barter, and exchange one thing for
another.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_247">Whether this propensity be one of those original principles in human<span class="type-margin"><span>This propensity is found in man alone.</span></span>
 nature, of which no further account can be given; or whether, as seems
more probable, it be the necessary consequence of the faculties of
reason and speech, it belongs not to our present subject to enquire. It
is common to all men, and to be found in no other race of animals, which
 seem to know neither this nor any other species of contracts. Two
greyhounds, in running down the same hare, have sometimes the appearance
 of acting in some sort of concert. Each turns her towards his
companion, or endeavours to intercept her when his companion turns her
towards himself. This, however, is not the effect of any contract, but
of the accidental concurrence of their passions in the same object at
that particular time. Nobody ever saw a dog make a fair and deliberate
exchange of one bone for another with another dog.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt139" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt139_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 Nobody ever saw one animal by its gestures and natural cries signify to
 another, this is mine, that yours; I am willing to give this for that.
When an animal wants to obtain something either of a man or of another
animal, it has no other means of persuasion but to gain the favour of
those whose service it requires. A puppy fawns upon its <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>16<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 dam, and a spaniel endeavours by a thousand attractions to engage the
attention of its master who is at dinner, when it wants to be fed by
him. Man sometimes uses the same arts with his brethren, and when he has
 no other means of engaging them to act according to his inclinations,
endeavours by every servile and fawning attention to obtain their good
will. He has not time, however, to do this upon every occasion. In
civilized society he stands at all times in need of the co-operation and
 assistance of great multitudes, while his whole life is scarce
sufficient to gain the friendship of a few persons. In almost every
other race of animals each individual, when it is grown up to maturity,
is entirely<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt140" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt140_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 independent, and in its natural state has occasion for the assistance
of no other living creature. But man has almost constant occasion for
the help of his brethren, and it is in vain for him to expect it from
their benevolence only. He will be more likely to prevail if he can
interest their self-love in his favour, and shew them that it is for
their own advantage to do for him what he requires of them. Whoever
offers to another a bargain of any kind, proposes to do this: Give me
that which I want, and you shall have this which you want, is the
meaning of every such offer; and it is in this manner that we obtain
from one another the far greater part of those good offices which we
stand in need of. It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the
brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard
to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but
to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of
 their advantages. Nobody but a beggar chuses to depend chiefly upon the
 benevolence of his fellow-citizens. Even a beggar does not depend upon
it entirely. The charity of well-disposed people, indeed, supplies him
with the whole fund of his subsistence. But though this principle
ultimately provides him with all the necessaries of life which he has
occasion for, it neither does nor can provide him with them as he has
occasion for them. The greater part of his occasional wants are supplied
 in the same manner as those of other people, by treaty, by barter, and
by purchase. With the money which one man gives him he purchases food.
The old cloaths which another bestows upon him he exchanges for other
old cloaths which suit him better, or for lodging, or for food, or for
money, with which he can buy either food, cloaths, or lodging, as he has
 occasion.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt141" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt141_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>17<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_248">As it is by treaty, by barter, and by purchase, that we obtain from<span class="type-margin"><span>It is encouraged by self-interest and leads to division of labour,</span></span>
 one another the greater part of those mutual good offices which we
stand in need of, so it is this same trucking disposition which
originally gives occasion to the division of labour. In a tribe of
hunters or shepherds a particular person makes bows and arrows, for
example, with more readiness and dexterity than any other. He frequently
 exchanges them for cattle or for venison with his companions; and he
finds at last that he can in this manner get more cattle and venison,
than if he himself went to the field to catch them. From a regard to his
 own interest, therefore, the making of bows and arrows grows to be his
chief business, and he becomes a sort of armourer. Another excels in
making the frames and covers of their little huts or moveable houses. He
 is accustomed to be of use in this way to his neighbours, who reward
him in the same manner with cattle and with venison, till at last he
finds it his interest to dedicate himself entirely to this employment,
and to become a sort of house-carpenter. In the same manner a third
becomes a smith or a brazier; a fourth a tanner or dresser of hides or
skins, the principal part of the clothing of savages. And thus the
certainty of being able to exchange all that surplus part of the produce
 of his own labour, which is over and above his own consumption, for
such parts of the produce of other men’s labour as he may have occasion
for, encourages every man to apply himself to a particular occupation,
and to cultivate and bring to perfection whatever talent or genius he
may possess for that particular species of business.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt142" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt142_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_249">The difference of natural talents in different men is, in reality, much<span class="type-margin"><span>thus giving rise to differences of talent more important than the natural differences.</span></span>
 less than we are aware of; and the very different genius which appears
to distinguish men of different professions, when grown up to maturity,
is not upon many occasions so much the cause, as the effect of the
division of labour.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt143" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt143_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 The difference between the most dissimilar characters, between a
philosopher and a common street porter, for example, seems to arise not
so much from nature, as from habit, custom, and education. When they
came into the world, and for the first six or eight years of their
existence, they were, perhaps,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt144" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt144_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 very much alike, and neither their parents nor playfellows could
perceive any remarkable difference. About that age, or soon after, they
come to be employed in very different occupations. The difference of
talents <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>18<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 comes then to be taken notice of, and widens by degrees, till at last
the vanity of the philosopher is willing to acknowledge scarce any
resemblance. But without the disposition to truck, barter, and exchange,
 every man must have procured to himself every necessary and conveniency
 of life which he wanted. All must have had the same duties to perform,
and the same work to do, and there could have been no such difference of
 employment as could alone give occasion to any great difference of
talents.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt145" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt145_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_250"><span class="type-margin"><span>and rendering those differences useful.</span></span>As
 it is this disposition which forms that difference of talents, so
remarkable among men of different professions, so it is this same
disposition which renders that difference useful. Many tribes of animals
 acknowledged to be all of the same species, derive from nature a much
more remarkable distinction of genius, than what, antecedent to custom
and education, appears to take place among men. By nature a philosopher
is not in genius and disposition half so different from a street porter,
 as a mastiff is from a greyhound, or a greyhound from a spaniel, or
this last from a shepherd’s dog. Those different tribes of animals,
however, though all of the same species, are of scarce any use to one
another. The strength of the mastiff is not in the least supported
either by the swiftness of the greyhound, or by the sagacity of the
spaniel, or by the docility of the shepherd’s dog. The effects of those
different geniuses and talents, for want of the power or disposition to
barter and exchange, cannot be brought into a common stock, and do not
in the least contribute to the better accommodation and conveniency of
the species. Each animal is still obliged to support and defend itself,
separately and independently, and derives no sort of advantage from that
 variety of talents with which nature has distinguished its fellows.
Among men, on the contrary, the most dissimilar geniuses are of use to
one another; the different produces of their respective talents, by the
general disposition to truck, barter, and exchange, being brought, as it
 were, into a common stock, where every man may purchase whatever part
of the produce of other men’s talents he has occasion for.</p>

<h2 id="lf0206-01_label_188">CHAPTER III: THAT THE DIVISION OF LABOUR IS LIMITED BY THE EXTENT OF THE MARKET</h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-01_251">AS it is the power of exchanging that gives occasion to the division<span class="type-margin"><span>Division of labour is limited by the extent of the power of exchanging.</span></span>
 of labour, so the extent of this division must always be limited by the
 extent of that power, or, in other words, by the extent of the market.
When the market is very small, no person can have any encouragement to
dedicate himself entirely to one employment, for want of the power to
exchange all that surplus part of the produce of his own labour, which
is over and above his own consumption, for such parts of the produce of
other men’s labour as he has occasion for.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_252">There are some sorts of industry, even of the lowest kind, which can<span class="type-margin"><span>Various trades cannot be carried on except in towns.</span></span>
 be carried on no where but in a great town. A porter, for example, can
find employment and subsistence in no other place. A village is by much
too narrow a sphere for him; even an ordinary market town is scarce
large enough to afford him constant occupation. In the lone houses and
very small villages which are scattered about in so desert a country as
the Highlands of Scotland, every farmer must be butcher, baker and
brewer for his own family. In such situations we can scarce expect to
find even a smith, a carpenter, or a mason, within less than twenty
miles of another of the same trade. The scattered families that live at
eight or ten miles distance from the nearest of them, must learn to
perform themselves a great number of little pieces of work, for which,
in more populous countries, they would call in the assistance of those
workmen. Country workmen are almost every where obliged to apply
themselves to all the different branches of industry that have so much
affinity to one another as to be employed about the same sort of
materials. A country carpenter deals in every sort of work that is made
of wood: a country smith in every sort of work that is made of iron. The
 former is not only a carpenter, but a joiner, a cabinet maker, and even
 a carver in wood, as well as a wheelwright, a ploughwright, a cart and
waggon maker. The employments of the latter are still more various. It
is impossible there should be such a trade as <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>20<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 even that of a nailer in the remote and inland parts of the Highlands
of Scotland. Such a workman at the rate of a thousand nails a day, and
three hundred working days in the year, will make three hundred thousand
 nails in the year. But in such a situation it would be impossible to
dispose of one thousand, that is, of one day’s work in the year.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_253"><span class="type-margin"><span>Water-carriage widens the market,</span></span>As
 by means of water-carriage a more extensive market is opened to every
sort of industry than what land-carriage alone can afford it, so it is
upon the sea-coast, and along the banks of navigable rivers, that
industry of every kind naturally begins to subdivide and improve itself,
 and it is frequently not till a long time after that those improvements
 extend themselves to the inland parts of the country. A broad-wheeled
waggon, attended by two men, and drawn by eight horses, in about six
weeks time carries and brings back between London and Edinburgh near
four ton weight of goods. In about the same time a ship navigated by six
 or eight men, and sailing between the ports of London and Leith,
frequently carries and brings back two hundred ton weight of goods. Six
or eight men, therefore, by the help of water-carriage, can carry and
bring back in the same time the same quantity of goods between London
and Edinburgh, as fifty broad-wheeled waggons, attended by a hundred
men, and drawn by four hundred horses.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt146" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt146_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Upon two hundred tons of goods, therefore, carried by the cheapest
land-carriage from London to Edinburgh, there must be charged the
maintenance of a hundred men for three weeks, and both the maintenance,
and, what is nearly equal to the maintenance, the wear and tear of four
hundred horses as well as of fifty great waggons. Whereas, upon the same
 quantity of goods carried by water, there is to be charged only the
maintenance of six or eight men, and the wear and tear of a ship of two
hundred tons burthen, together with the value of the superior risk, or
the difference of the insurance between land and water-carriage. Were
there no other communication between those two places, therefore, but by
 land-carriage, as no goods could be transported from the one to the
other, except such whose price was very considerable in proportion to
their weight, they could carry on but a small part of that commerce
which at present subsists<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt147" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt147_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 between them, and consequently could give but a small part of that
encouragement which they at present mutually afford to each other’s <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>21<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 industry. There could be little or no commerce of any kind between the
distant parts of the world. What goods could bear the expence of
land-carriage between London and Calcutta?<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt148" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt148_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> Or if there were<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt149" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt149_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 any so precious as to be able to support this expence, with what safety
 could they be transported through the territories of so many barbarous
nations? Those two cities, however, at present carry on a very
considerable commerce with each other,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt150" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt150_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> and by mutually affording a market, give a good deal of encouragement to each other’s industry.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_254">Since such, therefore, are the advantages of water-carriage, it is<span class="type-margin"><span>and so the first improvements are on the sea-coast or navigable rivers,</span></span>
 natural that the first improvements of art and industry should be made
where this conveniency opens the whole world for a market to the produce
 of every sort of labour, and that they should always be much later in
extending themselves into the inland parts of the country. The inland
parts of the country can for a long time have no other market for the
greater part of their goods, but the country which lies round about
them, and separates them from the sea-coast, and the great navigable
rivers. The extent of their market, therefore, must for a long time be
in proportion to the riches and populousness of that country, and
consequently their improvement must always be posterior to the
improvement of that country. In our North American colonies the
plantations have constantly followed either the sea-coast or the banks
of the navigable rivers, and have scarce any where extended themselves
to any considerable distance from both.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_255">The nations that, according to the best authenticated history, appear<span class="type-margin"><span>for example among the ancient nations on the Mediterranean coast.</span></span>
 to have been first civilized, were those that dwelt round the coast of
the Mediterranean sea. That sea, by far the greatest inlet that is known
 in the world, having no tides, nor consequently any waves except such
as are caused by the wind only,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt151" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt151_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 was, by the smoothness of its surface, as well as by the multitude of
its islands, and the proximity of its neighbouring shores, extremely
favourable to the infant navigation of the world; when, from their
ignorance of the compass, men were afraid to quit the view of the coast,
 and from the imperfection of the art of ship-building, to abandon
themselves to the boisterous waves of the ocean. To pass beyond the
pillars of Hercules, that is, to sail out of the Streights of Gibraltar,
 was, in the antient world, long considered as a most wonderful and
dangerous exploit of navigation. It was late before even the Phenicians
and Carthaginians, the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>22<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 most skilful navigators and ship-builders of those old times, attempted
 it, and they were for a long time the only nations that did attempt it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_256"><span class="type-margin"><span>Improvements first took place in Egypt,</span></span>Of
 all the countries on the coast of the Mediterranean sea, Egypt seems to
 have been the first in which either agriculture or manufactures were
cultivated and improved to any considerable degree. Upper Egypt extends
itself nowhere above a few miles from the Nile, and in Lower Egypt that
great river breaks itself into many different canals,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt152" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt152_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 which, with the assistance of a little art, seem to have afforded a
communication by water-carriage, not only between all the great towns,
but between all the considerable villages, and even to many farm-houses
in the country; nearly in the same manner as the Rhine and the Maese do
in Holland at present. The extent and easiness of this inland navigation
 was probably one of the principal causes of the early improvement of
Egypt.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_257"><span class="type-margin"><span>Bengal and China;</span></span>The
 improvements in agriculture and manufactures seem likewise to have been
 of very great antiquity in the provinces of Bengal in the East Indies,
and in some of the eastern provinces of China; though the great extent
of this antiquity is not authenticated by any histories of whose
authority we, in this part of the world, are well assured. In Bengal the
 Ganges and several other great rivers form a great number of navigable
canals<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt153" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt153_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 in the same manner as the Nile does in Egypt. In the Eastern provinces
of China too, several great rivers form, by their different branches, a
multitude of canals, and by communicating with one another afford an
inland navigation much more extensive than that either of the Nile or
the Ganges, or perhaps than both of them put together. It is remarkable
that neither the antient Egyptians, nor the Indians, nor the Chinese,
encouraged foreign commerce, but seem all to have derived their great
opulence from this inland navigation.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_258"><span class="type-margin"><span>while Africa, Tartary and Siberia, and also Bavaria, Austria and Hungary are backward.</span></span>All
 the inland parts of Africa, and all that part of Asia which lies any
considerable way north of the Euxine and Caspian seas, the antient
Scythia, the modern Tartary and Siberia, seem in all ages of the world
to have been in the same barbarous and uncivilized state in which we
find them at present. The sea of Tartary is the frozen ocean which
admits of no navigation, and though some of the greatest rivers in the
world run through that country,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt154" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt154_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> they are at too great a distance from one another to carry commerce and communication through the greater <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>23<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 part of it. There are in Africa none of those great inlets, such as the
 Baltic and Adriatic seas in Europe, the Mediterranean and Euxine seas
in both Europe and Asia, and the gulphs of Arabia, Persia, India,
Bengal, and Siam, in Asia, to carry maritime commerce into the interior
parts of that great continent: and the great rivers of Africa are at too
 great a distance from one another to give occasion to any considerable
inland navigation. The commerce besides which any nation can carry on by
 means of a river which does not break itself into any great number of
branches or canals, and which runs into another territory before it
reaches the sea, can never be very considerable; because it is always in
 the power of the nations who possess that other territory to obstruct
the communication between the upper country and the sea. The navigation
of the Danube is of very little use to the different states of Bavaria,
Austria and Hungary, in comparison of what it would be if any<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt155" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt155_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> of them possessed the whole of its course till it falls into the Black Sea.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt156" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt156_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>

<h2 id="lf0206-01_label_200">CHAPTER IV: OF THE ORIGIN AND USE OF MONEY</h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-01_259"><span class="type-margin"><span>Division of labour being established, every man lives by exchanging.</span></span>WHEN
 the division of labour has been once thoroughly established, it is but a
 very small part of a man’s wants which the produce of his own labour
can supply. He supplies the far greater part of them by exchanging that
surplus part of the produce of his own labour, which is over and above
his own consumption, for such parts of the produce of other men’s labour
 as he has occasion for. Every man thus lives by exchanging, or becomes
in some measure a merchant, and the society itself grows to be what is
properly a commercial society.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_260"><span class="type-margin"><span>Difficulties of barterlead to the selection of one commodity as money,</span></span>But
 when the division of labour first began to take place, this power of
exchanging must frequently have been very much clogged and embarrassed
in its operations. One man, we shall suppose, has more of a certain
commodity than he himself has occasion for, while another has less. The
former consequently would be glad to dispose of, and the latter to
purchase, a part of this superfluity. But if this latter should chance
to have nothing that the former stands in need of, no exchange can be
made between them. The butcher has more meat in his shop than he himself
 can consume, and the brewer and the baker would each of them be willing
 to purchase a part of it. But they have nothing to offer in exchange,
except the different productions of their respective trades, and the
butcher is already provided with all the bread and beer which he has
immediate occasion for. No exchange can, in this case, be made between
them. He cannot be their merchant, nor they his customers; and they are
all of them thus mutually less serviceable to one another. In order to
avoid the inconveniency of such situations, every prudent man in every
period of society, after the first establishment of the division of
labour, must naturally have endeavoured to manage his affairs in such a
manner, as to have at all times by him, besides the peculiar produce of
his own industry, a certain quantity of some one commodity or <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>25<span class="bracket">]</span></span> other, such as he imagined few people would be likely to refuse in exchange for the produce of their industry.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt157" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt157_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_261">Many different commodities, it is probable, were successively both<span class="type-margin"><span>for example, cattle, salt, shells, cod, tobacco, sugar, leather and nails.</span></span>
 thought of and employed for this purpose. In the rude ages of society,
cattle are said to have been the common instrument of commerce; and,
though they must have been a most inconvenient one, yet in old times we
find things were frequently valued according to the number of cattle
which had been given in exchange for them. The armour of Diomede, says
Homer, cost only nine oxen; but that of Glaucus cost an hundred oxen.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt158" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt158_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> Salt is said to be the common instrument of commerce and exchanges in Abyssinia;<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt159" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt159_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> a species of shells in some parts of the coast of India; dried cod at Newfoundland; tobacco in Virginia;<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt160" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt160_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 sugar in some of our West India colonies; hides or dressed leather in
some other countries; and there is at this day a village in Scotland
where it is not uncommon, I am told, for a workman to carry nails
instead of money to the baker’s shop or the ale-house.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt161" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt161_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_262">In all countries, however, men seem at last to have been determined<span class="type-margin"><span>Metals were eventually preferred because durable and divisible.</span></span> by irresistible reasons to give the preference, for this employment, to metals above every other commodity.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt162" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt162_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">6</a>
 Metals can not only be kept with as little loss as any other commodity,
 scarce any thing being less perishable than they are, but they can
likewise, without any loss, be divided into any number of parts, as by
fusion those parts can easily be reunited again; a quality which no
other equally durable commodities possess, and which more than any other
 quality renders them fit to be the instruments of commerce and
circulation. The man who wanted to buy salt, for example, and had
nothing but cattle to give in exchange for it, must have been obliged to
 buy salt to the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>26<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 value of a whole ox, or a whole sheep, at a time. He could seldom buy
less than this, because what he was to give for it could seldom be
divided without loss; and if he had a mind to buy more, he must, for the
 same reasons, have been obliged to buy double or triple the quantity,
the value, to wit, of two or three oxen, or of two or three sheep. If,
on the contrary, instead of sheep or oxen, he had metals to give in
exchange for it, he could easily proportion the quantity of the metal to
 the precise quantity of the commodity which he had immediate occasion
for.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_263"><span class="type-margin"><span>Iron, copper, gold and silver,</span></span>Different
 metals have been made use of by different nations for this purpose.
Iron was the common instrument of commerce among the antient Spartans;
copper among the antient Romans; and gold and silver among all rich and
commercial nations.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_264"><span class="type-margin"><span>were at first used in unstamped bars,</span></span>Those
 metals seem originally to have been made use of for this purpose in
rude bars, without any stamp or coinage. Thus we are told by Pliny,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt163" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt163_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 upon the authority of Timæus, an antient historian, that, till the time
 of Servius Tullius, the Romans had no coined money, but made use of
unstamped bars of copper, to purchase whatever they had occasion for.
These rude bars, therefore, performed at this time the function of
money.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_265"><span class="type-margin"><span>and after wards stamped to show quantity and fineness;</span></span>The
 use of metals in this rude state was attended with two very
considerable inconveniencies; first with the trouble of weighing;<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt164" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt164_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> and, secondly, with that<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt165" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt165_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 of assaying them. In the precious metals, where a small difference in
the quantity makes a great difference in the value, even the business of
 weighing, with proper exactness, requires at least very accurate
weights and scales. The weighing of gold in particular is an operation
of some nicety. In the coarser metals, indeed, where a small error would
 be of little consequence, less accuracy would, no doubt, be necessary.
Yet we should find it excessively troublesome, if every time a poor man
had occasion either to buy or sell a farthing’s worth of goods, he was
obliged to weigh the farthing. The operation of assaying is still more
difficult, still more tedious, and, unless a part of the metal is fairly
 melted in the crucible, with proper dissolvents, any conclusion that
can be drawn from it, is extremely uncertain. Before the institution of
coined money, however, unless they went through this tedious and
difficult operation, people must always have been liable to the grossest
 frauds <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>27<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 and impositions, and instead of a pound weight of pure silver, or pure
copper, might receive in exchange for their goods, an adulterated
composition of the coarsest and cheapest materials, which had, however,
in their outward appearance, been made to resemble those metals. To
prevent such abuses, to facilitate exchanges, and thereby to encourage
all sorts of industry and commerce, it has been found necessary, in all
countries that have made any considerable advances towards improvement,
to affix a public stamp upon certain quantities of such particular
metals, as were in those countries commonly made use of to purchase
goods. Hence the origin of coined money, and of those public offices
called mints;<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt166" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt166_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> institutions exactly of the same nature with those of the aulnagers and stampmasters of woollen and linen cloth.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt167" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt167_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 All of them are equally meant to ascertain, by means of a public stamp,
 the quantity and uniform goodness of those different commodities when
brought to market.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_266">The first public stamps of this kind that were affixed to the current<span class="type-margin"><span>stamps to show fineness being introduced first,</span></span>
 metals, seem in many cases to have been intended to ascertain, what it
was both most difficult and most important to ascertain, the goodness or
 fineness of the metal, and to have resembled the sterling mark which is
 at present affixed to plate and bars of silver, or the Spanish mark
which is sometimes affixed to ingots of gold, and which being struck
only upon one side of the piece, and not covering the whole surface,
ascertains the fineness, but not the weight of the metal. Abraham weighs
 to Ephorn the four hundred shekels of silver which he had agreed to pay
 for the field of Machpelah.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt168" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt168_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 They are said however to be the current money of the merchant, and yet
are received by weight and not by tale, in the same manner as ingots of
gold and bars of silver are at present. The revenues of the antient
Saxon kings of England are said to have been paid, not in money but in
kind, that is, in victuals and provisions of all sorts. William the
Conqueror introduced the custom of paying them in money.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt169" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt169_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> This <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>28<span class="bracket">]</span></span> money, however, was, for a long time, received at the exchequer, by weight and not by tale.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt170" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt170_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_267"><span class="type-margin"><span>and coinage to show weight later.</span></span>The
 inconveniency and difficulty of weighing those metals with exactness
gave occasion to the institution of coins, of which the stamp, covering
entirely both sides of the piece and sometimes the edges too, was
supposed to ascertain not only the fineness, but the weight of the
metal. Such coins, therefore, were received by tale as at present,
without the trouble of weighing.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_268"><span class="type-margin"><span>The names of coins originally expressed their weight.</span></span>The
 denominations of those coins seem originally to have expressed the
weight or quantity of metal contained in them. In the time of Servius
Tullius, who first coined money at Rome,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt171" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt171_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 the Roman As or Pondo contained a Roman pound of good copper. It was
divided in the same manner as our Troyes pound, into twelve ounces, each
 of which contained a real ounce of good copper. The English pound
sterling in the time of Edward I., contained a pound, Tower weight, of
silver of a known fineness. The Tower pound seems to have been something
 more than the Roman pound, and something less than the Troyes pound.
This last was not introduced into the mint of England till the 18th of
Henry VIII. The French livre contained in the time of Charlemagne a
pound, Troyes weight, of silver of a known fineness. The fair of Troyes
in Champaign was at that time frequented by all the nations of Europe,
and the weights and measures of so famous a market were generally known
and esteemed. The Scots money pound contained, from the time of
Alexander the First to that of Robert Bruce, a pound of silver of the
same weight and fineness with the English pound sterling. English,
French, and Scots pennies too, contained all of them originally a real
pennyweight of silver, the twentieth part of an ounce, and the
two-hundred-and-fortieth part of a pound. The shilling too seems
originally to have been the denomination of a weight. <span class="ital">When wheat is at twelve shillings the quarter,</span> says an antient statute of Henry III. <span class="ital">then wastel bread of a farthing shall weigh eleven shillings and four pence.</span><a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt172" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt172_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 The proportion, however, between the shilling and either the penny on
the one hand, or the pound on the other, seems not to have been so
constant and uniform as that between the penny and the pound. During the
 first race of the kings of France, the French sou or shilling appears
upon different occasions <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>29<span class="bracket">]</span></span> to have contained five, twelve, twenty, and forty pennies.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt173" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt173_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> Among the antient Saxons a shilling appears at one time to have contained only five pennies,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt174" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt174_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 and it is not improbable that it may have been as variable among them
as among their neighbours, the antient Franks. From the time of
Charlemagne among the French,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt175" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt175_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> and from that of William the Conqueror among the English,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt176" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt176_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 the proportion between the pound, the shilling, and the penny, seems to
 have been uniformly the same as at present, though the value of each
has been very different. For in every country of the world, I believe,
the avarice and injustice of princes and sovereign states, abusing the
confidence of their subjects, have by degrees diminished the real
quantity of metal, which had been originally contained in their coins.
The Roman As, in the latter ages of the Republic, was reduced to the
twenty-fourth part of its original value, and, instead of weighing a
pound, came to weigh only half an ounce.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt177" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt177_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a>
 The English pound and penny contain at present about a third only; the
Scots pound and penny about a thirty-sixth; and the French pound and
penny about a sixty-sixth part of their original value.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt178" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt178_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">6</a>
 By means of those operations the princes and sovereign states which
performed them were enabled, in appearance, to pay their debts and to
fulfil their engagements with a smaller quantity of silver than would
otherwise have been requisite. It was indeed in appearance only; for
their creditors were really defrauded of a part of what was due to them.
 All other debtors in the state were allowed the same privilege, and
might pay with the same nominal sum of the new and debased coin whatever
 they had borrowed in the old. Such operations, therefore, have always
proved favourable to the debtor, and ruinous to the creditor, and have
sometimes produced a greater and more universal revolution in the
fortunes of private persons, than could have been occasioned by a very
great public calamity.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt179" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt179_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">7</a></p>

 the universal instrument of commerce, by the intervention of which

<p id="Smith_0206-01_270"><span class="type-margin"><span>The next inquiry is what rules determine exchangeable value.</span></span>What
 are the rules which men naturally observe in exchanging them either for
 money or for one another, I shall now proceed to examine. These rules
determine what may be called the relative or exchangeable value of
goods.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_271">The word <span class="sc">value,</span> it is
to be observed, has two different meanings, and sometimes expresses the
utility of some particular object, and sometimes the power of purchasing
 other goods which the possession of that object conveys.<span class="type-margin"><span>Value may mean either value in use or value in exchange.</span></span>
 The one may be called “value in use;” the other, “value in exchange.”
The things which have the greatest value in use have frequently little
or no value in exchange; and on the contrary, those which have the
greatest value in exchange have frequently little or no value in use.
Nothing is more useful than water: but it will purchase scarce any
thing; scarce any thing can be had in exchange for it. A diamond, on the
 contrary, has scarce any value in use; but a very great quantity of
other goods may frequently be had in exchange for it.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt181" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt181_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_272"><span class="type-margin"><span>Three questions,</span></span>In order to investigate the principles which regulate the exchangeable value of commodities, I shall endeavour to shew,<span class="type-margin"><span>(1)

<h2 id="lf0206-01_label_227">CHAPTER V: OF THE REAL AND NOMINAL PRICE OF COMMODITIES, OR OF THEIR PRICE IN LABOUR, AND THEIR PRICE IN MONEY</h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-01_277"><span class="type-margin"><span>Labour is the real measure of exchangeable value,</span></span>EVERY
 man is rich or poor according to the degree in which he can afford to
enjoy the necessaries, conveniencies, and amusements of human life.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt183" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt183_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 But after the division of labour has once thoroughly taken place, it is
 but a very small part of these with which a man’s own labour can supply
 him. The far greater part of them he must derive from the labour of
other people, and he must be rich or poor according to the quantity of
that labour which he can command, or which he can afford to purchase.
The value of any commodity, therefore, to the person who possesses it,
and who means not to use or consume it himself, but to exchange it for
other commodities, is equal to the quantity of labour which it enables
him to purchase or command. Labour, therefore, is the real measure of
the exchangeable value of all commodities.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_278"><span class="type-margin"><span>and the first price paid for all things.</span></span>The
 real price of every thing, what every thing really costs to the man who
 wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of acquiring it. What
every thing is really worth to the man who has acquired it, and who
wants to dispose of it or exchange it for something else, is the toil
and trouble which it can save to himself, and which it can impose upon
other people. What is bought with money or with goods is purchased by
labour,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt184" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt184_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 as much as what we acquire by the toil of our own body. That money or
those goods indeed save us this toil. They contain the value of a
certain quantity of labour which we exchange for what is supposed at the
 time to contain the value of an equal quantity. Labour was the first
price, the original purchase-money that was paid for all things. It was
not by gold or by silver, but by <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>33<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 labour, that all the wealth of the world was originally purchased; and
its value, to those who possess it, and who want to exchange it for some
 new productions, is precisely equal to the quantity of labour which it
can enable them to purchase or command.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_279">Wealth, as Mr. Hobbes says, is power.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt185" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt185_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> But the person who either<span class="type-margin"><span>Wealth is power of purchasing labour.</span></span>
 acquires, or succeeds to a great fortune, does not necessarily acquire
or succeed to any political power, either civil or military. His fortune
 may, perhaps, afford him the means of acquiring both, but the mere
possession of that fortune does not necessarily convey to him either.
The power which that possession immediately and directly conveys to him,
 is the power of purchasing; a certain command over all the labour, or
over all the produce of labour which is then in the market. His fortune
is greater or less, precisely in proportion to the extent of this power;
 or to the quantity either of other men’s labour, or, what is the same
thing, of the produce of other men’s labour, which it enables him to
purchase or command. The exchangeable value of every thing must always
be precisely equal to the extent of this power which it conveys to its
owner.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt186" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt186_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_280">But though labour be the real measure of the exchangeable value<span class="type-margin"><span>But value is not commonly estimated by labour, because labour is difficult to measure.</span></span>
 of all commodities, it is not that by which their value is commonly
estimated. It is often difficult to ascertain the proportion between two
 different quantities of labour. The time spent in two different sorts
of work will not always alone determine this proportion. The different
degrees of hardship endured, and of ingenuity exercised, must likewise
be taken into account. There may be more labour in an hour’s hard work
than in two hours easy business; or in an hour’s application to a trade
which it cost ten years labour to learn, than in a month’s industry at
an ordinary and obvious employment. But it is not easy to find any
accurate measure either of hardship or ingenuity. In exchanging indeed
the different productions of different sorts of labour for one another,
some allowance is commonly made for both. It is adjusted, however, not
by any accurate measure, but by the higgling and bargaining of the
market, according to that sort of rough equality which, though not
exact, is sufficient for carrying on the business of common life.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt187" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt187_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_281">Every commodity besides, is more frequently exchanged for, and<span class="type-margin"><span>and commodities are more frequently exchanged for other commodities,</span></span> <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>34<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 thereby compared with, other commodities than with labour. It is more
natural therefore, to estimate its exchangeable value by the quantity of
 some other commodity than by that of the labour which it can purchase.
The greater part of people too understand better what is meant by a
quantity of a particular commodity, than by a quantity of labour. The
one is a plain palpable object; the other an abstract notion, which,
though it can be made sufficiently intelligible, is not altogether so
natural and obvious.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_282"><span class="type-margin"><span>especially money, which is therefore more frequently used in estimating value.</span></span>But
 when barter ceases, and money has become the common instrument of
commerce, every particular commodity is more frequently exchanged for
money than for any other commodity. The butcher seldom carries his beef
or his mutton to the baker, or the brewer, in order to exchange them for
 bread or for beer; but he carries them to the market, where he
exchanges them for money, and afterwards exchanges that money for bread
and for beer. The quantity of money which he gets for them regulates too
 the quantity of bread and beer which he can afterwards purchase. It is
more natural and obvious to him, therefore, to estimate their value by
the quantity of money, the commodity for which he immediately exchanges
them, than by that of bread and beer, the commodities for which he can
exchange them only by the intervention of another commodity; and rather
to say that his butcher’s meat is worth threepence or fourpence a pound,
 than that it is worth three or four pounds of bread, or three or four
quarts of small beer. Hence it comes to pass, that the exchangeable
value of every commodity is more frequently estimated by the quantity of
 money, than by the quantity either of labour or of any other commodity
which can be had in exchange for it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_283"><span class="type-margin"><span>But gold and
silver vary in value, sometimes costing more and sometimes less labour,
whereas equal labour always means equal sacrifice to the labourer,</span></span>Gold
 and silver, however, like every other commodity, vary in their value,
are sometimes cheaper and sometimes dearer, sometimes of easier and
sometimes of more difficult purchase. The quantity of labour which any
particular quantity of them can purchase or command, or the quantity of
other goods which it will exchange for, depends always upon the
fertility or barrenness of the mines which happen to be known about the
time when such exchanges are made. The discovery of the abundant mines
of America reduced, in the sixteenth century, the value of gold and
silver in Europe to about a third of what it had been before.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt188" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt188_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> As it cost less labour to bring those metals from the mine to the market, so when they were brought thither<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt189" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt189_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 they could purchase or command less labour; and this revolution in
their value, though perhaps the greatest, is by no means the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>35<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 only one of which history gives some account. But as a measure of
quantity, such as the natural foot, fathom, or handful, which is
continually varying in its own quantity, can never be an accurate
measure of the quantity of other things; so a commodity which is itself
continually varying in its own value, can never be an accurate measure
of the value of other commodities. Equal quantities of labour, at all
times and places, may be said to be<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt190" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt190_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 of equal value to the labourer. In his ordinary state of health,
strength and spirits; in the ordinary degree of his skill and dexterity,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt191" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt191_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 he must always lay down the same portion of his ease, his liberty, and
his happiness. The price which he pays must always be the same, whatever
 may be the quantity of goods which he receives in return for it. Of
these, indeed, it may sometimes purchase a greater and sometimes a
smaller quantity; but it is their value which varies, not that of the
labour which purchases them. At all times and places that is dear which
it is difficult to come at, or which it costs much labour to acquire;
and that cheap which is to be had easily, or with very little labour.
Labour alone, therefore, never varying in its own value, is alone the
ultimate and real standard by which the value of all commodities can at
all times and places be estimated and compared. It is their real price;
money is their nominal price only.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_284">But though equal quantities of labour are always of equal value to<span class="type-margin"><span>although the employer regards labour as varying in value.</span></span>
 the labourer, yet to the person who employs him they appear sometimes
to be of greater and sometimes of smaller value. He purchases them
sometimes with a greater and sometimes with a smaller quantity of goods,
 and to him the price of labour seems to vary like that of all other
things. It appears to him dear in the one case, and cheap in the other.
In reality, however, it is the goods which are cheap in the one case,
and dear in the other.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_285">In this popular sense, therefore, labour, like commodities, may be<span class="type-margin"><span>So regarded, labour has a real and a nominal price.</span></span>
 said to have a real and a nominal price. Its real price may be said to
consist in the quantity of the necessaries and conveniencies of life
which are given for it; its nominal price, in the quantity of money. The
 labourer is rich or poor, is well or ill rewarded, in proportion to the
 real, not to the nominal price of his labour.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_286">The distinction between the real and the nominal price of commodities<span class="type-margin"><span>The distinction between real and nominal is sometimes useful in practice,</span></span>
 and labour, is not a matter of mere speculation, but may sometimes be
of considerable use in practice. The same real price is always of the
same value; but on account of the variations in the value of gold <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>36<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 and silver, the same nominal price is sometimes of very different
values. When a landed estate, therefore, is sold with a reservation of a
 perpetual rent, if it is intended that this rent should always be of
the same value, it is of importance to the family in whose favour it is
reserved, that it should not consist in a particular sum of money.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt192" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt192_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Its value would in this case be liable to variations of two different
kinds; first, to those which arise from the different quantities of gold
 and silver which are contained at different times in coin of the same
denomination; and, secondly, to those which arise from the different
values of equal quantities of gold and silver at different times.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_287"><span class="type-margin"><span>since the amount of metal in coins tends to diminish,</span></span>Princes
 and sovereign states have frequently fancied that they had a temporary
interest to diminish the quantity of pure metal contained in their
coins; but they seldom have fancied that they had any to augment it. The
 quantity of metal contained in the coins, I believe of all nations,
has, accordingly, been almost continually diminishing, and hardly ever
augmenting.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt193" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt193_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> Such variations therefore tend almost always to diminish the value of a money rent.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_288"><span class="type-margin"><span>and the value of gold and silver to fall.</span></span>The
 discovery of the mines of America diminished the value of gold and
silver in Europe. This diminution, it is commonly supposed, though I
apprehend without any certain proof, is still going on gradually,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt194" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt194_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 and is likely to continue to do so for a long time. Upon this
supposition, therefore, such variations are more likely to diminish,
than to augment the value of a money rent, even though it should be
stipulated to be paid, not in such a quantity of coined money of such a
denomination (in so many pounds sterling, for example), but in so many
ounces either of pure silver, or of silver of a certain standard.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_289"><span class="type-margin"><span>English rents reserved in money have fallen to a fourth since 1586,</span></span>The
 rents which have been reserved in corn have preserved their value much
better than those which have been reserved in money, even where the
denomination of the coin has not been altered. By the 18th of Elizabeth<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt195" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt195_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> it was enacted, That a third of the rent of all college <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>37<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 leases should be reserved in corn, to be paid, either in kind, or
according to the current prices at the nearest public market. The money
arising from this corn rent, though originally but a third of the whole,
 is in the present times, according to Doctor Blackstone, commonly near
double of what arises from the other two-thirds.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt196" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt196_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The old money rents of colleges must, according to this account, have
sunk almost to a fourth part of their ancient value; or are worth little
 more than a fourth part of the corn which they were formerly worth. But
 since the reign of Philip and Mary the denomination of the English coin
 has undergone little or no alteration, and the same number of pounds,
shillings and pence have contained very nearly the same quantity of pure
 silver. This degradation, therefore, in the value of the money rents of
 colleges, has arisen altogether from the degradation in the value of
silver.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_290">When the degradation in the value of silver is combined with the<span class="type-margin"><span>and similar Scotch and French rents almost to nothing.</span></span>
 diminution of the quantity of it contained in the coin of the same
denomination, the loss is frequently still greater. In Scotland, where
the denomination of the coin has undergone much greater alterations than
 it ever did in England, and in France, where it has undergone still
greater than it ever did in Scotland,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt197" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt197_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> some ancient rents, originally of considerable value, have in this manner been reduced almost to nothing.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_291">Equal quantities of labour will at distant times be purchased more<span class="type-margin"><span>Corn rents are more stable than money rents,</span></span>
 nearly with equal quantities of corn, the subsistence of the labourer,
than with equal quantities of gold and silver, or perhaps of any other
commodity. Equal quantities of corn, therefore, will, at distant times,
be more nearly of the same real value, or enable the possessor to
purchase or command more nearly the same quantity of the labour of other
 people. They will do this, I say, more nearly than equal quantities of
almost any other commodity; for even equal quantities of corn will not
do it exactly. The subsistence of the labourer, or the real price of
labour, as I shall endeavour to show hereafter,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt198" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt198_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 is very different upon different occasions; more liberal in a society
advancing to opulence, than in one that is standing still; and in one
that is standing still, than in one that is going backwards. Every other
 commodity, however, will at any particular time purchase a greater or
smaller quantity of labour in proportion to the quantity of subsistence
which it can purchase at that time. A rent therefore reserved in corn is
 liable only to the variations in the quantity of labour which a certain
 quantity of corn can purchase. But a rent reserved in any other
commodity is liable, not <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>38<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 only to the variations in the quantity of labour which any particular
quantity of corn can purchase, but to the variations in the quantity of
corn which can be purchased by any particular quantity of that
commodity.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_292"><span class="type-margin"><span>but liable to much larger annual variations,</span></span>Though
 the real value of a corn rent, it is to be observed however, varies
much less from century to century than that of a money rent, it varies
much more from year to year. The money price of labour, as I shall
endeavour to show hereafter,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt199" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt199_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 does not fluctuate from year to year with the money price of corn, but
seems to be every where accommodated, not to the temporary or
occasional, but to the average or ordinary price of that necessary of
life. The average or ordinary price of corn again is regulated, as I
shall likewise endeavour to show hereafter,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt200" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt200_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 by the value of silver, by the richness or barrenness of the mines
which supply the market with that metal, or by the quantity of labour
which must be employed, and consequently of corn which must be consumed,
 in order to bring any particular quantity of silver<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt201" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt201_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 from the mine to the market. But the value of silver, though it
sometimes varies greatly from century to century, seldom varies much
from year to year, but frequently continues the same, or very nearly the
 same, for half a century or a century together. The ordinary or average
 money price of corn, therefore, may, during so long a period, continue
the same or very nearly the same too, and along with it the money price
of labour, provided, at least, the society continues, in other respects,
 in the same or nearly in the same condition. In the mean time the
temporary and occasional price of corn may frequently be double, one
year, of what it had been the year before, or fluctuate, for example,
from five and twenty to fifty shillings the quarter.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt202" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt202_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 But when corn is at the latter price, not only the nominal, but the
real value of a corn rent will be double of what it is when at the
former, or will command double the quantity either of labour or of the
greater part of other commodities; the money price of labour, and along
with it that of most other things, continuing the same during all these
fluctuations.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_293"><span class="type-margin"><span>so that labour is the only universal standard.</span></span>Labour,
 therefore, it appears evidently, is the only universal, as well as the
only accurate measure of value, or the only standard by which we can
compare the values of different commodities at all times and at all
places. We cannot estimate, it is allowed, the real value of different
commodities from century to century by the quantities of silver which
were given for them. We cannot estimate it from year to year by the
quantities of corn. By the quantities of labour we can, with <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>39<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 the greatest accuracy, estimate it both from century to century and
from year to year. From century to century, corn is a better measure
than silver, because, from century to century, equal quantities of corn
will command the same quantity of labour more nearly than equal
quantities of silver. From year to year, on the contrary, silver is a
better measure than corn, because equal quantities of it will more
nearly command the same quantity of labour.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt203" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt203_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_294">But though in establishing perpetual rents, or even in letting very<span class="type-margin"><span>But in ordinary transactions money is sufficient,</span></span>
 long leases, it may be of use to distinguish between real and nominal
price; it is of none in buying and selling, the more common and ordinary
 transactions of human life.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_295">At the same time and place the real and the nominal price of all<span class="type-margin"><span>being perfectly accurate at the same time and place,</span></span>
 commodities are exactly in proportion to one another. The more or less
money you get for any commodity, in the London market, for example, the
more or less labour it will at that time and place enable you to
purchase or command. At the same time and place, therefore, money is the
 exact measure of the real exchangeable value of all commodities. It is
so, however, at the same time and place only.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_296">Though at distant places, there is no regular proportion between<span class="type-margin"><span>and the only thing to be considered in transactions between distant places.</span></span>
 the real and the money price of commodities, yet the merchant who
carries goods from the one to the other has nothing to consider but
their money price, or the difference between the quantity of silver for
which he buys them, and that for which he is likely to sell them. Half
an ounce of silver at Canton in China may command a greater quantity
both of labour and of the necessaries and conveniencies of life, than an
 ounce at London. A commodity, therefore, which sells for half an ounce
of silver at Canton may there be really dearer, of more real importance
to the man who possesses it there, than a commodity which sells for an
ounce at London is to<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt204" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt204_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> the man who possesses it at <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>40<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 London. If a London merchant, however, can buy at Canton for half an
ounce of silver, a commodity which he can afterwards sell at London for
an ounce, he gains a hundred per cent. by the bargain, just as much as
if an ounce of silver was at London exactly of the same value as at
Canton. It is of no importance to him that half an ounce of silver at
Canton would have given him the command of more labour and of a greater
quantity of the necessaries and conveniencies of life than an ounce can
do at London. An ounce at London will always give him the command of
double the quantity of all these, which half an ounce could have done
there, and this is precisely what he wants.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_297"><span class="type-margin"><span>So it is no wonder that money price has been more attended to.</span></span>As
 it is the nominal or money price of goods, therefore, which finally
determines the prudence or imprudence of all purchases and sales, and
thereby regulates almost the whole business of common life in which
price is concerned, we cannot wonder that it should have been so much
more attended to than the real price.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_298"><span class="type-margin"><span>In this work corn prices will sometimes be used.</span></span>In
 such a work as this, however, it may sometimes be of use to compare the
 different real values of a particular commodity at different times and
places, or the different degrees of power over the labour of other
people which it may, upon different occasions, have given to those who
possessed it. We must in this case compare, not so much the different
quantities of silver for which it was commonly sold, as the different
quantities of labour which those different quantities of silver could
have purchased. But the current prices of labour at distant times and
places can scarce ever be known with any degree of exactness. Those of
corn, though they have in few places been regularly recorded, are in
general better known and have been more frequently taken notice of by
historians and other writers. We must generally, therefore, content
ourselves with them, not as being always exactly in the same proportion
as the current prices of labour, but as being the nearest approximation
which can commonly be had to that proportion. I shall hereafter have
occasion to make several comparisons of this kind.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt205" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt205_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_299"><span class="type-margin"><span>Several metals have been coined, but only one is used as the standard, and that usually the one first used in commerce,</span></span>In
 the progress of industry, commercial nations have found it convenient
to coin several different metals into money; gold for larger payments,
silver for purchases of moderate value, and copper, or some other coarse
 metal, for those of still smaller consideration. They have always,
however, considered one of those metals as more peculiarly the measure
of value than any of the other two; and this preference seems generally
to have been given to the metal which they happened first to make use of
 as the instrument of commerce. Having once begun <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>41<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 to use it as their standard, which they must have done when they had no
 other money, they have generally continued to do so even when the
necessity was not the same.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_300">The Romans are said to have had nothing but copper money till<span class="type-margin"><span>as the Romans used copper,</span></span> within five years before the first Punic war,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt206" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt206_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 when they first began to coin silver. Copper, therefore, appears to
have continued always the measure of value in that republic. At Rome all
 accounts appear to have been kept, and the value of all estates to have
 been computed, either in <span class="ital">Asses</span> or in <span class="ital">Sestertii.</span> The <span class="ital">As</span> was always the denomination of a copper coin.

 a silver coin, its value was estimated in copper. At Rome, one who owed
 a great deal of money, was said to have a great deal of other people’s
copper.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt208" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt208_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_301">The northern nations who established themselves upon the ruins of<span class="type-margin"><span>and modern European nations silver.</span></span>
 the Roman empire, seem to have had silver money from the first
beginning of their settlements, and not to have known either gold or
copper coins for several ages thereafter. There were silver coins in
England in the time of the Saxons; but there was little gold coined till
 the time of Edward III. nor any copper till that of James I. of Great
Britain. In England, therefore, and for the same reason, I believe, in
all other modern nations of Europe, all accounts are kept, and the value
 of all goods and of all estates is generally computed in silver: and
when we mean to express the amount of a person’s fortune, we seldom
mention the number of guineas, but the number of pounds sterling<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt209" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt209_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> which we suppose would be given for it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_302">Originally, in all countries, I believe, a legal tender of payment<span class="type-margin"><span>The standard metal originally was the only legal tender,</span></span> could<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt210" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt210_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a> be made only in the coin of that metal,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt211" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt211_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">6</a>
 which was peculiarly considered as the standard or measure of value. In
 England, gold was not considered as a legal tender for a long time
after it was coined into money. The proportion between the values of
gold and silver money was not fixed by any public law or proclamation;
but was left to be settled by the market. If a debtor offered payment in
 gold, the creditor might either reject such payment altogether, or
accept of it at such a valuation of the gold as he and his debtor could
agree upon. Copper is not at present a legal tender, except in the
change of the smaller silver coins. In this state of things the
distinction between the metal which was the standard, and that which was
 not the standard, was something more than a nominal distinction.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>42<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_303"><span class="type-margin"><span>later the
proportion between the values of the two metals is declared by law, and
both are legal tender, the distinction between them ceasing to be of
importance,</span></span>In process of time, and as people became
gradually more familiar with the use of the different metals in coin,
and consequently better acquainted with the proportion between their
respective values, it has in most countries, I believe, been found
convenient to ascertain this proportion, and to declare by a public law<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt212" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt212_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 that a guinea, for example, of such a weight and fineness, should
exchange for one-and-twenty shillings, or be a legal tender for a debt
of that amount.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt213" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt213_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 In this state of things, and during the continuance of any one
regulated proportion of this kind, the distinction between the metal
which is the standard, and that which is not the standard, becomes
little more than a nominal distinction.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt214" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt214_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_304"><span class="type-margin"><span>except when a change is made in the regulated proportion.</span></span>In
 consequence of any change, however, in this regulated proportion, this
distinction becomes, or at least seems to become, something more than
nominal again. If the regulated value of a guinea, for example, was
either reduced to twenty, or raised to two-and-twenty shillings, all
accounts being kept and almost all obligations for debt being expressed
in silver money, the greater part of payments could in either case be
made with the same quantity of silver money as before; but would require
 very different quantities of gold money; a greater in the one case, and
 a smaller in the other. Silver would appear to be more invariable in
its value than gold. Silver would appear to measure the value of gold,
and gold would not appear to measure the value of silver. The value of
gold would seem to depend upon the quantity of silver which it would
exchange for; and the value of silver would not seem to depend upon the
quantity of gold which it would exchange for. This difference, however,
would be altogether owing to the custom of keeping accounts, and of
expressing the amount of all great and small sums rather in silver than
in gold money. One of Mr. Drummond’s notes for five-and-twenty or fifty
guineas would, after an alteration of this kind, be still payable with
five-and-twenty or fifty guineas in the same manner as before. It would,
 after such an alteration, be payable with the same quantity of gold as
before, but with very different <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>43<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 quantities of silver. In the payment of such a note, gold would appear
to be more invariable in its value than silver. Gold would appear to
measure the value of silver, and silver would not appear to measure the
value of gold. If the custom of keeping accounts, and of expressing
promissory notes and other obligations for money in this manner, should
ever become general, gold, and not silver, would be considered as the
metal which was peculiarly the standard or measure of value.</p>

 Twelve copper pence contain half a pound, avoirdupois, of copper, of
not the best quality, which, before it is coined, is seldom worth
sevenpence in silver. But as by the regulation twelve such pence are
ordered to exchange for a shilling, they are in the market considered as
 worth a shilling, and a shilling can at any time be had for them. Even
before the late reformation of the gold coin of Great Britain,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt216" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt216_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 the gold, that part of it at least which circulated in London and its
neighbourhood, was in general less degraded below its standard weight
than the greater part of the silver. One-and-twenty worn and defaced
shillings, however, were considered as equivalent to a guinea, which
perhaps, indeed, was worn and defaced too, but seldom so much so. The
late regulations<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt217" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt217_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 have brought the gold coin as near perhaps to its standard weight as it
 is possible to bring the current coin of any nation; and the order, to
receive no gold at the public offices but by weight, is likely to
preserve it so, as long as that order is enforced. The silver coin still
 continues in the same worn and degraded state as before the reformation
 of the gold coin. In the market, however, one-and-twenty shillings of
this degraded silver coin are still considered as worth a guinea of this
 excellent gold coin.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_306">The reformation of the gold coin has evidently raised the value of<span class="type-margin"><span>where the reformation of the gold coin has raised the value of the silver coin.</span></span> the silver coin which can be exchanged for it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_307">In the English mint a pound weight of gold is
coined into forty-four guineas and a half, which, at one-and-twenty
shillings the guinea, is equal to forty-six pounds fourteen shillings
and six-pence. An ounce of such gold coin, therefore, is worth 3 <span class="ital">l.</span> 17 <span class="ital">s.</span> 10½ <span class="ital">d.</span> in silver. In <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>44<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 England no duty or seignorage is paid upon the coinage, and he who
carries a pound weight or an ounce weight of standard gold bullion to
the mint, gets back a pound weight or an ounce weight of gold in coin,
without any deduction. Three pounds seventeen shillings and tenpence
halfpenny an ounce, therefore, is said to be the mint price of gold in
England, or the quantity of gold coin which the mint gives in return for
 standard gold bullion.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_308">Before the reformation of the gold coin, the price of standard gold bullion in the market had for many years been upwards of 3 <span class="ital">l.</span> 18 <span class="ital">s.</span> sometimes 3 <span class="ital">l.</span> 19 <span class="ital">s.</span> and very frequently 4 <span class="ital">l.</span>
 an ounce; that sum, it is probable, in the worn and degraded gold coin,
 seldom containing more than an ounce of standard gold. Since the
reformation of the gold coin, the market price of standard gold bullion
seldom exceeds 3 <span class="ital">l.</span> 17 <span class="ital">s.</span> 7 <span class="ital">d.</span>
 an ounce. Before the reformation of the gold coin, the market price was
 always more or less above the mint price. Since that reformation, the
market price has been constantly below the mint price. But that market
price is the same whether it is paid in gold or in silver coin. The late
 reformation of the gold coin, therefore, has raised not only the value
of the gold coin, but likewise that of the silver coin in proportion to
gold bullion, and probably too in proportion to all other commodities;
though the price of the greater part of other commodities being
influenced by so many other causes, the rise in the value either of gold
 or silver coin in proportion to them, may not be so distinct and
sensible.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_309">In the English mint a pound weight of standard
 silver bullion is coined into sixty-two shillings, containing, in the
same manner, a pound weight of standard silver. Five shillings and
two-pence an ounce, therefore, is said to be the mint price of silver in
 England, or the quantity of silver coin which the mint gives in return
for standard silver bullion. Before the reformation of the gold coin,
the market price of standard silver bullion was, upon different
occasions, five shillings and four-pence, five shillings and five-pence,
 five shillings and six-pence, five shillings and seven-pence, and very
often five shillings and eight-pence an ounce. Five shillings and
seven-pence, however, seems to have been the most common price. Since
the reformation of the gold coin, the market price of standard silver
bullion has fallen occasionally to five shillings and three-pence, five
shillings and four-pence, and five shillings and five-pence an ounce,
which last price it has scarce ever exceeded. Though the market price of
 silver bullion has fallen considerably since the reformation of the
gold coin, it has not fallen so low as the mint price.</p>

<p id="Smith_0206-01_310">In the proportion between the different metals in the English coin,<span class="type-margin"><span>Silver is rated below its value in England.</span></span>
 as copper is rated very much above its real value, so silver is rated
somewhat below it. In the market of Europe, in the French coin and in
the Dutch coin, an ounce of fine gold exchanges for about fourteen
ounces of fine silver. In the English coin, it exchanges for about
fifteen ounces, that is, for more silver than it is worth according to
the common estimation of Europe.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt218" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt218_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 But as the price of copper in bars is not, even in England, raised by
the high price of copper in English coin, so the price of silver in
bullion is not sunk by the low rate of silver in English coin. Silver in
 bullion still preserves its proper proportion to gold; for the same
reason that copper in bars preserves its proper proportion to silver.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt219" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt219_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_311">Upon the reformation of the silver coin in the reign of William III.<span class="type-margin"><span>Locke’s explanation of the high price of silver bullion is wrong.</span></span>
 the price of silver bullion still continued to be somewhat above the
mint price. Mr. Locke imputed this high price to the permission of
exporting silver bullion, and to the prohibition of exporting silver
coin.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt220" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt220_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 This permission of exporting, he said, rendered the demand for silver
bullion greater than the demand for silver coin. But the number of
people who want silver coin for the common uses of buying and selling at
 home, is surely much greater than that of those who want silver bullion
 either for the use of exportation or for any other use. There subsists
at present a like permission of exporting gold bullion, and a like
prohibition of exporting gold coin; and yet the price of gold bullion
has fallen below the mint price. But in the English coin silver was
then, in the same manner as now, under-rated in proportion to gold; and
the gold coin (which at that time too was not supposed to require any
reformation) regulated then, as well as now, the real value of the whole
 coin. As the reformation of the silver coin did not then reduce the
price of silver bullion to the mint price, it is not very probable that a
 like reformation will do so now.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_312">Were the silver coin brought back as near to its standard weight as<span class="type-margin"><span>If the silver coin were reformed, it would be melted.</span></span>
 the gold, a guinea, it is probable, would, according to the present
proportion, exchange for more silver in coin than it would purchase in <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>46<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 bullion. The silver coin containing its full standard weight, there
would in this case be a profit in melting it down, in order, first, to
sell the bullion for gold coin, and afterwards to exchange this gold
coin for silver coin to be melted down in the same manner. Some
alteration in the present proportion seems to be the only method of
preventing this inconveniency.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_313"><span class="type-margin"><span>Silver ought to be rated higher and should not be legal tender for more than a guinea.</span></span>The
 inconveniency perhaps would be less if silver was rated in the coin as
much above its proper proportion to gold as it is at present rated below
 it; provided it was at the same time enacted that silver should not be a
 legal tender for more than the change of a guinea; in the same manner
as copper is not a legal tender for more than the change of a shilling.
No creditor could in this case be cheated in consequence of the high
valuation of silver in coin; as no creditor can at present be cheated in
 consequence of the high valuation of copper. The bankers only would
suffer by this regulation. When a run comes upon them they sometimes
endeavour to gain time by paying in six-pences, and they would be
precluded by this regulation from this discreditable method of evading
immediate payment. They would be obliged in consequence to keep at all
times in their coffers a greater quantity of cash than at present; and
though this might no doubt be a considerable inconveniency to them, it
would at the same time be a considerable security to their creditors.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt221" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt221_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_314"><span class="type-margin"><span>If it were properly rated, silver bullion would fall below the mint price without any re-coinage.</span></span>Three
 pounds seventeen shillings and ten-pence halfpenny (the mint price of
gold) certainly does not contain, even in our present excellent gold
coin, more than an ounce of standard gold, and it may be thought,
therefore, should not purchase more standard bullion. But gold in coin
is more convenient than gold in bullion, and though, in England, the
coinage is free, yet the gold which is carried in bullion to the mint,
can seldom be returned in coin to the owner till after a delay of
several weeks. In the present hurry of the mint, it could not be
returned till after a delay of several months. This delay is equivalent
to a small duty, and renders gold in coin somewhat more valuable than an
 equal quantity of gold in bullion.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt222" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt222_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 If in the English coin silver was rated according to its proper
proportion to gold, the price of silver bullion would probably fall
below the mint price even without any reformation of the silver coin;
the value even of the present worn and defaced silver coin being
regulated by the value of the excellent gold coin for which it can be
changed.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>47<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_315">A small seignorage or duty upon the coinage of both gold and silver<span class="type-margin"><span>A seignorage would prevent melting and discourage exportation.</span></span>
 would probably increase still more the superiority of those metals in
coin above an equal quantity of either of them in bullion. The coinage
would in this case increase the value of the metal coined in proportion
to the extent of this small duty; for the same reason that the fashion
increases the value of plate in proportion to the price of that fashion.
 The superiority of coin above bullion would prevent the melting down of
 the coin, and would discourage its exportation. If upon any public
exigency it should become necessary to export the coin, the greater part
 of it would soon return again of its own accord. Abroad it could sell
only for its weight in bullion. At home it would buy more than that
weight. There would be a profit, therefore, in bringing it home again.
In France a seignorage of about eight per cent. is imposed upon the
coinage,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt223" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt223_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> and the French coin, when exported, is said to return home again of its own accord.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt224" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt224_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_316">The occasional fluctuations in the market price of gold and silver<span class="type-margin"><span>Fluctuations
 in the market price of gold and silver are due to ordinary commercial
causes, but steady divergence from mint price is due to the state of the
 coin.</span></span> bullion arise from the same causes as the like
fluctuations in that of all other commodities. The frequent loss of
those metals from various accidents by sea and by land, the continual
waste of them in gilding and plating, in lace and embroidery, in the
wear and tear of coin, and in that of plate;<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt225" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt225_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 require, in all countries which possess no mines of their own, a
continual importation, in order to repair this loss and this waste. The
merchant importers, like all other merchants, we may believe, endeavour,
 as well as they can, to suit their occasional importations to what,
they judge, is likely to be the immediate demand. With all their
attention, however, they sometimes over-do the business, and sometimes
under-do it. When they import more bullion than is wanted, rather than
incur the risk and trouble of exporting it again, they are sometimes
willing to sell a part of it for something less than the ordinary or
average price. When, on the other hand, they import less than is wanted,
 they get something more than this price. But when, under all those
occasional fluctuations, the market price either of gold or silver
bullion continues for several years together steadily and constantly,
either more or less above, or more or less below the mint price: we may
be assured that this steady and constant, either superiority or
inferiority of price, is the effect of something in the state of the
coin, which, at that time, renders a certain quantity of coin either of
more <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>48<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 value or of less value than the precise quantity of bullion which it
ought to contain. The constancy and steadiness of the effect, supposes a
 proportionable constancy and steadiness in the cause.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_317"><span class="type-margin"><span>The price of goods is adjusted to the actual contents of the coinage.</span></span>The
 money of any particular country is, at any particular time and place,
more or less an accurate measure of value according as the current coin
is more or less exactly agreeable to its standard, or contains more or
less exactly the precise quantity of pure gold or pure silver which it
ought to contain. If in England, for example, forty-four guineas and a
half contained exactly a pound weight of standard gold, or eleven ounces
 of fine gold and one ounce of alloy, the gold coin of England would be
as accurate a measure of the actual value of goods at any particular
time and place as the nature of the thing would admit. But if, by
rubbing and wearing, forty-four guineas and a half generally contain
less than a pound weight of standard gold; the diminution, however,
being greater in some pieces than in others; the measure of value comes
to be liable to the same sort of uncertainty to which all other weights
and measures are commonly exposed. As it rarely happens that these are
exactly agreeable to their standard, the merchant adjusts the price of
his goods, as well as he can, not to what those weights and measures
ought to be, but to what, upon an average, he finds by experience they
actually are. In consequence of a like disorder in the coin, the price
of goods comes, in the same manner, to be adjusted, not to the quantity
of pure gold or silver which the coin ought to contain, but to that
which, upon an average, it is found by experience it actually does
contain.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_318">By the money-price of goods, it is to be
observed, I understand always the quantity of pure gold or silver for
which they are sold, without any regard to the denomination of the coin.
 Six shillings and eight-pence, for example, in the time of Edward I., I
 consider as the same money-price with a pound sterling in the present
times; because it contained, as nearly as we can judge, the same
quantity of pure silver.</p>

<h2 id="lf0206-01_label_271">CHAPTER VI: OF THE COMPONENT PARTS OF THE PRICE OF COMMODITIES</h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-01_319">IN that early and rude state of society which precedes both the<span class="type-margin"><span>Quantity of labour is originally the only rule of value,</span></span>
 accumulation of stock and the appropriation of land, the proportion
between the quantities of labour necessary for acquiring different
objects seems to be the only circumstance which can afford any rule for
exchanging them for one another. If among a nation of hunters, for
example, it usually costs twice the labour to kill a beaver which it
does to kill a deer, one beaver should naturally exchange for or be
worth two deer. It is natural that what is usually the produce of two
days or two hours labour, should be worth double of what is usually the
produce of one day’s or one hour’s labour.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_320">If the one species of labour should be more severe than the other,<span class="type-margin"><span>allowance being made for superior hardship,</span></span>
 some allowance will naturally be made for this superior hardship; and
the produce of one hour’s labour in the one way may frequently exchange
for that of two hours labour in the other.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_321">Or if the one species of labour requires an uncommon degree of<span class="type-margin"><span>and for uncommon dexterity and ingenuity.</span></span>
 dexterity and ingenuity, the esteem which men have for such talents,
will naturally give a value to their produce, superior to what would be
due to the time employed about it. Such talents can seldom be acquired
but in consequence of long application, and the superior value of their
produce may frequently be no more than a reasonable compensation for the
 time and labour which must be spent in acquiring them. In the advanced
state of society, allowances of this kind, for superior hardship and
superior skill, are commonly made in the wages of labour; and something
of the same kind must probably have taken place in its earliest and
rudest period.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_322">In this state of things, the whole produce of labour belongs to the<span class="type-margin"><span>The whole produce then belongs to the labourer,</span></span> labourer; and<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt226" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt226_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> the quantity of labour commonly employed in acquiring <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>50<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 or producing any commodity, is the only circumstance which can regulate
 the quantity of labour which it ought commonly to purchase, command, or
 exchange for.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_323"><span class="type-margin"><span>but when stock
 is used, something must be given for the profits of the undertaker, and
 the value of work resolves itself into wages and profits.</span></span>As
 soon as stock has accumulated in the hands of particular persons, some
of them will naturally employ it in setting to work industrious people,
whom they will supply with materials and subsistence, in order to make a
 profit by the sale of their work, or by what their labour adds to the
value of the materials. In exchanging the complete manufacture either
for money, for labour, or for other goods, over and above what may be
sufficient to pay the price of the materials, and the wages of the
workmen, something must be given for the profits of the undertaker of
the work who hazards his stock in this adventure. The value which the
workmen add to the materials, therefore, resolves itself in this case
into two parts, of which the one pays their wages, the other the profits
 of their employer upon the whole stock of materials and wages which he
advanced. He could have no interest to employ them, unless he expected
from the sale of their work something more than what was sufficient to
replace his stock to him; and he could have no interest to employ a
great stock rather than a small one, unless his profits were to bear
some proportion to the extent of his stock.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_324"><span class="type-margin"><span>Profits are not merely wages of inspection and direction.</span></span>The
 profits of stock, it may perhaps be thought, are only a different name
for the wages of a particular sort of labour, the labour of inspection
and direction. They are, however, altogether different, are regulated by
 quite different principles, and bear no proportion to the quantity, the
 hardship, or the ingenuity of this supposed labour of inspection and
direction. They are regulated altogether by the value of the stock
employed, and are greater or smaller in proportion to the extent of this
 stock. Let us suppose, for example, that in some particular place,
where the common annual profits of manufacturing stock are ten per cent.
 there are two different manufactures, in each of which twenty workmen
are employed at the rate of fifteen pounds a year each, or at the
expence of three hundred a year in each manufactory. Let us suppose too,
 that the coarse materials annually wrought up in the one cost only
seven hundred pounds, while the finer materials in the other cost seven
thousand. The capital annually employed<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt227" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt227_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 in the one will in this case amount only to one thousand pounds;
whereas that employed in the other will amount to seven thousand three
hundred pounds. At the rate of ten per cent. therefore, the undertaker
of the one will expect an yearly profit of about one hundred <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>51<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 pounds only; while that of the other will expect about seven hundred
and thirty pounds. But though their profits are so very different, their
 labour of inspection and direction may be either altogether or very
nearly the same. In many great works, almost the whole labour of this
kind is<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt228" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt228_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 committed to some principal clerk. His wages properly express the value
 of this labour of inspection and direction. Though in settling them
some regard is had commonly, not only to his labour and skill, but to
the trust which is reposed in him, yet they never bear any regular
proportion to the capital of which he oversees the management; and the
owner of this capital, though he is thus discharged of almost all
labour, still expects that his profits should bear a regular proportion
to his capital.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt229" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt229_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> In the price of commodities, therefore, the profits of stock constitute a component part<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt230" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt230_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> altogether different from the wages of labour, and regulated by quite different principles.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_325">In this state of things, the whole produce of labour does not always<span class="type-margin"><span>The labourer shares with the employer, and labour alone no longer regulates value.</span></span>
 belong to the labourer. He must in most cases share it with the owner
of the stock which employs him. Neither is the quantity of labour
commonly employed in acquiring or producing any commodity, the only
circumstance<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt231" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt231_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 which can regulate the quantity which it ought commonly to purchase,
command, or exchange for. An additional quantity, it is evident, must be
 due for the profits of the stock which advanced the wages and furnished
 the materials of that labour.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_326">As soon as the land of any country has all become private property,<span class="type-margin"><span>When land has all become private property, rent constitutes a third component part of the price of most commodities.</span></span> the landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt232" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt232_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a>
 and demand a rent even for its natural produce. The wood of the forest,
 the grass of the field, and all the natural fruits of the earth, which,
 when land was in common, cost the labourer only the trouble of
gathering them, come, even to him,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt233" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt233_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">6</a>
 to have an additional price fixed upon them. He must then pay for the
licence to gather them; and must give up to the landlord a portion of
what his labour either collects or produces. This portion, or, what
comes to the same thing, the price of this portion, constitutes the rent
 of land, and in the price of the greater part of commodities makes a
third component part.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt234" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt234_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">7</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>52<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_327"><span class="type-margin"><span>The real value of all three parts is measured by labour.</span></span>The real value of all the different component parts of price, it must be observed, is measured<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt235" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt235_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 by the quantity of labour which they can, each of them, purchase or
command. Labour measures the value not only of that part of price which
resolves itself into labour, but of that which resolves itself into
rent, and of that which resolves itself into profit.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_328"><span class="type-margin"><span>In an improved society all three parts are generally present,</span></span>In
 every society the price of every commodity finally resolves itself into
 some one or other, or all of those three parts; and in every improved
society, all the three enter more or less, as component parts, into the
price of the far greater part of commodities.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_329"><span class="type-margin"><span>for example, in corn,</span></span>In
 the price of corn, for example, one part pays the rent of the landlord,
 another pays the wages or maintenance of the labourers and labouring
cattle<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt236" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt236_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 employed in producing it, and the third pays the profit of the farmer.
These three parts seem either immediately or ultimately to make up the
whole price of corn. A fourth part, it may perhaps be thought, is
necessary for replacing the stock of the farmer, or for compensating the
 wear and tear<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt237" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt237_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 of his labouring cattle, and other instruments of husbandry. But it
must be considered that the price of any instrument of husbandry, such
as a labouring horse, is itself made up of the same three parts; the
rent of the land upon which he is reared, the labour of tending and
rearing him, and the profits of the farmer who advances both the rent of
 this land, and the wages of this labour. Though the price of the corn,
therefore, may pay the price as well as the maintenance of the horse,
the whole price still resolves itself either immediately or ultimately
into the same three parts of rent, labour,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt238" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt238_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> and profit.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>53<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_330">In the price of flour or meal, we must add to the price of the corn,<span class="type-margin"><span>in flour or meal,</span></span>
 the profits of the miller, and the wages of his servants; in the price
of bread, the profits of the baker, and the wages of his servants; and
in the price of both, the labour of transporting the corn from the house
 of the farmer to that of the miller, and from that of the miller to
that of the baker, together with the profits of those who advance the
wages of that labour.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_331">The price of flax resolves itself into the same three parts as that of<span class="type-margin"><span>and in flax.</span></span>
 corn. In the price of linen we must add to this price the wages of the
flax-dresser, of the spinner, of the weaver, of the bleacher, &amp;c.
together with the profits of their respective employers.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_332">As any particular commodity comes to be more manufactured, that<span class="type-margin"><span>Rent is a smaller proportion in highly manufactured commodities.</span></span>
 part of the price which resolves itself into wages and profit, comes to
 be greater in proportion to that which resolves itself into rent. In
the progress of the manufacture, not only the number of profits
increase, but every subsequent profit is greater than the foregoing;
because the capital from which it is derived must always be greater. The
 capital which employs the weavers, for example, must be greater than
that which employs the spinners; because it not only replaces that
capital with its profits, but pays, besides, the wages of the weavers;
and the profits must always bear some proportion to the capital.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt239" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt239_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_333">In the most improved societies, however, there are always a few<span class="type-margin"><span>A few commodities have only two or even one of the three component parts.</span></span>
 commodities of which the price resolves itself into two parts only, the
 wages of labour, and the profits of stock; and a still smaller number,
in which it consists altogether in the wages of labour. In the price of
sea-fish, for example, one part pays the labour of the fishermen, and
the other the profits of the capital employed in the fishery. Rent very
seldom makes any part of it, though it does sometimes, as I shall shew
hereafter.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt240" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt240_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 It is otherwise, at least through the greater part of Europe, in river
fisheries. A salmon fishery pays a rent, and rent, though it cannot well
 be called the rent of land, makes a part of the price of a salmon as
well as wages and profit. In some parts of Scotland a few poor people
make a trade of gathering, along the sea-shore, those little variegated
stones commonly known by the name of Scotch Pebbles. The price which is
paid to them by the stone-cutter is altogether the wages of their
labour; neither rent nor profit make any part of it.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>54<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_334"><span class="type-margin"><span>But all must have at least one,</span></span>But
 the whole price of any commodity must still finally resolve itself into
 some one or other, or all of those three parts; as whatever part of it
remains after paying the rent of the land, and the price of the whole
labour employed in raising, manufacturing, and bringing it to market,
must necessarily be profit to somebody.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt241" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt241_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_335"><span class="type-margin"><span>and the price of the whole annual produce resolves itself into wages, profits and rent,</span></span>As
 the price or exchangeable value of every particular commodity, taken
separately, resolves itself into some one or other, or all of those
three parts; so that of all the commodities which compose the whole
annual produce of the labour of every country, taken complexly, must
resolve itself into the same three parts, and be parcelled out among
different inhabitants of the country, either as the wages of their
labour, the profits of their stock, or the rent of their land.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt242" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt242_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 The whole of what is annually either collected or produced by the
labour of every society, or what comes to the same thing, the whole
price of it, is in this manner originally distributed among some of its
different members. Wages, profit, and rent, are the three original
sources of all revenue as well as of all exchangeable value. All other
revenue<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt243" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt243_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> is ultimately derived from some one or other of these.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_336"><span class="type-margin"><span>which are the only original kinds of revenue.</span></span>Whoever
 derives his revenue from a fund which is his own, must draw it either
from his labour, from his stock, or from his land. The revenue derived
from labour is called wages. That derived from stock, by the person who
manages or employs it, is called profit. That derived from it by the
person who does not employ it himself, but lends it to another, is
called the interest or the use of money. It is the compensation which
the borrower pays to the lender, for the profit which he has an
opportunity of making by the use of the money. Part of that profit
naturally belongs to the borrower, who runs the risk and takes the
trouble of employing it; and part to the lender, who affords him the
opportunity of making this profit. The interest of money is always a
derivative revenue, which, if it is not paid from the profit which is
made by the use of the money, must be paid from some other source of
revenue, unless perhaps the borrower is a spendthrift, who contracts a
second debt in order to pay the interest of the first. The revenue which
 proceeds altogether from land, is called rent, and belongs to the
landlord. The revenue of the farmer is derived partly from his labour,
and partly from his stock. To him, land is only the instrument which
enables him to earn the wages of this labour, and to make the profits <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>55<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of this stock. All taxes, and all the revenue which is founded upon
them, all salaries, pensions, and annuities of every kind, are
ultimately derived from some one or other of those three original
sources of revenue, and are paid either immediately or mediately from
the wages of labour, the profits of stock, or the rent of land.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_337">When those three different sorts of revenue belong to different<span class="type-margin"><span>They are sometimes confounded,</span></span>
 persons, they are readily distinguished; but when they belong to the
same they are sometimes confounded with one another, at least in common
language.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_338">A gentleman who farms a part of his own estate, after paying the<span class="type-margin"><span>for example, a gentleman farmer’s rent is called profit,</span></span>
 expence of cultivation, should gain both the rent of the landlord and
the profit of the farmer. He is apt to denominate, however, his whole
gain, profit, and thus confounds rent with profit, at least in common
language. The greater part of our North American and West Indian
planters are in this situation. They farm, the greater part of them,
their own estates, and accordingly we seldom hear of the rent of a
plantation, but frequently of its profit.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_339">Common farmers seldom employ any overseer to direct the general<span class="type-margin"><span>a common farmer’s wages are called profit,</span></span>
 operations of the farm. They generally too work a good deal with their
own hands, as ploughmen, harrowers, &amp;c. What remains of the crop
after paying the rent, therefore, should not only replace to them their
stock employed in cultivation, together with its ordinary profits, but
pay them the wages which are due to them, both as labourers and
overseers. Whatever remains, however, after paying the rent and keeping
up the stock, is called profit. But wages evidently make a part of it.
The farmer, by saving these wages, must necessarily gain them. Wages,
therefore, are in this case confounded with profit.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_340">An independent manufacturer, who has stock enough both to purchase<span class="type-margin"><span>and so are an independent manufacturer’s wages,</span></span>
 materials, and to maintain himself till he can carry his work to
market, should gain both the wages of a journeyman who works under a
master, and the profit which that master makes by the sale of the
journeyman’s work.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt244" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt244_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> His whole gains, however, are commonly called profit, and wages are, in this case too, confounded with profit.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt245" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt245_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_341">A gardener who cultivates his own garden with his own hands,<span class="type-margin"><span>while the rent and profit of a gardener cultivating his own land are considered earnings of labour.</span></span>
 unites in his own person the three different characters, of landlord,
farmer, and labourer. His produce, therefore, should pay him the rent of
 the first, the profit of the second, and the wages of the third. The
whole, however, is commonly considered as the earnings of his labour.
Both rent and profit are, in this case, confounded with wages.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>56<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_342"><span class="type-margin"><span>A great part of the annual produce goes to the idle; the proportion regulates the increase or diminution of the produce.</span></span>As
 in a civilized country there are but few commodities of which the
exchangeable value arises from labour only, rent and profit contributing
 largely to that of the far greater part of them, so the annual produce
of its labour will always be sufficient to purchase or command a much
greater quantity of labour than what was employed in raising, preparing,
 and bringing that produce to market. If the society were<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt246" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt246_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 annually to employ all the labour which it can annually purchase, as
the quantity of labour would increase greatly every year, so the produce
 of every succeeding year would be of vastly greater value than that of
the foregoing. But there is no country in which the whole annual produce
 is employed in maintaining the industrious. The idle every where
consume a great part of it; and according to the different proportions
in which it is annually divided between those two different orders of
people, its ordinary or average value must either annually increase, or
diminish, or continue the same from one year to another.</p>

<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-01_343">THERE is in every society or neighbourhood an ordinary or average<span class="type-margin"><span>Ordinary or average rates of wages, profit,</span></span>
 rate both of wages and profit in every different employment of labour

 partly by the general circumstances of the society, their riches or

 partly by the general circumstances of the society or neighbourhood in
which the land is situated, and partly by the natural or improved
fertility of the land.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_345">These ordinary or average rates may be called the natural rates of<span class="type-margin"><span>may be called natural rates,</span></span> wages, profit, and rent, at the time and place in which they commonly prevail.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_346">When the price of any commodity is neither more nor less than<span class="type-margin"><span>to pay which a commodity is sold at its natural price,</span></span>
 what is sufficient to pay the rent of the land, the wages of the
labour, and the profits of the stock employed in raising, preparing, and
 bringing it to market, according to their natural rates, the commodity
is then sold for what may be called its natural price.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_347">The commodity is then sold precisely for what it is worth, or for<span class="type-margin"><span>or for what it really costs, which includes profit,</span></span>
 what it really costs the person who brings it to market; for though in
common language what is called the prime cost of any commodity does not
comprehend the profit of the person who is to sell it again, yet if he
sells it at a price which does not allow him the ordinary rate of profit
 in his neighbourhood, he is evidently a loser by the trade; since by
employing his stock in some other way he might have made that profit.
His profit, besides, is his revenue, the proper fund of his <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>58<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 subsistence. As, while he is preparing and bringing the goods to
market, he advances to his workmen their wages, or their subsistence; so
 he advances to himself, in the same manner, his own subsistence, which
is generally suitable to the profit which he may reasonably expect from
the sale of his goods. Unless they yield him this profit, therefore,
they do not repay him what they may very properly be said to have really
 cost him.</p>

where there is perfect liberty,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt250" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt250_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> or where he may change his trade as often as he pleases.</p>

called the effectual demanders, and their demand the effectual demand;
since it may be sufficient to effectuate the bringing of the commodity
to market. It is different from the absolute demand. A very poor man may
 be said in some sense to have a demand for a coach and six; he might
like to have it; but his demand is not an effectual demand, as the
commodity can never be brought to market in order to satisfy it.</p>

 the quantity of any commodity which is brought to market falls short of
 the effectual demand, all those who are willing to pay the whole value
of the rent, wages, and profit, which must be paid in order to bring it
thither, cannot be supplied with the quantity which they want. Rather
than want it altogether, some of them will be willing to give more. A
competition will immediately begin among them, and the market price will
 rise more or less above the natural price, according as either the
greatness of the deficiency, or the wealth and wanton luxury of the
competitors, happen to animate more or less the eagerness of the
competition. Among competitors of equal wealth and luxury the same
deficiency<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt252" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt252_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> will generally occasion a more or less <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>59<span class="bracket">]</span></span> eager competition, according as the acquisition of the commodity happens to be of more or less importance to them.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt253" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt253_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> Hence the exorbitant price of the necessaries of life during the blockade of a town or in a famine.</p>

 it cannot be all sold to those who are willing to pay the whole value
of the rent, wages and profit, which must be paid in order to bring it
thither. Some part must be sold to those who are willing to pay less,
and the low price which they give for it must reduce the price of the
whole. The market price will sink more or less below the natural price,
according as the greatness of the excess increases more or less the
competition of the sellers, or according as it happens to be more or
less important to them to get immediately rid of the commodity. The same
 excess in the importation of perishable, will occasion a much greater
competition than in that of durable commodities; in the importation of
oranges, for example, than in that of old iron.</p>

either exactly, or as nearly as can be judged of, the same with the
natural price. The whole quantity upon hand can be disposed of for this
price, and cannot be disposed of for more. The competition of the
different dealers obliges them all to accept of this price, but does not
 oblige them to accept of less.</p>

employ their land, labour, or stock, in bringing any commodity to
market, that the quantity never should exceed the effectual demand; and
it is the interest of all other people that it never should fall short
of that demand.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt254" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt254_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>

rent, the interest of the landlords will immediately prompt them to
withdraw a part of their land; and if it is wages or profit, the
interest of the labourers in the one case, and of their employers in the
 other, will prompt them to withdraw a part of their labour or stock
from this employment. The quantity brought to market will soon be no
more than sufficient to supply the effectual demand. All the different

 on the contrary, the quantity brought to market should at any time fall

raising of this commodity; if it is wages or profit, the interest of all
 other labourers and dealers will soon prompt them to employ more labour
 and stock in preparing and bringing it to market. The quantity brought
thither will soon be sufficient to supply the effectual demand. All the
different parts of its price will soon sink to their natural rate, and
the whole price to its natural price.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_357"><span class="type-margin"><span>Natural price is the central price to which actual prices gravitate.</span></span>The
 natural price, therefore, is, as it were, the central price, to which
the prices of all commodities are continually gravitating. Different
accidents may sometimes keep them suspended a good deal above it, and
sometimes force them down even somewhat below it. But whatever may be
the obstacles which hinder them from settling in this center of repose
and continuance, they are constantly tending towards it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_358"><span class="type-margin"><span>Industry suits itself to the effectual demand,</span></span>The
 whole quantity of industry annually employed in order to bring any
commodity to market, naturally suits itself in this manner to the
effectual demand. It naturally aims at bringing always that precise
quantity thither which may be sufficient to supply, and no more than
supply, that demand.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_359"><span class="type-margin"><span>but the quantity produced by a given amount of industry sometimes fluctuates.</span></span>But in some employments the same quantity of industry will in different years produce very different quantities of commodities;<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt255" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt255_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 while in others it will produce always the same, or very nearly the
same. The same number of labourers in husbandry will, in different
years, produce very different quantities of corn, wine, oil, hops,
&amp;c. But the same number of spinners and weavers will every year
produce the same or very nearly the same quantity of linen and woollen
cloth. It is only the average produce of the one species of industry
which can be suited in any respect to the effectual demand; and as its
actual produce is frequently much greater and frequently much less than
its average produce, the quantity of the commodities brought to market
will sometimes exceed a good deal, and sometimes fall short a good deal,
 of the effectual demand. Even though that demand therefore should
continue always the same, their market price will be liable to great
fluctuations, will sometimes fall a good deal below, and sometimes rise a
 good deal above, their natural price. In the other species of industry,
 the produce of equal quantities of labour being always the same, or
very nearly the same, it can be more exactly suited to the effectual
demand. While <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>61<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 that demand continues the same, therefore, the market price of the
commodities is likely to do so too, and to be either altogether, or as
nearly as can be judged of, the same with the natural price. That the
price of linen and woollen cloth is liable neither to such frequent nor
to such great variations as the price of corn, every man’s experience
will inform him. The price of the one species of commodities varies only
 with the variations in the demand: That of the other varies not only
with the variations in the demand, but with the much greater and more
frequent variations in the quantity of what is brought to market in
order to supply that demand.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_360">The occasional and temporary fluctuations in the market price of any<span class="type-margin"><span>The fluctuations fall on wages and profit more than on rent,</span></span>
 commodity fall chiefly upon those parts of its price which resolve
themselves into wages and profit. That part which resolves itself into
rent is less affected by them. A rent certain in money is not in the
least affected by them either in its rate or in its value. A rent which
consists either in a certain proportion or in a certain quantity of the
rude produce, is no doubt affected in its yearly value by all the
occasional and temporary fluctuations in the market price of that rude
produce; but it is seldom affected by them in its yearly rate. In
settling the terms of the lease, the landlord and farmer endeavour,
according to their best judgment, to adjust that rate, not to the
temporary and occasional, but to the average and ordinary price of the
produce.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_361">Such fluctuations affect both the value and the rate either of wages<span class="type-margin"><span>affecting them in different proportions according to the supply of commodities and labour.</span></span>
 or of profit, according as the market happens to be either over-stocked
 or under-stocked with commodities or with labour; with work done, or
with work to be done. A public mourning raises the price of black cloth<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt256" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt256_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 (with which the market is almost always under-stocked upon such
occasions), and augments the profits of the merchants who possess any
considerable quantity of it. It has no effect upon the wages of the
weavers. The market is under-stocked with commodities, not with labour;
with work done, not with work to be done. It raises the wages of
journeymen taylors. The market is here under-stocked with labour. There
is an effectual demand for more<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt257" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt257_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 labour, for more work to be done than can be had. It sinks the price of
 coloured silks and cloths, and thereby reduces the profits of the
merchants who have any considerable quantity of them upon hand. It sinks
 too the wages of the workmen employed in preparing such commodities,
for which all demand is stopped for six months, perhaps for a
twelvemonth. The market is here over-stocked both with commodities and
with labour.</p>

 though the market price of every particular commodity is in this manner
 continually gravitating, if one may say so, towards the natural price,
yet sometimes particular accidents, sometimes natural causes, and
sometimes particular regulations of police, may, in many commodities,
keep up the market price, for a long time together, a good deal above
the natural price.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_363"><span class="type-margin"><span>in consequence of want of general knowledge of high profits,</span></span>When
 by an increase in the effectual demand, the market price of some
particular commodity happens to rise a good deal above the natural
price, those who employ their stocks in supplying that market are
generally careful to conceal this change. If it was commonly known,
their great profit would tempt so many new rivals to employ their stocks
 in the same way, that, the effectual demand being fully supplied, the
market price would soon be reduced to the natural price, and perhaps for
 some time even below it. If the market is at a great distance from the
residence of those who supply it, they may sometimes be able to keep the
 secret for several years together, and may so long enjoy their
extraordinary profits without any new rivals. Secrets of this kind,
however, it must be acknowledged, can seldom be long kept; and the
extraordinary profit can last very little longer than they are kept.</p>

 in manufactures are capable of being longer kept than secrets in trade.
 A dyer who has found the means of producing a particular colour with
materials which cost only half the price of those commonly made use of,
may, with good management, enjoy the advantage of his discovery as long
as he lives, and even leave it as a legacy to his posterity. His
extraordinary gains arise from the high price which is paid for his
private labour. They properly consist in the high wages of that labour.
But as they are repeated upon every part of his stock, and as their
whole amount bears, upon that account, a regular proportion to it, they
are commonly considered as extraordinary profits of stock.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt258" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt258_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>

last for many years together.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_366"><span class="type-margin"><span>or in consequence of scarcity of peculiar soils,</span></span>Some
 natural productions require such a singularity of soil and situation,
that all the land in a great country, which is fit for producing them,
may not be sufficient to supply the effectual demand. The <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>63<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 whole quantity brought to market, therefore, may be disposed of to
those who are willing to give more than what is sufficient to pay the
rent of the land which produced them, together with the wages of the
labour, and the profits of the stock which were employed in preparing
and bringing them to market, according to their natural rates. Such
commodities may continue for whole centuries together to be sold at this
 high price;<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt259" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt259_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 and that part of it which resolves itself into the rent of land is in
this case the part which is generally paid above its natural rate. The
rent of the land which affords such singular and esteemed productions,
like the rent of some vineyards in France of a peculiarly happy soil and
 situation, bears no regular proportion to the rent of other equally
fertile and equally well-cultivated land in its neighbourhood. The wages
 of the labour and the profits of the stock employed in bringing such
commodities to market, on the contrary, are seldom out of their natural
proportion to those of the other employments of labour and stock in
their neighbourhood.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_367">Such enhancements of the market price are evidently the effect of<span class="type-margin"><span>which may continue for ever.</span></span>
 natural causes which may hinder the effectual demand from ever being
fully supplied, and which may continue, therefore, to operate for ever.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_368">A monopoly granted either to an individual or to a trading company<span class="type-margin"><span>A monopoly has the same effect as a trade secret,</span></span>
 has the same effect as a secret in trade or manufactures. The
monopolists, by keeping the market constantly under-stocked, by never
fully supplying the effectual demand, sell their commodities much above
the natural price, and raise their emoluments, whether they consist in
wages or profit, greatly above their natural rate.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_369">The price of monopoly is upon every occasion the highest which can<span class="type-margin"><span>the price of monopoly being the highest which can be got.</span></span>
 be got. The natural price, or the price of free competition, on the
contrary, is the lowest which can be taken, not upon every occasion
indeed, but for any considerable time together. The one is upon every
occasion the highest which can be squeezed out of the buyers, or which,
it is supposed, they will consent to give: The other is the lowest which
 the sellers can commonly afford to take, and at the same time continue
their business.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_370">The exclusive privileges of corporations, statutes of apprenticeship,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt260" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt260_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a><span class="type-margin"><span>Corporation privileges, etc., are enlarged monopolies.</span></span>
 and all those laws which restrain, in particular employments, the
competition to a smaller number than might otherwise go into them, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>64<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 have the same tendency, though in a less degree. They are a sort of
enlarged monopolies, and may frequently, for ages together, and in whole
 classes of employments, keep up the market price of particular
commodities above the natural price, and maintain both the wages of the
labour and the profits of the stock employed about them somewhat above
their natural rate.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_371">Such enhancements of the market price may last as long as the regulations of police which give occasion to them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_372"><span class="type-margin"><span>Market price is seldom long below natural price,</span></span>The
 market price of any particular commodity, though it may continue long
above, can seldom continue long below, its natural price. Whatever part
of it was paid below the natural rate, the persons whose interest it
affected would immediately feel the loss, and would immediately withdraw
 either so much land, or so much labour, or so much stock, from being
employed about it, that the quantity brought to market would soon be no
more than sufficient to supply the effectual demand. Its market price,
therefore, would soon rise to the natural price. This at least would be
the case where there was perfect liberty.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt261" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt261_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_373"><span class="type-margin"><span>though apprenticeship and corporation laws sometimes reduce wages much below the natural rate for a certain period</span></span>The
 same statutes of apprenticeship and other corporation laws indeed,
which, when a manufacture is in prosperity, enable the workman to raise
his wages a good deal above their natural rate, sometimes oblige him,
when it decays, to let them down a good deal below it. As in the one
case they exclude many people from his employment, so in the other they
exclude him from many employments. The effect of such regulations,
however, is not near so durable in sinking the workman’s wages below, as
 in raising them above, their natural rate. Their operation in the one
way may endure for many centuries, but in the other it can last no
longer than the lives of some of the workmen who were bred to the
business in the time of its prosperity. When they are gone, the number
of those who are afterwards educated to the trade will naturally suit
itself to the effectual demand. The police must be as violent as that of
 Indostan or antient Egypt<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt262" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt262_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 (where every man was bound by a principle of religion to follow the
occupation of his father, and was supposed to commit the most horrid
sacrilege if he changed it for another), which can in any particular
employment, and for several generations together, sink either the wages
of labour or the profits of stock below their natural rate.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_374">This is all that I think necessary to be
observed at present concerning the deviations, whether occasional or

 component parts, of wages, profit, and rent; and in every society this
rate varies according to their circumstances, according to their riches
or poverty, their advancing, stationary, or declining condition. I
shall, in the four following chapters, endeavour to explain, as fully
and distinctly as I can, the causes of those different variations.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_376">First, I shall endeavour to explain what are the circumstances which<span class="type-margin"><span>Wages will be dealt with in chapter viii.,</span></span>

<p id="Smith_0206-01_377">Secondly, I shall endeavour to show what are the circumstances<span class="type-margin"><span>profit in chapter ix.,</span></span>
 which naturally determine the rate of profit, and in what manner too

<p id="Smith_0206-01_378">Though pecuniary wages and profit are very different in the different<span class="type-margin"><span>differences of wages and profit in chapter x.,</span></span>
 employments of labour and stock; yet a certain proportion seems
commonly to take place between both the pecuniary wages in all the
different employments of labour, and the pecuniary profits in all the
different employments of stock. This proportion, it will appear
hereafter, depends partly upon the nature of the different employments,
and partly upon the different laws and policy of the society in which
they are carried on. But though in many respects dependent upon the laws
 and policy, this proportion seems to be little affected by the riches
or poverty of that society; by its advancing, stationary, or declining
condition; but to remain the same or very nearly the same in all those
different states. I shall, in the third place, endeavour to explain all
the different circumstances which regulate this proportion.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_379">In the fourth and last place, I shall endeavour to show what are<span class="type-margin"><span>and rent in chapter xi.</span></span>
 the circumstances which regulate the rent of land, and which either

 They would have been produced by a smaller quantity of labour; and as
the commodities produced by equal quantities of labour would naturally
in this state of things be exchanged for one another, they would have
been purchased likewise with the produce of a smaller quantity.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_383"><span class="type-margin"><span>though in appearance many things might have become dearer.</span></span>But
 though all things would have become cheaper in reality, in appearance
many things might have become dearer than before, or have been exchanged
 for a greater quantity of other goods.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt265" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt265_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 Let us suppose, for example, that in the greater part of employments
the productive powers of labour had been improved to tenfold, or that a
day’s labour could produce ten times the quantity of work which it had
done originally; but that in a particular employment they had been
improved only to double, or that a day’s labour could produce only twice
 the quantity of work which it had done before. In exchanging the
produce of a day’s labour in the greater part of employments, for that
of a day’s labour in this particular one, ten times the original
quantity of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>67<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 work in them would purchase only twice the original quantity in it. Any
 particular quantity in it, therefore, a pound weight, for example,
would appear to be five times dearer than before.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt266" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt266_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> In reality,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt267" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt267_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 however, it would be twice as cheap. Though it required five times the
quantity of other goods to purchase it, it would require only half the
quantity of labour either to purchase or to produce it. The acquisition,
 therefore, would be twice as easy<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt268" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt268_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> as before.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_384">But this original state of things, in which the labourer enjoyed the<span class="type-margin"><span>This state was ended by the appropriation of land and accumulation of stock,</span></span>
 whole produce of his own labour, could not last beyond the first
introduction of the appropriation of land and the accumulation of stock.
 It was at an end, therefore, long before the most considerable
improvements were made in the productive powers of labour, and it would
be to no purpose to trace further what might have been its effects upon
the recompence or wages of labour.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_385">As soon as land becomes private property, the landlord demands a<span class="type-margin"><span>rent being the first deduction,</span></span> share of almost all the produce which<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt269" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt269_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 the labourer can either raise, or collect from it. His rent makes the
first deduction from the produce of the labour which is employed upon
land.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_386">It seldom happens that the person who tills the ground has wherewithal<span class="type-margin"><span>and profit the second, both in agriculture,</span></span>
 to maintain himself till he reaps the harvest. His maintenance is
generally advanced to him from the stock of a master, the farmer who
employs him, and who would have no interest to employ him, unless he was
 to share in the produce of his labour, or unless his stock was to be
replaced to him with a profit. This profit makes a second deduction from
 the produce of the labour which is employed upon land.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_387">The produce of almost all other labour is liable to the like deduction<span class="type-margin"><span>and other arts and manufactures.</span></span>

 stand in need of a master to advance them the materials of their work,

 and enjoys the whole produce of his own labour, or the whole value
which it adds to the materials upon which it is bestowed. It includes
what are usually two distinct revenues, belonging to two distinct
persons, the profits of stock, and the wages of labour.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_389"><span class="type-margin"><span>but this case is infrequent.</span></span>Such
 cases, however, are not very frequent, and in every part of Europe,
twenty workmen serve under a master for one that is independent; and the
 wages of labour are every where understood to be, what they usually
are, when the labourer is one person, and the owner of the stock which
employs him another.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_390"><span class="type-margin"><span>Wages depend on contract between masters and workmen.</span></span>What
 are the common wages of labour, depends every where upon the contract
usually made between those two parties, whose interests are by no means
the same. The workmen desire to get as much, the masters to give as
little as possible. The former are disposed to combine in order to
raise, the latter in order to lower the wages of labour.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_391"><span class="type-margin"><span>The masters have the advantage,</span></span>It
 is not, however, difficult to foresee which of the two parties must,
upon all ordinary occasions, have the advantage in the dispute, and
force the other into a compliance with their terms. The masters, being
fewer in number, can combine much more easily; and the law, besides,
authorises, or at least does not prohibit their combinations,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt272" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt272_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> while it prohibits those of the workmen.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt273" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt273_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 We have no acts of parliament against combining to lower the price of
work; but many against combining to raise it. In all such disputes the
masters can hold out much longer. A landlord, a farmer, a master
manufacturer, or merchant, though they did not employ a single workman,
could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they have
already acquired. Many workmen could not subsist a week, few could
subsist a month, and scarce any a year without employment. In the
long-run the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is
to him; but the necessity is not so immediate.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_392"><span class="type-margin"><span>though less is heard of masters’ combinations than of workmen’s.</span></span>We
 rarely hear, it has been said, of the combinations of masters; though
frequently of those of workmen. But whoever imagines, upon this account,
 that masters rarely combine, is as ignorant of the world as of the
subject. Masters are always and every where in a sort of tacit, but
constant and uniform combination, not to raise the wages of labour above
 their actual rate. To violate this combination is every where a most
unpopular action, and a sort of reproach to a master among his
neighbours and equals. We seldom, indeed, hear of this <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>69<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 combination, because it is the usual, and one may say, the natural
state of things which nobody ever hears of. Masters too sometimes enter
into particular combinations to sink the wages of labour even below this
 rate. These are always conducted with the utmost silence and secrecy,
till the moment of execution, and when the workmen yield, as they
sometimes do, without resistance, though severely felt by them, they are
 never heard of by other people. Such combinations, however, are
frequently resisted by a contrary defensive combination of the workmen;
who sometimes too, without any provocation of this kind, combine of
their own accord to raise the price of their labour. Their usual
pretences<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt274" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt274_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 are, sometimes the high price of provisions; sometimes the great profit
 which their masters make by their work. But whether their combinations
be offensive or defensive, they are always abundantly heard of. In order
 to bring the point to a speedy decision, they have always recourse to
the loudest clamour, and sometimes to the most shocking violence and
outrage. They are desperate, and act with the folly and extravagance of
desperate men, who must either<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt275" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt275_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 starve, or frighten their masters into an immediate compliance with
their demands. The masters upon these occasions are just as clamorous
upon the other side, and never cease to call aloud for the assistance of
 the civil magistrate, and the rigorous execution of those laws which
have been enacted with so much severity against the combinations of
servants, labourers, and journeymen. The workmen, accordingly, very
seldom derive any advantage from the violence of those tumultuous
combinations, which, partly from the interposition of the civil
magistrate, partly from the superior steadiness of the masters, partly
from the necessity which the greater part of the workmen are under of
submitting for the sake of present subsistence, generally end in
nothing, but the punishment or ruin of the ring-leaders.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_393">But though in disputes with their workmen, masters must generally<span class="type-margin"><span>But masters cannot reduce wages below a certain rate,</span></span>
 have the advantage, there is however a certain rate below which it
seems impossible to reduce, for any considerable time, the ordinary
wages even of the lowest species of labour.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_394">A man must always live by his work, and his wages must at least be<span class="type-margin"><span>namely, subsistence for a man and something over for a family</span></span>
 sufficient to maintain him. They must even upon most occasions be
somewhat more; otherwise it would be impossible for him to bring up a
family, and the race of such workmen could not last beyond the first <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>70<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 generation. Mr. Cantillon seems, upon this account, to suppose that the
 lowest species of common labourers must every where earn at least
double their own maintenance, in order that one with another they may be
 enabled to bring up two children; the labour of the wife, on account of
 her necessary attendance on the children, being supposed no more than
sufficient to provide for herself.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt276" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt276_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> But one-half the children born, it is computed, die before the age of manhood.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt277" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt277_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 The poorest labourers, therefore, according to this account, must, one
with another, attempt to rear at least four children, in order that two
may have an equal chance of living to that age. But the necessary
maintenance of four children, it is supposed, may be nearly equal to
that of one man. The labour of an able-bodied slave, the same author
adds, is computed to be worth double his maintenance; and that of the
meanest labourer, he thinks, cannot be worth less than that of an
able-bodied slave. Thus far at least seems certain, that, in order to
bring up a family, the labour of the husband and wife together must,
even in the lowest species of common labour, be able to earn something
more than what is precisely necessary for their own maintenance; but in
what proportion, whether in that above mentioned, or in any other, I
shall not take upon me to determine.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt278" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt278_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_395"><span class="type-margin"><span>Wages may be considerably above this rate,</span></span>There
 are certain circumstances, however, which sometimes give the labourers
an advantage, and enable them to raise their wages considerably above
this rate; evidently the lowest which is consistent with common
humanity.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_396"><span class="type-margin"><span>when there is an increasing demand for labourers,</span></span>When
 in any country the demand for those who live by wages; labourers,
journeymen, servants of every kind, is continually increasing; when
every year furnishes employment for a greater number than had been
employed the year before, the workmen have no occasion to combine in
order to raise their wages. The scarcity of hands occasions a
competition among masters, who bid against one another, in order to get
workmen,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt279" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt279_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> and thus voluntarily break through the natural combination of masters not to raise wages.</p>

 the payment of wages. These funds are of two kinds; first, the revenue
which is over and above what is necessary for the maintenance;<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt280" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt280_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> and, secondly, the stock which is over and above what is necessary for the employment of their masters.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_398">When the landlord, annuitant, or monied man, has a greater revenue<span class="type-margin"><span>surplus revenue,</span></span>
 than what he judges sufficient to maintain his own family, he employs
either the whole or a part of the surplus in maintaining one or more
menial servants.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt281" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt281_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> Increase this surplus, and he will naturally increase the number of those servants.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_399">When an independent workman, such as a weaver or shoe-maker,<span class="type-margin"><span>and surplus stock.</span></span>
 has got more stock than what is sufficient to purchase the materials of

naturally employs one or more journeymen with the surplus, in order to
make a profit by their work. Increase this surplus, and he will
naturally increase the number of his journeymen.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_400">The demand for those who live by wages, therefore, necessarily increases<span class="type-margin"><span>The demand for labourers therefore increases with the increase of national wealth.</span></span>
 with the increase of the revenue and stock of every country, and cannot
 possibly increase without it. The increase of revenue and stock is the
increase of national wealth.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt282" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt282_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 The demand for those who live by wages, therefore, naturally increases
with the increase of national wealth, and cannot possibly increase
without it.</p>

 of labour. It is not, accordingly, in the richest countries, but in the
 most thriving, or in those which are growing rich the fastest, that the
 wages of labour are highest. England is certainly, in the present
times, a much richer<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt284" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt284_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a>
 country than any part of North America. The wages of labour, however,
are much higher in North America than in any part of England. In the
province of New York, common labourers earn<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt285" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt285_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">6</a>
 three shillings and sixpence currency, equal to two shillings sterling,
 a day; ship carpenters, ten shillings and sixpence currency, with a <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>72<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 pint of rum worth sixpence sterling, equal in all to six shillings and
sixpence sterling; house carpenters and bricklayers, eight shillings
currency, equal to four shillings and sixpence sterling; journeymen
taylors, five shillings currency, equal to about two shillings and ten
pence sterling. These prices are all above the London price; and wages
are said to be as high in the other colonies as in New York. The price
of provisions is every where in North America much lower than in
England. A dearth has never been known there. In the worst seasons, they
 have always had a sufficiency for themselves, though less for
exportation. If the money price of labour, therefore, be higher than it
is any where in the mother country, its real price, the real command of
the necessaries and conveniencies of life which it conveys to the
labourer, must be higher in a still greater proportion.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_402"><span class="type-margin"><span>North America is more thriving than England.</span></span>But
 though North America is not yet so rich as England, it is much more
thriving, and advancing with much greater rapidity to the further
acquisition of riches. The most decisive mark of the prosperity of any
country is the increase of the number of its inhabitants. In Great
Britain, and most other European countries, they are not supposed to
double in less than five hundred years. In the British colonies in North
 America, it has been found, that they double in twenty or
five-and-twenty years.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt286" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt286_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Nor in the present times is this increase principally owing to the
continual importation of new inhabitants, but to the great
multiplication of the species. Those who live to old age, it is said,
frequently see there from fifty to a hundred, and sometimes many more,
descendants from their own body. Labour is there so well rewarded that a
 numerous family of children, instead of being a burthen is a source of
opulence and prosperity to the parents. The labour of each child, before
 it can leave their house, is computed to be worth a hundred pounds
clear gain to them. A young widow with four or five young children, who,
 among the middling or inferior ranks of people in Europe, would have so
 little chance for a second husband, is there frequently courted as a
sort of fortune. The value of children is the greatest of all
encouragements to marriage. We cannot, therefore, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>73<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 wonder that the people in North America should generally marry very
young. Notwithstanding the great increase occasioned by such early
marriages, there is a continual complaint of the scarcity of hands in
North America. The demand for labourers, the funds destined for
maintaining them, increase, it seems, still faster than they can find
labourers to employ.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_403">Though the wealth of a country should be very great, yet if it has<span class="type-margin"><span>Wages are not high in a stationary country however rich.</span></span>
 been long stationary, we must not expect to find the wages of labour
very high in it. The funds destined for the payment of wages, the
revenue and stock of its inhabitants, may be of the greatest extent; but
 if they have continued for several centuries of the same, or very
nearly of the same extent, the number of labourers employed every year
could easily supply, and even more than supply, the number wanted the
following year. There could seldom be any scarcity of hands, nor could
the masters be obliged to bid against one another in order to get them.
The hands, on the contrary, would, in this case, naturally multiply
beyond their employment. There would be a constant scarcity of
employment, and the labourers would be obliged to bid against one
another in order to get it. If in such a country the wages of labour had
 ever been more than sufficient to maintain the labourer, and to enable
him to bring up a family, the competition of the labourers and the
interest of the masters would soon reduce them to this lowest rate which
 is consistent with common humanity. China has been long one of the
richest, that is, one of the most fertile, best cultivated, most
industrious, and most populous countries in the world.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt287" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt287_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> It seems, however, to have been long stationary. Marco Polo, who visited it more than five hundred years ago,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt288" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt288_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 describes its cultivation, industry, and populousness, almost in the
same terms in which they are described by travellers in the present
times. It had perhaps, even long before his time, acquired that full
complement of riches which the nature of its laws and institutions
permits it to acquire. The accounts of all travellers, inconsistent in
many other respects, agree in the low wages of labour, and in the
difficulty which a labourer finds in bringing up a family in China. If
by digging the ground a whole day he can get what will purchase a small
quantity of rice in the evening, he is contented. The condition of
artificers is, if possible, still worse. Instead of waiting indolently
in their work-houses, for the calls of their customers, as in Europe,
they are continually running about the streets <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>74<span class="bracket">]</span></span> with the tools of their respective trades, offering their service, and as it were begging employment.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt289" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt289_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The poverty of the lower ranks of people in China far surpasses that of
 the most beggarly nations in Europe. In the neighbourhood of Canton
many hundred, it is commonly said, many thousand families have no
habitation on the land, but live constantly in little fishing boats upon
 the rivers and canals. The subsistence which they find there is so
scanty that they are eager to fish up the nastiest garbage thrown
overboard from any European ship. Any carrion, the carcase of a dead dog
 or cat, for example, though half putrid and stinking, is as welcome to
them as the most wholesome food to the people of other countries.
Marriage is encouraged in China, not by the profitableness of children,
but by the liberty of destroying them. In all great towns several are
every night exposed in the street, or drowned like puppies in the water.
 The performance of this horrid office is even said to be the avowed
business by which some people earn their subsistence.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt290" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt290_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_404"><span class="type-margin"><span>China is not going backwards and labourers there keep up their numbers.</span></span>China,
 however, though it may perhaps stand still, does not seem to go
backwards. Its towns are no-where deserted by their inhabitants. The
lands which had once been cultivated are no-where neglected. The same or
 very nearly the same annual labour must therefore continue to be
performed, and the funds destined for maintaining it must not,
consequently, be sensibly diminished. The lowest class of labourers,
therefore, notwithstanding their scanty subsistence, must some way or
another make shift to continue their race so far as to keep up their
usual numbers.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_405"><span class="type-margin"><span>In a declining country this would not be the case.</span></span>But it would be otherwise in a country where the funds destined for <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>75<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 the maintenance of labour were sensibly decaying. Every year the demand
 for servants and labourers would, in all the different classes of
employments, be less than it had been the year before. Many who had been
 bred in the superior classes, not being able to find employment in
their own business, would be glad to seek it in the lowest. The lowest
class being not only overstocked with its own workmen, but with the
overflowings of all the other classes, the competition for employment
would be so great in it, as to reduce the wages of labour to the most
miserable and scanty subsistence of the labourer. Many would not be able
 to find employment even upon these hard terms, but would either starve,
 or be driven to seek a subsistence either by begging, or by the
perpetration perhaps of the greatest enormities. Want, famine, and
mortality would immediately prevail in that class, and from thence
extend themselves to all the superior classes, till the number of
inhabitants in the country was reduced to what could easily be
maintained by the revenue and stock which remained in it, and which had
escaped either the tyranny or calamity which had destroyed the rest.
This perhaps is nearly the present state of Bengal, and of some other of
 the English settlements in the East Indies. In a fertile country which
had before been much depopulated, where subsistence, consequently,
should not be very difficult, and where, notwithstanding, three or four
hundred thousand people die of hunger in one year, we may be assured
that the funds destined for the maintenance of the labouring poor are
fast decaying. The difference between the genius of the British
constitution which protects and governs North America, and that of the
mercantile company which oppresses and domineers in the East Indies,
cannot perhaps be better illustrated than by the different state of
those countries.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_406">The liberal reward of labour, therefore, as it
 is the necessary effect, so it is the natural symptom of increasing
national wealth. The scanty maintenance of the labouring poor, on the
other hand, is the natural symptom that things are at a stand, and their
 starving condition that they are going fast backwards.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_407">In Great Britain the wages of labour seem, in the present times,<span class="type-margin"><span>In Great Britain wages are above the lowest rate,</span></span>
 to be evidently more than what is precisely necessary to enable the
labourer to bring up a family. In order to satisfy ourselves upon this
point it will not be necessary to enter into any tedious or doubtful
calculation of what may be the lowest sum upon which it is possible to
do this. There are many plain symptoms that the wages of labour are
no-where in this country regulated by this lowest rate which is
consistent with common humanity.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>76<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_408"><span class="type-margin"><span>since (1) there is a difference between winter and summer wages,</span></span>First,
 in almost every part of Great Britain there is a distinction, even in
the lowest species of labour, between summer and winter wages. Summer
wages are always highest. But on account of the extraordinary expence of
 fewel, the maintenance of a family is most expensive in winter. Wages,
therefore, being highest when this expence is lowest, it seems evident
that they are not regulated by what is necessary for this expence; but
by the quantity and supposed value of the work. A labourer, it may be
said indeed, ought to save part of his summer wages in order to defray
his winter expence; and that through the whole year they do not exceed
what is necessary to maintain his family through the whole year. A
slave, however, or one absolutely dependent on us for immediate
subsistence, would not be treated in this manner. His daily subsistence
would be proportioned to his daily necessities.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_409"><span class="type-margin"><span>(2) wages do not fluctuate with the price of provisions,</span></span>Secondly,
 the wages of labour do not in Great Britain fluctuate with the price of
 provisions. These vary every-where from year to year, frequently from
month to month. But in many places the money price of labour remains
uniformly the same sometimes for half a century together. If in these
places, therefore, the labouring poor can maintain their families in
dear years, they must be at their ease in times of moderate plenty, and
in affluence in those of extraordinary cheapness. The high price of
provisions during these ten years past has not in many parts of the
kingdom been accompanied with any sensible rise in the money price of
labour. It has, indeed, in some; owing probably more to the increase of
the demand for labour than to that of the price of provisions.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_410"><span class="type-margin"><span>(3) wages vary more from place to place than the price of provisions,</span></span>Thirdly,
 as the price of provisions varies more from year to year than the wages
 of labour, so, on the other hand, the wages of labour vary more from
place to place than the price of provisions. The prices of bread and
butcher’s meat are generally the same or very nearly the same through
the greater part of the united kingdom. These and most other things
which are sold by retail, the way in which the labouring poor buy all
things, are generally fully as cheap or cheaper in great towns than in
the remoter parts of the country, for reasons which I shall have
occasion to explain hereafter.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt291" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt291_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 But the wages of labour in a great town and its neighbourhood are
frequently a fourth or a fifth part, twenty or five-and-twenty per cent.
 higher than at a few miles distance. Eighteen pence a day may be
reckoned the common price of labour in London and its neighbourhood. At a
 few miles distance it falls to fourteen and fifteen pence. Ten pence
may be reckoned its price in Edinburgh <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>77<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 and its neighbourhood. At a few miles distance it falls to eight pence,
 the usual price of common labour through the greater part of the low
country of Scotland, where it varies a good deal less than in England.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt292" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt292_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Such a difference of prices, which it seems is not always sufficient to
 transport a man from one parish to another, would necessarily occasion
so great a transportation of the most bulky commodities, not only from
one parish to another, but from one end of the kingdom, almost from one
end of the world to the other, as would soon reduce them more nearly to a
 level. After all that has been said of the levity and inconstancy of
human nature, it appears evidently from experience that a man is of all
sorts of luggage the most difficult to be transported. If the labouring
poor, therefore, can maintain their families in those parts of the
kingdom where the price of labour is lowest, they must be in affluence
where it is highest.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_411">Fourthly, the variations in the price of labour not only do not correspond<span class="type-margin"><span>and
 (4) frequently wages and the price of provisions vary in opposite
directions, as grain is cheaper and wages are higher in England than in
Scotland;</span></span> either in place or time with those in the price of provisions, but they are frequently quite opposite.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_412">Grain, the food of the common people, is
dearer in Scotland than in England, whence Scotland receives almost
every year very large supplies. But English corn must be sold dearer in
Scotland, the country to which it is brought, than in England, the
country from which it comes; and in proportion to its quality it cannot
be sold dearer in Scotland than the Scotch corn that comes to the same
market in competition with it. The quality of grain depends chiefly upon
 the quantity of flour or meal which it yields at the mill, and in this
respect English grain is so much superior to the Scotch, that, though
often dearer in appearance, or in proportion to the measure of its bulk,
 it is generally cheaper in reality, or in proportion to its quality, or
 even to the measure of its weight. The price of labour, on the
contrary, is dearer in England than in Scotland. If the labouring poor,
therefore, can maintain their families in the one part of the united
kingdom, they must be in affluence in the other. Oatmeal indeed supplies
 the common people in Scotland with the greatest and the best part of
their food, which is in general much inferior to that of their
neighbours of the same rank in England.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt293" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt293_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 This difference, however, in the mode of their subsistence is not the
cause, but the effect, of the difference in their wages; though, by a
strange misapprehension, I have frequently heard it represented as the
cause. It is <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>78<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 not because one man keeps a coach while his neighbour walks a-foot,
that the one is rich and the other poor; but because the one is rich he

<p id="Smith_0206-01_413"><span class="type-margin"><span>and in last century grain was dearer and wages were lower than in this;</span></span>During
 the course of the last century, taking one year with another, grain was
 dearer in both parts of the united kingdom than during that of the
present. This is a matter of fact which cannot now admit of any
reasonable doubt; and the proof of it is, if possible, still more
decisive with regard to Scotland than with regard to England. It is in
Scotland supported by the evidence of the public fiars, annual
valuations made upon oath, according to the actual state of the markets,
 of all the different sorts of grain in every different county of
Scotland. If such direct proof could require any collateral evidence to
confirm it, I would observe that this has likewise been the case in
France, and probably in most other parts of Europe. With regard to
France there is the clearest proof.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt294" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt294_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 But though it is certain that in both parts of the united kingdom grain
 was somewhat dearer in the last century than in the present, it is
equally certain that labour was much cheaper. If the labouring poor,
therefore, could bring up their families then, they must be much more at
 their ease now. In the last century, the most usual day-wages of common
 labour through the greater part of Scotland were sixpence in summer and
 five-pence in winter. Three shillings a week, the same price very
nearly, still continues to be paid in some parts of the Highlands and
Western Islands. Through the greater part of the low country the most
usual wages of common labour are now eight-pence a day; ten-pence,
sometimes a shilling about Edinburgh, in the counties which border upon
England, probably on account of that neighbourhood, and in a few other
places where there has lately been a considerable rise in the demand for
 labour, about Glasgow, Carron, Ayr-shire, &amp;c. In England the
improvements of agriculture, manufactures and commerce began much
earlier than in Scotland. The demand for labour, and consequently its
price, must necessarily have increased with those improvements. In the
last century, accordingly, as well as in the present, the wages of
labour were higher in England than in Scotland. They have risen too
considerably since that time, though, on account of the greater variety
of wages paid there in different places, it is more difficult to
ascertain how much. In 1614, the pay of a foot soldier was the same as
in the present times, eight pence a day.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt295" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt295_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> When it <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>79<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 was first established it would naturally be regulated by the usual
wages of common labourers, the rank of people from which foot soldiers
are commonly drawn. Lord Chief Justice Hales,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt296" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt296_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 who wrote in the time of Charles II. computes the necessary expence of a
 labourer’s family, consisting of six persons, the father and mother,
two children able to do something, and two not able, at ten shillings a
week, or twenty-six pounds a year. If they cannot earn this by their
labour, they must make it up, he supposes, either by begging or
stealing. He appears to have enquired very carefully into this subject.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt297" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt297_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> In 1688, Mr. Gregory King, whose skill in political arithmetic is so much extolled by Doctor Davenant,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt298" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt298_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 computed the ordinary income of labourers and out-servants to be
fifteen pounds a year to a family, which he supposed to consist, one
with another, of three and a half persons.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt299" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt299_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 His calculation, therefore, though different in appearance, corresponds
 very nearly at bottom with that of judge Hales. Both suppose the weekly
 expence of such families to be about twenty pence a head. Both the
pecuniary income and expence of such families have increased
considerably since that time through the greater part of the kingdom; in
 some places more, and in some less; though perhaps scarce any where so
much as some exaggerated accounts of the present wages of labour have
lately represented them to the public. The price of labour, it must be
observed, cannot be ascertained very accurately any where, different
prices being often paid at the same place and for the same sort of
labour, not only according to the different abilities of the workmen,
but according to the easiness or hardness of the masters. Where wages
are not regulated by law, all that we can pretend to determine is what
are the most usual; and experience seems to show that law can never
regulate them properly, though it has often pretended to do so.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_414">The real recompence of labour, the real quantity of the necessaries<span class="type-margin"><span>while other necessaries and conveniencies have also become cheaper.</span></span>
 and conveniencies of life which it can procure to the labourer, has,
during the course of the present century, increased perhaps in a still
greater proportion than its money price. Not only grain has become
somewhat cheaper, but many other things, from which the industrious poor
 derive an agreeable and wholesome variety of food, have become <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>80<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 a great deal cheaper. Potatoes, for example, do not at present, through
 the greater part of the kingdom, cost half the price which they used to
 do thirty or forty years ago. The same thing may be said of turnips,
carrots, cabbages; things which were formerly never raised but by the
spade, but which are now commonly raised by the plough. All sort of
garden stuff too has become cheaper. The greater part of the apples and
even of the onions consumed in Great Britain were in the last century
imported from Flanders. The great improvements in the coarser
manufactures of both linen and woollen cloth furnish the labourers with
cheaper and better cloathing; and those in the manufactures of the
coarser metals, with cheaper and better instruments of trade, as well as
 with many agreeable and convenient pieces of houshold furniture. Soap,
salt, candles, leather, and fermented liquors, have, indeed, become a
good deal dearer; chiefly from the taxes which have been laid upon them.
 The quantity of these, however, which the labouring poor are under any
necessity of consuming, is so very small, that the increase in their
price does not compensate the diminution in that of so many other
things. The common complaint that luxury extends itself even to the
lowest ranks of the people, and that the labouring poor will not now be
contented with the same food, cloathing and lodging which satisfied them
 in former times, may convince us that it is not the money price of
labour only, but its real recompence, which has augmented.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_415"><span class="type-margin"><span>High earnings of labour are an advantage to the society.</span></span>Is
 this improvement in the circumstances of the lower ranks of the people
to be regarded as an advantage or as an inconveniency to the society?<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt300" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt300_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The answer seems at first sight abundantly plain. Servants, labourers
and workmen of different kinds, make up the far greater part of every
great political society. But what improves the circumstances of the
greater part can never be regarded as an inconveniency to the whole. No
society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater
part of the members are poor and miserable. It is but equity, besides,
that they who feed, cloath and lodge the whole body of the people,
should have such a share of the produce of their own labour as to be
themselves tolerably well fed, cloathed and lodged.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_416"><span class="type-margin"><span>Poverty does not prevent births</span></span>Poverty,
 though it no doubt discourages, does not always prevent marriage. It

 Highland woman frequently bears more than twenty children, while a

exhausted by two or three. Barrenness, so frequent among women of
fashion, is very rare among those of inferior station. Luxury in the
fair sex, while it inflames perhaps the passion for enjoyment, seems
always to weaken, and frequently to destroy altogether, the powers of
generation.</p>

 unfavourable to the rearing of children. The tender plant is produced,
but in so cold a soil, and so severe a climate, soon withers and dies.
It is not uncommon, I have been frequently told, in the Highlands of
Scotland for a mother who has borne twenty children not to have two
alive. Several officers of great experience have assured me, that so far
 from recruiting their regiment, they have never been able to supply it
with drums and fifes from all the soldiers children that were born in
it. A greater number of fine children, however, is seldom seen any where
 than about a barrack of soldiers. Very few of them, it seems, arrive at
 the age of thirteen or fourteen. In some places one half the children
born die before they are four years of age; in many places before they
are seven; and in almost all places before they are nine or ten. This
great mortality, however, will every where be found chiefly among the
children of the common people, who cannot afford to tend them with the
same care as those of better station. Though their marriages are
generally more fruitful than those of people of fashion, a smaller
proportion of their children arrive at maturity. In foundling hospitals,
 and among the children brought up by parish charities, the mortality is
 still greater than among those of the common people.</p>

 But in civilized society it is only among the inferior ranks of people
that the scantiness of subsistence can set limits to the further
multiplication of the human species; and it can do so in no other way
than by destroying a great part of the children which their fruitful
marriages produce.</p>

naturally tends to widen and extend those limits. It deserves to be
remarked too, that it necessarily does this as nearly as possible in the
 proportion which the demand for labour requires.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt301" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt301_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> If this demand is <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>82<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 continually increasing, the reward of labour must necessarily encourage
 in such a manner the marriage and multiplication of labourers, as may
enable them to supply that continually increasing demand by a
continually increasing population. If the reward<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt302" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt302_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 should at any time be less than what was requisite for this purpose,
the deficiency of hands would soon raise it; and if it should at any
time be more, their excessive multiplication would soon lower it to this
 necessary rate. The market would be so much under-stocked with labour
in the one case, and so much over-stocked in the other, as would soon
force back its price to that proper rate which the circumstances of the
society required. It is in this manner that the demand for men, like
that for any other commodity, necessarily regulates the production of
men; quickens it when it goes on too slowly, and stops it when it
advances too fast. It is this demand which regulates and determines the
state of propagation in all the different countries of the world, in
North America, in Europe, and in China; which renders it rapidly
progressive in the first, slow and gradual in the second, and altogether
 stationary in the last.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt303" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt303_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>

 of a slave, it has been said, is at the expence of his master; but that
 of a free servant is at his own expence. The wear and tear of the
latter, however, is, in reality, as much at the expence of his master as
 that of the former. The wages paid to journeymen and servants of every
kind must be such as may enable them, one with another, to continue the
race of journeymen and servants, according as the increasing,
diminishing, or stationary demand of the society may happen to require.
But though the wear and tear of a free servant be equally at the expence
 of his master, it generally costs him much less than that of a slave.
The fund destined for replacing or repairing, if I may say so, the wear
and tear of the slave, is commonly managed by a negligent master or
careless overseer. That destined for performing the same office with
regard to the free man, is managed by the free man himself. The
disorders which generally prevail in the œconomy of the rich, naturally
introduce themselves into the management of the former: The strict
frugality and parsimonious attention of the poor as naturally establish
themselves in that of the latter. Under such different management, the
same <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>83<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 purpose must require very different degrees of expence to execute it.
It appears, accordingly, from the experience of all ages and nations, I
believe, that the work done by freemen comes cheaper in the end than
that performed by slaves. It is found to do so even at Boston, New York,
 and Philadelphia, where the wages of common labour are so very high.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_421">The liberal reward of labour, therefore, as it is the effect of increasing<span class="type-margin"><span>High wages increase population.</span></span>
 wealth, so it is the cause of increasing population. To complain of it,
 is to lament over the necessary effect and cause of the greatest public
 prosperity.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_422">It deserves to be remarked, perhaps, that it is in the progressive<span class="type-margin"><span>The progressive state is the best for the labouring poor</span></span>
 state, while the society is advancing to the further acquisition,
rather than when it has acquired its full complement of riches, that the
 condition of the labouring poor, of the great body of the people, seems
 to be the happiest and the most comfortable. It is hard in the
stationary, and miserable in the declining state. The progressive state
is in reality the cheerful and the hearty state to all the different
orders of the society. The stationary is dull; the declining melancholy.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_423">The liberal reward of labour, as it encourages the propagation, so it<span class="type-margin"><span>High wages encourage industry.</span></span>
 increases the industry of the common people. The wages of labour are
the encouragement of industry, which, like every other human quality,
improves in proportion to the encouragement it receives. A plentiful
subsistence increases the bodily strength of the labourer, and the
comfortable hope of bettering his condition, and of ending his days
perhaps in ease and plenty, animates him to exert that strength to the
utmost. Where wages are high, accordingly, we shall always find the
workmen more active, diligent, and expeditious, than where they are low;
 in England, for example, than in Scotland; in the neighbourhood of
great towns, than in remote country places. Some workmen, indeed, when
they can earn in four days what will maintain them through the week,
will be idle the other three. This, however, is by no means the case
with the greater part.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt305" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt305_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Workmen, on the contrary, when they are liberally paid by the piece,
are very apt to over-work themselves, and to ruin their health and
constitution in a few years. A carpenter in London, and in some other
places, is not supposed to last in his utmost vigour above eight years.
Something of the same kind happens in many other trades, in which the
workmen are paid by the piece; as they generally are in manufactures,
and even in country labour, wherever wages are higher than ordinary.
Almost every class of artificers is subject to some peculiar infirmity
occasioned <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>84<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 by excessive application to their peculiar species of work. Ramuzzini,
an eminent Italian physician, has written a particular book concerning
such diseases.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt306" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt306_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 We do not reckon our soldiers the most industrious set of people among
us. Yet when soldiers have been employed in some particular sorts of
work, and liberally paid by the piece, their officers have frequently
been obliged to stipulate with the undertaker, that they should not be
allowed to earn above a certain sum every day, according to the rate at
which they were paid. Till this stipulation was made, mutual emulation
and the desire of greater gain, frequently prompted them to over-work
themselves, and to hurt their health by excessive labour. Excessive
application during four days of the week, is frequently the real cause
of the idleness of the other three, so much and so loudly complained of.
 Great labour, either of mind or body, continued for several days
together, is in most men naturally followed by a great desire of
relaxation, which, if not restrained by force or by some strong
necessity, is almost irresistible. It is the call of nature, which
requires to be relieved by some indulgence, sometimes of ease only, but
sometimes too of dissipation and diversion. If it is not complied with,
the consequences are often dangerous, and sometimes fatal, and such as
almost always, sooner or later, bring on the peculiar infirmity of the
trade. If masters would always listen to the dictates of reason and
humanity, they have frequently occasion rather to moderate, than to
animate the application of many of their workmen. It will be found, I
believe, in every sort of trade, that the man who works so moderately,
as to be able to work constantly, not only preserves his health the
longest, but, in the course of the year, executes the greatest quantity
of work.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_424"><span class="type-margin"><span>The opinion that cheap years encourage idleness is erroneous.</span></span>In
 cheap years, it is pretended, workmen are generally more idle, and in
dear ones more industrious than ordinary. A plentiful subsistence
therefore, it has been concluded, relaxes, and a scanty one quickens
their industry. That a little more plenty than ordinary may render some
workmen idle, cannot well be doubted; but that it should have this
effect upon the greater part, or that men in general should work better
when they are ill fed than when they are well fed, when they are
disheartened than when they are in good spirits, when they are
frequently sick than when they are generally in good health, seems not
very probable. Years of dearth, it is to be observed, are generally
among the common people years of sickness and mortality, which cannot
fail to diminish the produce of their industry.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>85<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_425">In years of plenty, servants frequently leave their masters, and trust<span class="type-margin"><span>Wages are high in cheap years,</span></span>
 their subsistence to what they can make by their own industry. But the
same cheapness of provisions, by increasing the fund which is destined
for the maintenance of servants, encourages masters, farmers especially,
 to employ a greater number. Farmers upon such occasions expect more
profit from their corn by maintaining a few more labouring servants,
than by selling it at a low price in the market. The demand for servants
 increases, while the number of those who offer to supply that demand
diminishes. The price of labour, therefore, frequently rises in cheap
years.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_426">In years of scarcity, the difficulty and uncertainty of subsistence make<span class="type-margin"><span>and low in dear years,</span></span>
 all such people eager to return to service. But the high price of
provisions, by diminishing the funds destined for the maintenance of
servants, disposes masters rather to diminish than to increase the
number of those they have. In dear years too, poor independent workmen
frequently consume the little stocks with which they had used to supply
themselves with the materials of their work, and are obliged to become
journeymen for subsistence. More people want employment than can easily
get it; many are willing to take it upon lower terms than ordinary, and
the wages of both servants and journeymen frequently sink in dear years.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_427">Masters of all sorts, therefore, frequently make better bargains with<span class="type-margin"><span>so that masters commend dear years.</span></span>
 their servants in dear than in cheap years, and find them more humble
and dependent in the former than in the latter. They naturally,
therefore, commend the former as more favourable to industry. Landlords
and farmers, besides, two of the largest classes of masters, have
another reason for being pleased with dear years. The rents of the one
and the profits of the other depend very much upon the price of
provisions. Nothing can be more absurd, however, than to imagine that
men in general should work less when they work for themselves, than when
 they work for other people. A poor independent workman will generally
be more industrious than even a journeyman who works by the piece. The
one enjoys the whole produce of his own industry; the other shares it
with his master. The one, in his separate independent state, is less
liable to the temptations of bad company, which in large manufactories
so frequently ruin the morals of the other. The superiority of the
independent workman over those servants who are hired by the month or by
 the year, and whose wages and maintenance are the same whether they do
much or do little, is likely to be still greater. Cheap years tend to
increase the proportion of independent workmen to journeymen and
servants of all kinds, and dear years to diminish it.</p>

 in the election of St. Etienne, endeavours to show that the poor do
more work in cheap than in dear years, by comparing the quantity and
value of the goods made upon those different occasions in three
different manufactures; one of coarse woollens carried on at Elbeuf; one
 of linen, and another of silk, both which extend through the whole
generality of Rouen.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt308" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt308_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 It appears from his account, which is copied from the registers of the
public offices, that the quantity and value of the goods made in all
those three manufactures has generally been greater in cheap than in
dear years; and that it has always been greatest in the cheapest, and
least in the dearest years. All the three seem to be stationary
manufactures, or which, though their produce may vary somewhat from year
 to year, are upon the whole neither going backwards nor forwards.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_429"><span class="type-margin"><span>No connexion
is visible between dearness or cheapness of the years and the variations
 in Scotch linen and Yorkshire woollen manufactures</span></span>The
manufacture of linen in Scotland, and that of coarse woollens in the
west riding of Yorkshire, are growing manufactures, of which the produce
 is generally, though with some variations, increasing both in quantity
and value. Upon examining, however, the accounts which have been
published of their annual produce, I have not been able to observe that
its variations have had any sensible connection with the dearness or
cheapness of the seasons. In 1740, a year of great scarcity, both
manufactures, indeed, appear to have declined very considerably. But in
1756, another year of great scarcity, the Scotch manufacture made more
than ordinary advances. The Yorkshire manufacture, indeed, declined, and
 its produce did not rise to what it had been in 1755 till 1766, after
the repeal of the American stamp act. In that and the following year it
greatly exceeded what it had ever been before, and it has continued to
advance<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt309" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt309_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> ever since.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_430"><span class="type-margin"><span>The produce depends on other circumstances, and more of it escapes being reckoned in cheap years</span></span>The
 produce of all great manufactures for distant sale must necessarily
depend, not so much upon the dearness or cheapness of the seasons in the
 countries where they are carried on, as upon the circumstances which
affect the demand in the countries where they are consumed; upon peace
or war, upon the prosperity or declension of other rival manufactures,
and upon the good or bad humour of their principal customers. A great
part of the extraordinary work, besides, which is probably done in cheap
 years, never enters the public registers of manufactures. The men
servants who leave their masters become <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>87<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 independent labourers. The women return to their parents, and commonly
spin in order to make cloaths for themselves and their families. Even
the independent workmen do not always work for public sale, but are
employed by some of their neighbours in manufactures for family use. The
 produce of their labour, therefore, frequently makes no figure in those
 public registers of which the records are sometimes published with so
much parade, and from which our merchants and manufacturers would often
vainly pretend to announce the prosperity or declension of the greatest
empires.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_431">Though the variations in the price of labour, not only do not always<span class="type-margin"><span>There is, however, a connexion between the price of labour and that of provisions.</span></span>
 correspond with those in the price of provisions, but are frequently
quite opposite, we must not, upon this account, imagine that the price
of provisions has no influence upon that of labour. The money price of
labour is necessarily regulated by two circumstances; the demand for
labour, and the price of the necessaries and conveniencies of life. The
demand for labour, according as it happens to be increasing, stationary,
 or declining, or to require an increasing, stationary, or declining
population, determines the quantity of the necessaries and conveniencies
 of life which must be given to the labourer; and the money price of
labour is determined by what is requisite for purchasing this quantity.
Though the money price of labour, therefore, is sometimes high where the
 price of provisions is low, it would be still higher, the demand
continuing the same, if the price of provisions was high.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_432">It is because the demand for labour increases
in years of sudden and extraordinary plenty, and diminishes in those of
sudden and extraordinary scarcity, that the money price of labour
sometimes rises in the one, and sinks in the other.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_433">In a year of sudden and extraordinary plenty, there are funds in the<span class="type-margin"><span>In years of plenty there is a greater demand for labour,</span></span>
 hands of many of the employers of industry, sufficient to maintain and
employ a greater number of industrious people than had been employed the
 year before; and this extraordinary number cannot always be had. Those
masters, therefore, who want more workmen, bid against one another, in
order to get them, which sometimes raises both the real and the money
price of their labour.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_434">The contrary of this happens in a year of sudden and extraordinary<span class="type-margin"><span>and in years of scarcity a less demand,</span></span>
 scarcity. The funds destined for employing industry are less than they
had been the year before. A considerable number of people are thrown out
 of employment, who bid against one another, in order to get it, which
sometimes lowers both the real and the money price of labour. In 1740, a
 year of extraordinary scarcity, many people were <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>88<span class="bracket">]</span></span> willing to work for bare subsistence. In the succeeding years of plenty, it was more difficult to get labourers and servants.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_435"><span class="type-margin"><span>and the effect of variations in the price of provisions is thus counterbalanced.</span></span>The
 scarcity of a dear year, by diminishing the demand for labour, tends to
 lower its price, as the high price of provisions tends to raise it. The
 plenty of a cheap year, on the contrary, by increasing the demand,
tends to raise the price of labour, as the cheapness of provisions tends
 to lower it. In the ordinary variations of the price of provisions,
those two opposite causes seem to counterbalance one another; which is
probably in part the reason why the wages of labour are every-where so
much more steady and permanent than the price of provisions.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_436"><span class="type-margin"><span>Increase of wages increases prices, but the cause of increased wages tends to diminish prices.</span></span>The
 increase in the wages of labour necessarily increases the price of many
 commodities, by increasing that part of it which resolves itself into
wages, and so far tends to diminish their consumption both at home and
abroad. The same cause, however, which raises the wages of labour, the
increase of stock, tends to increase its productive powers, and to make a
 smaller quantity of labour produce a greater quantity of work. The
owner of the stock which employs a great number of labourers,
necessarily endeavours, for his own advantage, to make such a proper
division and distribution of employment, that they may be enabled to
produce the greatest quantity of work possible. For the same reason, he
endeavours to supply them with the best machinery which either he or
they can think of. What takes place among the labourers in a particular
workhouse, takes place, for the same reason, among those of a great
society. The greater their number, the more they naturally divide
themselves into different classes and subdivisions of employment. More
heads are occupied in inventing the most proper machinery for executing
the work of each, and it is, therefore, more likely to be invented.
There are many commodities, therefore, which, in consequence of these
improvements, come to be produced by so much less labour than before,
that the increase of its price is more than compensated by the
diminution of its quantity.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt310" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt310_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>

<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-01_437">THE rise and fall in the profits of stock depend upon the same<span class="type-margin"><span>Profits depend on increase and decrease of wealth,</span></span>
 causes with the rise and fall in the wages of labour, the increasing or
 declining state of the wealth of the society; but those causes affect
the one and the other very differently.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_438">The increase of stock, which raises wages, tends to lower profit.<span class="type-margin"><span>falling with the increase of wealth.</span></span>
 When the stocks of many rich merchants are turned into the same trade,
their mutual competition naturally tends to lower its profit; and when
there is a like increase of stock in all the different trades carried on
 in the same society, the same competition must produce the same effect
in them all.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt311" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt311_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_439">It is not easy, it has already been observed, to ascertain what are the<span class="type-margin"><span>The rate is difficult to ascertain,</span></span>
 average wages of labour even in a particular place, and at a particular
 time. We can, even in this case, seldom determine more than what are
the most usual wages. But even this can seldom be done with regard to
the profits of stock. Profit is so very fluctuating, that the person who
 carries on a particular trade cannot always tell you himself what is
the average of his annual profit. It is affected, not only by every
variation of price in the commodities which he deals in, but by the good
 or bad fortune both of his rivals and of his customers, and by a
thousand other accidents to which goods when carried either by sea or by
 land, or even when stored in a warehouse, are liable. It varies,
therefore, not only from year to year, but from day to day, and almost
from hour to hour. To ascertain what is the average profit of all the
different trades carried on in a great kingdom, must be much more
difficult; and to judge of what it may have been formerly, or in remote
periods of time, with any degree of precision, must be altogether
impossible.</p>

<p id="Smith_0206-01_440"><span class="type-margin"><span>but may be inferred from the rate of interest,</span></span>But
 though it may be impossible to determine with any degree of precision,
what are or were the average profits of stock, either in the present, or
 in ancient times, some notion may be formed of them from the interest
of money.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt312" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt312_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 It may be laid down as a maxim, that wherever a great deal can be made
by the use of money, a great deal will commonly be given for the use of
it; and that wherever little can be made by it, less will commonly be
given for it.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt313" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt313_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 According, therefore, as the usual market rate of interest varies in
any country, we may be assured that the ordinary profits of stock must
vary with it, must sink as it sinks, and rise as it rises. The progress
of interest, therefore, may lead us to form some notion of the progress
of profit.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_441"><span class="type-margin"><span>which has fallen in England,</span></span>By the 37th of Henry VIII.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt314" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt314_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 all interest above ten per cent. was declared unlawful. More, it seems,
 had sometimes been taken before that. In the reign of Edward VI.
religious zeal prohibited all interest.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt315" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt315_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 This prohibition, however, like all others of the same kind, is said to
 have produced no effect, and probably rather increased than diminished
the evil of usury. The statute of Henry VIII. was revived by the 13th of
 Elizabeth, cap. 8.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt316" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt316_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a> and ten per cent. continued to be the legal rate of interest till the 21st of James I.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt317" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt317_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">6</a> when it was restricted to eight per cent. It was reduced to six per cent. soon after the restoration,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt318" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt318_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">7</a> and <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>91<span class="bracket">]</span></span> by the 12th of Queen Anne,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt319" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt319_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 to five per cent. All these different statutory regulations seem to
have been made with great propriety. They seem to have followed and not
to have gone before the market rate of interest, or the rate at which
people of good credit usually borrowed. Since the time of Queen Anne,
five per cent. seems to have been rather above than below the market
rate. Before the late war,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt320" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt320_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> the government borrowed at three per cent.;<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt321" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt321_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 and people of good credit in the capital, and in many other parts of
the kingdom, at three and a half, four, and four and a half per cent.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_442">Since the time of Henry VIII. the wealth and revenue of the country<span class="type-margin"><span>while wealth has been increasing.</span></span>
 have been continually advancing, and, in the course of their progress,
their pace seems rather to have been gradually accelerated than
retarded. They seem, not only to have been going on, but to have been
going on faster and faster.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt322" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt322_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 The wages of labour have been continually increasing during the same
period, and in the greater part of the different branches of trade and
manufactures the profits of stock have been diminishing.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_443">It generally requires a greater stock to carry on any sort of trade in<span class="type-margin"><span>Profits are lower in towns, where there is much stock, than in the country, where there is little.</span></span>
 a great town than in a country village. The great stocks employed in
every branch of trade, and the number of rich competitors, generally
reduce the rate of profit in the former below what it is in the latter.
But the wages of labour are generally higher in a great town than in a
country village. In a thriving town the people who have great stocks to
employ, frequently cannot get the number of workmen they want, and
therefore bid against one another in order to get as many as they can,
which raises the wages of labour, and lowers the profits of stock. In
the remote parts of the country there is frequently not stock sufficient
 to employ all the people, who therefore bid against one another in
order to get employment, which lowers the wages of labour, and raises
the profits of stock.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>92<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_444"><span class="type-margin"><span>Interest is higher in Scotland, a poor country, than in England.</span></span>In
 Scotland, though the legal rate of interest is the same as in England,
the market rate is rather higher. People of the best credit there seldom
 borrow under five per cent. Even private bankers in Edinburgh give four
 per cent. upon their promissory notes, of which payment either in whole
 or in part may be demanded at pleasure. Private bankers in London give
no interest for the money which is deposited with them. There are few
trades which cannot be carried on with a smaller stock in Scotland than
in England. The common rate of profit, therefore, must be somewhat
greater. The wages of labour, it has already been observed, are lower in
 Scotland than in England.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt323" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt323_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The country too is not only much poorer, but the steps by which it
advances to a better condition, for it is evidently advancing, seem to
be much slower and more tardy.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt324" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt324_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_445"><span class="type-margin"><span>So too in France, a country probably less rich than England,</span></span>The
 legal rate of interest in France has not, during the course of the
present century, been always regulated by the market rate.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt325" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt325_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 In 1720 interest was reduced from the twentieth to the fiftieth penny,
or from five to two per cent. In 1724 it was raised to the thirtieth
penny, or to 3⅓ per cent. In 1725 it was again raised to the twentieth
penny, or to five per cent. In 1766, during the administration of Mr.
Laverdy, it was reduced to the twenty-fifth penny, or to four per cent.
The Abbe Terray raised it afterwards to the old rate of five per cent.
The supposed purpose of many of those violent reductions of interest was
 to prepare the way for reducing that of the public debts; a purpose
which has sometimes been executed. France is perhaps in the present
times not so rich a country as England; and though the legal rate of
interest has in France frequently been lower than in England, the market
 rate has generally been higher; for there, as in other countries, they
have several very safe and easy methods of evading the law.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt326" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt326_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 The profits of trade, I have been assured by British merchants who had
traded in both countries, are higher in France than in England; and it
is no doubt upon this account that many British subjects chuse rather to
 employ their capitals in a country where trade is in disgrace, than in
one where it is highly respected. The wages of labour are lower in
France than in England. When you go from Scotland to England, the
difference which you may remark between the dress and countenance of the
 common people in the one country and in the other, sufficiently
indicates the difference in their condition. The contrast is <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>93<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 still greater when you return from France. France, though no doubt a
richer country than Scotland, seems not to be going forward so fast. It
is a common and even a popular opinion in the country, that it is going
backwards; an opinion which, I apprehend, is ill-founded even with
regard to France, but which nobody can possibly entertain with regard to
 Scotland, who sees the country now, and who saw it twenty or thirty
years ago.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_446">The province of Holland, on the other hand, in proportion to the<span class="type-margin"><span>but lower in Holland, which is richer than England.</span></span>
 extent of its territory and the number of its people, is a richer
country than England. The government there borrow at two per cent., and
private people of good credit at three. The wages of labour are said to
be higher in Holland than in England, and the Dutch, it is well known,
trade upon lower profits than any people in Europe. The trade of
Holland, it has been pretended by some people, is decaying, and it may
perhaps be true that some particular branches of it are so. But these
symptoms seem to indicate sufficiently that there is no general decay.
When profit diminishes, merchants are very apt to complain that trade
decays; though the diminution of profit is the natural effect of its
prosperity, or of a greater stock being employed in it than before.
During the late war the Dutch gained the whole carrying trade of France,
 of which they still retain a very large share. The great property which
 they possess both in the French and English funds, about forty
millions, it is said, in the latter (in which I suspect, however, there
is a considerable exaggeration);<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt327" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt327_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 the great sums which they lend to private people in countries where the
 rate of interest is higher than in their own, are circumstances which
no doubt demonstrate the redundancy of their stock, or that it has
increased beyond what they can employ with tolerable profit in the
proper business of their own country: but they do not demonstrate that
that business has decreased. As the capital of a private man, though
acquired by a <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>94<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 particular trade, may increase beyond what he can employ in it, and yet
 that trade continue to increase too; so may likewise the capital of a
great nation.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_447"><span class="type-margin"><span>In the peculiar case of new colonies high wages and high profits go together, but profits gradually diminish.</span></span>In
 our North American and West Indian colonies, not only the wages of
labour, but the interest of money, and consequently the profits of
stock, are higher than in England. In the different colonies both the
legal and the market rate of interest run from six to eight per cent.
High wages of labour and high profits of stock, however, are things,
perhaps, which scarce ever go together, except in the peculiar
circumstances of new colonies. A new colony must always for some time be
 more under-stocked in proportion to the extent of its territory, and
more under-peopled in proportion to the extent of its stock, than the
greater part of other countries. They have more land than they have
stock to cultivate. What they have, therefore, is applied to the
cultivation only of what is most fertile and most favourably situated,
the land<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt328" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt328_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 near the sea shore, and along the banks of navigable rivers. Such land
too is frequently purchased at a price below the value even of its
natural produce. Stock employed in the purchase and improvement of such
lands must yield a very large profit, and consequently afford to pay a
very large interest. Its rapid accumulation in so profitable an
employment enables the planter to increase the number of his hands
faster than he can find them in a new settlement. Those whom he can
find, therefore, are very liberally rewarded. As the colony increases,
the profits of stock gradually diminish. When the most fertile and best
situated lands have been all occupied, less profit can be made by the
cultivation of what is inferior both in soil and situation, and less
interest can be afforded for the stock which is so employed. In the
greater part of our colonies, accordingly, both the legal and the market
 rate of interest have been considerably reduced during the course of
the present century. As riches, improvement, and population have
increased, interest has declined. The wages of labour do not sink with
the profits of stock. The demand for labour increases with the increase
of stock whatever be its profits; and after these are diminished, stock
may not only continue to increase, but to increase much faster than
before. It is with industrious nations who are advancing in the
acquisition of riches, as with industrious individuals. A great stock,
though with small profits, generally increases faster than a small stock
 with great profits. Money, says the proverb, makes money. When you have
 got a little, it is often easy to get more. The great difficulty is to
get that little. The connection <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>95<span class="bracket">]</span></span> between the increase of stock and that of industry, or of the demand for useful labour, has partly been explained already,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt329" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt329_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> but will be explained more fully hereafter<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt330" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt330_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> in treating of the accumulation of stock.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_448">The acquisition of new territory, or of new branches of trade, may<span class="type-margin"><span>New territories and trades may raise profits even in a country advancing in riches.</span></span>
 sometimes raise the profits of stock, and with them the interest of
money, even in a country which is fast advancing in the acquisition of
riches. The stock of the country not being sufficient for the whole
accession of business, which such acquisitions present to the different
people among whom it is divided, is applied to those particular branches
 only which afford the greatest profit. Part of what had before been
employed in other trades, is necessarily withdrawn from them, and turned
 into some of the new and more profitable ones. In all those old trades,
 therefore, the competition comes to be less than before. The market
comes to be less fully supplied with many different sorts of goods.
Their price necessarily rises more or less, and yields a greater profit
to those who deal in them, who can, therefore, afford to borrow at a
higher interest. For some time after the conclusion of the late war, not
 only private people of the best credit, but some of the greatest
companies in London, commonly borrowed at five per cent. who before that
 had not been used to pay more than four, and four and a half per cent.
The great accession both of territory and trade, by our acquisitions in
North America and the West Indies, will sufficiently account for this,
without supposing any diminution in the capital stock of the society. So
 great an accession of new business to be carried on by the old stock,
must necessarily have diminished the quantity employed in a great number
 of particular branches, in which the competition being less, the
profits must have been greater. I shall hereafter<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt331" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt331_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 have occasion to mention the reasons which dispose me to believe that
the capital stock of Great Britain was not diminished even by the
enormous expence of the late war.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_449">The diminution of the capital stock of the society, or of the funds<span class="type-margin"><span>Diminution of capital stock raises profits.</span></span>
 destined for the maintenance of industry, however, as it lowers the
wages of labour, so it raises the profits of stock, and consequently the
 interest of money. By the wages of labour being lowered, the owners of
what stock remains in the society can bring their goods at less expence
to market than before, and less stock being employed in supplying the
market than before, they can sell them dearer.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt332" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt332_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> Their goods cost them less, and they get more for them. Their profits, therefore, being <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>96<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 augmented at both ends, can well afford a large interest. The great
fortunes so suddenly and so easily acquired in Bengal and the other
British settlements in the East Indies, may satisfy us that, as the
wages of labour are very low, so the profits of stock are very high in
those ruined countries. The interest of money is proportionably so. In
Bengal, money is frequently lent to the farmers at forty, fifty, and
sixty per cent. and the succeeding crop is mortgaged for the payment. As
 the profits which can afford such an interest must eat up almost the
whole rent of the landlord, so such enormous usury must in its turn eat
up the greater part of those profits. Before the fall of the Roman
republic, a usury of the same kind seems to have been common in the
provinces, under the ruinous administration of their proconsuls. The
virtuous Brutus lent money in Cyprus at eight-and-forty<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt333" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt333_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> per cent. as we learn from the letters of Cicero.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt334" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt334_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_450"><span class="type-margin"><span>In a country as rich as it possibly could be, profits as well as wages would be very low,</span></span>In
 a country which had acquired that full complement of riches which the
nature of its soil and climate, and its situation with respect to other
countries, allowed it to acquire; which could, therefore, advance no
further, and which was not going backwards, both the wages of labour and
 the profits of stock would probably be very low. In a country fully
peopled in proportion to what either its territory could maintain or its
 stock employ, the competition for employment would necessarily be so
great as to reduce the wages of labour to what was barely sufficient to
keep up the number of labourers, and, the country being already fully
peopled, that number could never be augmented. In a country fully
stocked in proportion to all the business it had to transact, as great a
 quantity of stock would be employed in every particular branch as the
nature and extent of the trade would admit. The competition, therefore,
would every-where be as great, and consequently the ordinary profit as
low as possible.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_451"><span class="type-margin"><span>but there has never yet been any such country.</span></span>But
 perhaps no country has ever yet arrived at this degree of opulence.
China seems to have been long stationary, and had probably long ago
acquired that full complement of riches which is consistent with the
nature of its laws and institutions. But this complement may be much
inferior to what, with other laws and institutions, the nature of its
soil, climate, and situation might admit of. A country which neglects or
 despises foreign commerce, and which admits the vessels of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>97<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 foreign nations into one or two of its ports only, cannot transact the
same quantity of business which it might do with different laws and
institutions. In a country too, where, though the rich or the owners of
large capitals enjoy a good deal of security, the poor or the owners of
small capitals enjoy scarce any, but are liable, under the pretence of
justice, to be pillaged and plundered at any time by the inferior
mandarines, the quantity of stock employed in all the different branches
 of business transacted within it, can never be equal to what the nature
 and extent of that business might admit. In every different branch, the
 oppression of the poor must establish the monopoly of the rich, who, by
 engrossing the whole trade to themselves, will be able to make very
large profits. Twelve per cent. accordingly is said to be the common
interest of money in China, and the ordinary profits of stock must be
sufficient to afford this large interest.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_452">A defect in the law may sometimes raise the rate of interest considerably<span class="type-margin"><span>Interest is raised by defective enforcement of contracts,</span></span>
 above what the condition of the country, as to wealth or poverty, would
 require. When the law does not enforce the performance of contracts, it
 puts all borrowers nearly upon the same footing with bankrupts or
people of doubtful credit in better regulated countries. The uncertainty
 of recovering his money makes the lender exact the same usurious
interest which is usually required from bankrupts. Among the barbarous
nations who over-run the western provinces of the Roman empire, the
performance of contracts was left for many ages to the faith of the
contracting parties.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt335" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt335_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The courts of justice of their kings seldom intermeddled in it. The
high rate of interest which took place in those ancient times may
perhaps be partly accounted for from this cause.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_453">When the law prohibits interest altogether, it does not prevent it.<span class="type-margin"><span>and by prohibition.</span></span>
 Many people must borrow, and nobody will lend without such a
consideration for the use of their money as is suitable, not only to
what can be made by the use of it, but to the difficulty and danger of
evading the law. The high rate of interest among all Mahometan nations
is accounted for by Mr. Montesquieu, not from their poverty, but partly
from this,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt336" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt336_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> and partly from the difficulty of recovering the money.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt337" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt337_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>

 every employment of stock is exposed. It is this surplus only which is
neat or clear profit. What is called gross profit comprehends
frequently, not only this surplus, but what is retained for compensating
 such extraordinary losses. The interest which the borrower can afford

 a country which had acquired its full complement of riches, where in
every particular branch of business there was the greatest quantity of
stock that could be employed in it, as the ordinary rate of clear profit
 would be very small, so the usual market rate of interest which could
be afforded out of it, would be so low as to render it impossible for
any but the very wealthiest people to live upon the interest of their
money. All people of small or middling fortunes would be obliged to
superintend themselves the employment of their own stocks. It would be
necessary that almost every man should be a man of business, or engage
in some sort of trade. The province of Holland seems to be approaching
near to this state. It is there unfashionable not to be a man of
business.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt338" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt338_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Necessity makes it usual for almost every man to be so, and custom
every where regulates fashion. As it is ridiculous not to dress, so is
it, in some measure, not to be employed, like other people. As a man of a
 civil profession seems awkward in a camp or a garrison, and is even in
some danger of being despised there, so does an idle man among men of
business.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_457"><span class="type-margin"><span>The highest rate of profit would eat up all rent and leave only wages.</span></span>The
 highest ordinary rate of profit may be such as, in the price of the
greater part of commodities, eats up the whole of what should go to the
rent of the land, and leaves only what is sufficient to pay the labour
of preparing and bringing them to market, according to the lowest rate
at which labour can any-where be paid, the bare subsistence of the
labourer. The workman must always have been fed in some way or other
while he was about the work; but the landlord may not always have been
paid. The profits of the trade which the servants of the East India
Company carry on in Bengal may not perhaps be very far from this rate.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt339" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt339_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_458"><span class="type-margin"><span>The proportion of interest to profit</span></span>The
 proportion which the usual market rate of interest ought to bear to the
 ordinary rate of clear profit, necessarily varies as profit <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>99<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 rises or falls. Double interest is in Great Britain reckoned, what the
merchants call, a good, moderate, reasonable profit; terms which I
apprehend mean no more than a common and usual profit.<span class="type-margin"><span>rises and falls with the rate of profit.</span></span>
 In a country where the ordinary rate of clear profit is eight or ten
per cent., it may be reasonable that one half of it should go to
interest, wherever business is carried on with borrowed money. The stock
 is at the risk of the borrower, who, as it were, insures it to the
lender; and four or five per cent. may, in the greater part of trades,
be both a sufficient profit upon the risk of this insurance, and a
sufficient recompence for the trouble of employing the stock. But the
proportion between interest and clear profit might not be the same in
countries where the ordinary rate of profit was either a good deal
lower, or a good deal higher. If it were a good deal lower, one half of
it perhaps could not be afforded for interest; and more might be
afforded if it were a good deal higher.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_459">In countries which are fast advancing to riches, the low rate of profit<span class="type-margin"><span>Countries
 with low profits can sell as cheap as those with low wages; and in
reality high profits tend to raise prices more than high wages.</span></span>
 may, in the price of many commodities, compensate the high wages of
labour, and enable those countries to sell as cheap as their less
thriving neighbours, among whom the wages of labour may be lower.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_460">In reality high profits tend much more to
raise the price of work than high wages. If in the linen manufacture,
for example, the wages of the different working people, the
flax-dressers, the spinners, the weavers, &amp;c. should, all of them,
be advanced two pence a day; it would be necessary to heighten the price
 of a piece of linen only by a number of two pences equal to the number
of people that had been employed about it, multiplied by the number of
days during which they had been so employed. That part of the price of
the commodity which resolved itself into wages would, through all the
different stages of the manufacture, rise only in arithmetical
proportion to this rise of wages. But if the profits of all the
different employers of those working people should be raised five per
cent. that part of the price of the commodity which resolved itself into
 profit, would, through all the different stages of the manufacture,
rise in geometrical proportion to this rise of profit. The employer of
the flax-dressers would in selling his flax require an additional five
per cent. upon the whole value of the materials and wages which he
advanced to his workmen. The employer of the spinners would require an
additional five per cent. both upon the advanced price of the flax and
upon the wages of the spinners. And the employer of the weavers would
require a like five per cent. both upon the advanced price of the linen
yarn and upon the wages of the weavers. In raising the price of
commodities the rise of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>100<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 wages operates in the same manner as simple interest does in the
accumulation of debt. The rise of profit operates like compound
interest.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt340" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt340_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Our merchants and master-manufacturers complain much of the bad effects
 of high wages in raising the price, and thereby lessening the sale of
their goods both at home and abroad. They say nothing concerning the bad
 effects of high profits. They are silent with regard to the pernicious
effects of their own gains. They complain only of those of other people.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt341" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt341_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>

in the employments themselves, which, either really, or at least in the
imaginations of men, make up for a small pecuniary gain in some, and
counter-balance a great one in others; and partly from the policy of
Europe, which no-where leaves things at perfect liberty.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_463">The particular consideration of those circumstances and of that policy will divide this chapter into two parts.</p>

<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-01_464"><span class="type-margin"><span>There are five counter-balancing circumstances:</span></span>THE
 five following are the principal circumstances which, so far as I have
been able to observe, make up for a small pecuniary gain in some
employments, and counter-balance a great one in others: first, the
agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves;
secondly, the easiness and cheapness, or the difficulty and expence of
learning them; thirdly, the constancy or inconstancy of employment in
them; fourthly, the small or great trust which must be reposed in those
who exercise them; and fifthly, the probability or improbability of
success in them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_465"><span class="type-margin"><span>(1) Wages vary with the agreeableness of the employment.</span></span>First,
 The wages of labour vary with the ease or hardship, the cleanliness or
dirtiness, the honourableness or dishonourableness of the employment.
Thus in most places, take the year round, a journeyman taylor earns less
 than a journeyman weaver. His work is much easier. A journeyman weaver
earns less than a journeyman smith. His work is not always easier, but
it is much cleanlier. A journeyman blacksmith, though an artificer,
seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier, who is only a
labourer, does in eight. His work is not quite so dirty, is less
dangerous, and is carried on in day-light, and above ground. Honour
makes a great part of the reward of all honourable professions. In point
 of pecuniary gain, all things considered, they are generally
under-recompensed, as I shall endeavour to show by and by.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt346" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt346_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 Disgrace has the contrary effect. The trade of a butcher is a brutal
and an odious business; but it is in most places more profitable than
the greater part of common trades. The most detestable of all
employments, that of public executioner, is, in proportion to the
quantity of work done, better paid than any common trade whatever.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_466"><span class="type-margin"><span>Some very agreeable employments are exceedingly ill paid.</span></span>Hunting
 and fishing, the most important employments of mankind in the rude
state of society, become in its advanced state their most agreeable
amusements, and they pursue for pleasure what they once followed from
necessity. In the advanced state of society, therefore, they are all
very poor people who follow as a trade, what other people <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>103<span class="bracket">]</span></span> pursue as a pastime. Fishermen have been so since the time of<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt347" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt347_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Theocritus. A poacher is every-where a very poor man in Great Britain.
In countries where the rigour of the law suffers no poachers, the
licensed hunter is not in a much better condition. The natural taste for
 those employments makes more people follow them than can live
comfortably by them, and the produce of their labour, in proportion to
its quantity, comes always too cheap to market to afford anything but
the most scanty subsistence to the labourers.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_467">Disagreeableness and disgrace affect the profits of stock in the same<span class="type-margin"><span>The same thing is true of profits.</span></span>
 manner as the wages of labour. The keeper of an inn or tavern, who is
never master of his own house, and who is exposed to the brutality of
every drunkard, exercises neither a very agreeable nor a very creditable
 business. But there is scarce any common trade in which a small stock
yields so great a profit.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_468">Secondly, The wages of labour vary with the easiness and cheapness,<span class="type-margin"><span>(2) Wages vary with the cost of learning the business.</span></span> or the difficulty and expence of learning the business.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_469">When any expensive machine is erected, the
extraordinary work to be performed by it before it is worn out, it must
be expected, will replace the capital laid out upon it, with at least
the<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt348" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt348_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 ordinary profits. A man educated at the expence of much labour and time
 to any of those employments which require extraordinary dexterity and
skill, may be compared to one of those expensive machines. The work
which he learns to perform, it must be expected, over and above the
usual wages of common labour, will replace to him the whole expence of
his education, with at least the ordinary profits of an equally valuable
 capital. It must do this too in a reasonable time, regard being had to
the very uncertain duration of human life, in the same manner as to the
more certain duration of the machine.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_470">The difference between the wages of skilled labour and those of common labour, is founded upon this principle.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_471">The policy of Europe considers the labour of all mechanics, artificers,<span class="type-margin"><span>The cost of apprenticeship accounts for the wages of manufacturers being higher than those of country labourers</span></span>
 and manufacturers, as skilled labour; and that of all country labourers
 as common labour. It seems to suppose that of the former to be of a
more nice and delicate nature than that of the latter. It is so perhaps
in some cases; but in the greater part it is quite otherwise, as I shall
 endeavour to shew by and by.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt349" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt349_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 The laws and customs of Europe, therefore, in order to qualify any
person for exercising the one species of labour, impose the necessity of
 an apprenticeship, though with different degrees of rigour in different
 places. They leave the other free and <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>104<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 open to every body. During the continuance of the apprenticeship, the
whole labour of the apprentice belongs to his master. In the mean time
he must, in many cases, be maintained by his parents or relations, and
in almost all cases must be cloathed by them. Some money too is commonly
 given to the master for teaching him his trade. They who cannot give
money, give time, or become bound for more than the usual number of
years; a consideration which, though it is not always advantageous to
the master, on account of the usual idleness of apprentices, is always
disadvantageous to the apprentice. In country labour, on the contrary,
the labourer, while he is employed about the easier, learns the more
difficult parts of his business, and his own labour maintains him
through all the different stages of his employment. It is reasonable,
therefore, that in Europe the wages of mechanics, artificers, and
manufacturers, should be somewhat higher than those of common labourers.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt350" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt350_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 They are so accordingly, and their superior gains make them in most
places be considered as a superior rank of people. This superiority,
however, is generally very small; the daily or weekly earnings of
journeymen in the more common sorts of manufactures, such as those of
plain linen and woollen cloth, computed at an average, are, in most
places, very little more than the day wages of common labourers. Their
employment, indeed, is more steady and uniform, and the superiority of
their earnings, taking the whole year together, may be somewhat greater.
 It seems evidently, however, to be no greater than what is sufficient
to compensate the superior expence of their education.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_472"><span class="type-margin"><span>Education for
liberal professions is more costly and the pecuniary recompense
consequently higher. Profits are not much affected by this circumstance.</span></span>Education
 in the ingenious arts and in the liberal professions, is still more
tedious and expensive. The pecuniary recompence, therefore, of painters
and sculptors, of lawyers and physicians, ought<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt351" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt351_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> to be much more liberal: and it is so accordingly.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_473">The profits of stock seem to be very little
affected by the easiness or difficulty of learning the trade in which it
 is employed. All the different ways in which stock is commonly employed
 in great towns seem, in reality, to be almost equally easy and equally
difficult to learn. One branch either of foreign or domestic trade,
cannot well be a much more intricate business than another.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>105<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_474">Thirdly, The wages of labour in different occupations vary with the<span class="type-margin"><span>(3) Wages vary with constancy of employment.</span></span> constancy or inconstancy of employment.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt352" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt352_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_475">Employment is much more constant in some
trades than in others. In the greater part of manufactures, a journeyman
 may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he
is able to work. A mason or bricklayer, on the contrary, can work
neither in hard frost nor in foul weather, and his employment at all
other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers. He is
liable, in consequence, to be frequently without any. What he earns,
therefore, while he is employed, must not only maintain him while he is
idle, but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding
moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes
occasion. Where the computed earnings of the greater part of
manufacturers, accordingly, are nearly upon a level with the day wages
of common labourers, those of masons and bricklayers are generally from
one half more to double those wages. Where common labourers earn four
and five shillings a week, masons and bricklayers frequently earn seven
and eight; where the former earn six, the latter often earn nine and
ten, and where the former earn nine and ten, as in London, the latter
commonly earn fifteen and eighteen. No species of skilled labour,
however, seems more easy to learn than that of masons and bricklayers.
Chairmen in London, during the summer season, are said sometimes to be
employed as bricklayers. The high wages of those workmen, therefore, are
 not so much the recompence of their skill, as the compensation for the
inconstancy of their employment.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_476">A house carpenter seems to exercise rather a
nicer and more ingenious trade than a mason. In most places, however,
for it is not universally so, his day-wages are somewhat lower. His
employment, though it depends much, does not depend so entirely upon the
 occasional calls of his customers; and it is not liable to be
interrupted by the weather.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_477">When the trades which generally afford
constant employment, happen in a particular place not to do so, the
wages of the workmen always rise a good deal above their ordinary
proportion to those of common labour. In London almost all journeymen
artificers are liable to be called upon and dismissed by their masters
from day to <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>106<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 day, and from week to week, in the same manner as day-labourers in
other places. The lowest order of artificers, journeymen taylors,
accordingly, earn there half a crown a day,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt353" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt353_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 though eighteen pence may be reckoned the wages of common labour. In
small towns and country villages, the wages of journeymen taylors
frequently scarce equal those of common labour; but in London they are
often many weeks without employment, particularly during the summer.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_478">When the inconstancy of employment is combined
 with the hardship, disagreeableness, and dirtiness of the work, it
sometimes raises the wages of the most common labour above those of the
most skilful artificers. A collier working by the piece is supposed, at
Newcastle, to earn commonly about double, and in many parts of Scotland
about three times the wages of common labour. His high wages arise
altogether from the hardship, disagreeableness, and dirtiness of his
work. His employment may, upon most occasions, be as constant as he
pleases. The coal-heavers in London exercise a trade which in hardship,
dirtiness, and disagreeableness, almost equals that of colliers; and
from the unavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coal-ships, the
employment of the greater part of them is necessarily very inconstant.
If colliers, therefore, commonly earn double and triple the wages of
common labour, it ought not to seem unreasonable that coal-heavers
should sometimes earn four and five times those wages. In the enquiry
made into their condition a few years ago, it was found that at the rate
 at which they were then paid, they could earn from six to ten shillings
 a day. Six shillings are about four times the wages of common labour in
 London, and in every particular trade, the lowest common earnings may
always be considered as those of the far greater number. How extravagant
 soever those earnings may appear, if they were more than sufficient to
compensate all the disagreeable circumstances of the business, there
would soon be so great a number of competitors as, in a trade which has
no exclusive privilege, would quickly reduce them to a lower rate.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_479"><span class="type-margin"><span>Constancy does not affect profits.</span></span>The constancy or inconstancy of employment cannot affect<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt354" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt354_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 the ordinary profits of stock in any particular trade. Whether the
stock is or is not constantly employed depends, not upon the trade, but
the trader.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt355" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt355_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>107<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_480">Fourthly, The wages of labour vary according to the small or great<span class="type-margin"><span>(4) Wages vary with the trust to be reposed.</span></span> trust which must be reposed in the workmen.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt356" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt356_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_481">The wages of goldsmiths and jewellers are
every-where superior to those of many other workmen, not only of equal,
but of much superior ingenuity; on account of the precious materials
with which they are intrusted.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_482">We trust our health to the physician; our
fortune and sometimes our life and reputation to the lawyer and
attorney. Such confidence could not safely be reposed in people of a
very mean or low condition. Their reward must be such, therefore, as may
 give them that rank in the society which so important a trust requires.
 The long time and the great expence which must be laid out in their
education, when combined with this circumstance, necessarily enhance
still further the price of their labour.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_483">When a person employs only his own stock in trade, there is no<span class="type-margin"><span>Profits are unaffected by trust</span></span>
 trust; and the credit which he may get from other people, depends, not
upon the nature of his trade, but upon their opinion of his fortune,
probity, and prudence. The different rates of profit, therefore, in the
different branches of trade, cannot arise from the different degrees of
trust reposed in the traders.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt357" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt357_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_484">Fifthly, The wages of labour in different employments vary according<span class="type-margin"><span>(5) Wages vary with the probability of success.</span></span> to the probability or improbability of success in them.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt358" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt358_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_485">The probability that any particular person
shall ever be qualified for the employment to which he is educated, is
very different in different occupations. In the greater part of mechanic
 trades, success is almost certain; but very uncertain in the liberal
professions. Put your son apprentice to a shoemaker, there is little
doubt of his learning to make a pair of shoes: But send him to study the
 law, it is at least twenty to <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>108<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 one if ever he makes such proficiency as will enable him to live by the
 business. In a perfectly fair lottery, those who draw the prizes ought
to gain all that is lost by those who draw the blanks. In a profession
where twenty fail for one that succeeds, that one ought to gain all that
 should have been gained by the unsuccessful twenty. The counsellor at
law who, perhaps, at near forty years of age, begins to make something
by his profession, ought to receive the retribution, not only of his own
 so tedious and expensive education, but of that of more than twenty
others who are never likely to make any thing by it. How extravagant
soever the fees of counsellors at law may sometimes appear, their real
retribution is never equal to this.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt359" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt359_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Compute in any particular place, what is likely to be annually gained,
and what is likely to be annually spent, by all the different workmen in
 any common trade, such as that of shoemakers or weavers, and you will
find that the former sum will generally exceed the latter. But make the
same computation with regard to all the counsellors and students of law,
 in all the different inns of court, and you will find that their annual
 gains bear but a very small proportion to their annual expence, even
though you rate the former as high, and the latter as low, as can well
be done. The lottery of the law, therefore, is very far from being a
perfectly fair lottery; and that, as well as many other liberal and
honourable professions, is,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt360" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt360_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> in point of pecuniary gain, evidently under-recompenced.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_486"><span class="type-margin"><span>Law and similar professions are nevertheless crowded.</span></span>Those
 professions keep their level, however, with other occupations, and,
notwithstanding these discouragements, all the most generous and liberal
 spirits are eager to crowd into them. Two different causes contribute
to recommend them. First, the desire of the reputation which attends
upon superior excellence in any of them; and, secondly, the natural
confidence which every man has more or less, not only in his own
abilities, but in his own good fortune.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_487"><span class="type-margin"><span>Public admiration makes a part of the reward of superior abilities,</span></span>To
 excel in any profession, in which but few arrive at mediocrity, is the

 of public prostitution. The pecuniary recompence, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>109<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 therefore, of those who exercise them in this manner, must be
sufficient, not only to pay for the time, labour, and expence of
acquiring the talents, but for the discredit which attends the
employment of them as the means of subsistence. The exorbitant rewards
of players, opera-singers, opera-dancers, &amp;c. are founded upon those
 two principles; the rarity and beauty of the talents, and the discredit
 of employing them in this manner. It seems absurd at first sight that
we should despise their persons, and yet reward their talents with the
most profuse liberality. While we do the one, however, we must of
necessity do the other. Should the public opinion or prejudice ever
alter with regard to such occupations, their pecuniary recompence would
quickly diminish. More people would apply to them, and the competition
would quickly reduce the price of their labour. Such talents, though far
 from being common, are by no means so rare as is imagined. Many people
possess them in great perfection, who disdain to make this use of them;
and many more are capable of acquiring them, if any thing could be made
honourably by them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_489">The over-weening conceit which the greater part of men have of their<span class="type-margin"><span>The greater part of men have an over-weening conceit of their abilities:</span></span>
 own abilities, is an ancient evil remarked by the philosophers and
moralists of all ages. Their absurd presumption in their own good
fortune, has been less taken notice of. It is, however, if possible,
still more universal. There is no man living who, when in tolerable
health and spirits, has not some share of it. The chance of gain is by
every man more or less over-valued, and the chance of loss is by most
men under-valued, and by scarce any man, who is in tolerable health and
spirits, valued more than it is worth.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_490">That the chance of gain is naturally over-valued, we may learn from<span class="type-margin"><span>lotteries show that the chance of gain is over-valued,</span></span>
 the universal success of lotteries. The world neither ever saw, nor
ever will see, a perfectly fair lottery; or one in which the whole gain
compensated the whole loss; because the undertaker could make nothing by
 it. In the state lotteries the tickets are really not worth the price
which is paid by the original subscribers, and yet commonly sell in the
market for twenty, thirty, and sometimes forty per cent. advance. The
vain hope of gaining some of the great prizes is the sole cause of this
demand. The soberest people scarce look upon it as a folly to pay a
small sum for the chance of gaining ten or twenty thousand pounds;
though they know that even that small sum is perhaps twenty or thirty
per cent. more than the chance is worth. In a lottery in which no prize
exceeded twenty pounds, though in other respects it approached much
nearer to a perfectly fair one than the common state lotteries, there
would not be the same demand for <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>110<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 tickets. In order to have a better chance for some of the great prizes,
 some people purchase several tickets, and others, small shares in a
still greater number. There is not, however, a more certain proposition
in mathematics, than that the more tickets you adventure upon, the more
likely you are to be a loser. Adventure upon all the tickets in the
lottery, and you lose for certain; and the greater the number of your
tickets the nearer you approach to this certainty.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_491"><span class="type-margin"><span>and the moderate profit of insurers shows that the chance of loss is undervalued.</span></span>That
 the chance of loss is frequently undervalued, and scarce ever valued
more than it is worth, we may learn from the very moderate profit of
insurers. In order to make insurance, either from fire or sea-risk, a
trade at all, the common premium must be sufficient to compensate the
common losses, to pay the expence of management, and to afford such a
profit as might have been drawn from an equal capital employed in any
common trade. The person who pays no more than this, evidently pays no
more than the real value of the risk, or the lowest price at which he
can reasonably expect to insure it. But though many people have made a
little money by insurance, very few have made a great fortune; and from
this consideration alone, it seems evident enough, that the ordinary
balance of profit and loss is not more advantageous in this, than in
other common trades by which so many people make fortunes. Moderate,
however, as the premium of insurance commonly is, many people despise
the risk too much to care to pay it. Taking the whole kingdom at an
average, nineteen houses in twenty, or rather, perhaps, ninety-nine in a
 hundred, are not insured from fire. Sea risk is more alarming to the
greater part of people, and the proportion of ships insured to those not
 insured is much greater. Many sail, however, at all seasons, and even
in time of war, without any insurance. This may sometimes perhaps be
done without any imprudence. When a great company, or even a great
merchant, has twenty or thirty ships at sea, they may, as it were,
insure one another. The premium saved upon them all, may more than
compensate such losses as they are likely to meet with in the common
course of chances. The neglect of insurance upon shipping, however, in
the same manner as upon houses, is, in most cases, the effect of no such
 nice calculation, but of mere thoughtless rashness and presumptuous
contempt of the risk.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_492"><span class="type-margin"><span>Young people are particularly prone to over-value the chance of gain and under-value the risk of loss.</span></span>The
 contempt of risk and the presumptuous hope of success, are in no period
 of life more active than at the age at which young people chuse their
professions. How little the fear of misfortune is then capable of
balancing the hope of good luck, appears still more evidently in the
readiness of the common people to enlist as soldiers, or <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>111<span class="bracket">]</span></span> to go to sea, than in the eagerness of those of better fashion to enter into what are called the liberal professions.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_493"><span class="type-margin"><span>For this reason soldiers are poorly paid,</span></span>What
 a common soldier may lose is obvious enough. Without regarding the
danger, however, young volunteers never enlist so readily as at the
beginning of a new war; and though they have scarce any chance of
preferment, they figure to themselves, in their youthful fancies, a
thousand occasions of acquiring honour and distinction which never
occur. These romantic hopes make the whole price of their blood. Their
pay is less than that of common labourers, and in actual service their
fatigues are much greater.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_494">The lottery of the sea is not altogether so disadvantageous as that<span class="type-margin"><span>and sailors not much better.</span></span>
 of the army. The son of a creditable labourer or artificer may
frequently go to sea with his father’s consent; but if he enlists as a
soldier, it is always without it. Other people see some chance of his
making something by the one trade: nobody but himself sees any of his
making any thing by the other. The great admiral is less the object of
public admiration than the great general, and the highest success in the
 sea service promises a less brilliant fortune and reputation than equal
 success in the land. The same difference runs through all the inferior
degrees of preferment in both. By the rules of precedency a captain in
the navy ranks with a colonel in the army: but he does not rank with him
 in the common estimation. As the great prizes in the lottery are less,
the smaller ones must be more numerous. Common sailors, therefore, more
frequently get some fortune and preferment than common soldiers; and the
 hope of those prizes is what principally recommends the trade. Though
their skill and dexterity are much superior to that of almost any
artificers, and though their whole life is one continual scene of
hardship and danger, yet for all this dexterity and skill, for all those
 hardships and dangers, while they remain in the condition of common
sailors, they receive scarce any other recompence but the pleasure of
exercising the one and of surmounting the other. Their wages are not
greater than those of common labourers at the port which regulates the
rate of seamen’s wages. As they are continually going from port to port,
 the monthly pay of those who sail from all the different ports of Great
 Britain, is more nearly upon a level than that of any other workmen in
those different places; and the rate of the port to and from which the
greatest number sail, that is the port of London, regulates that of all
the rest. At London the wages of the greater part of the different
classes of workmen are about double those of the same classes at
Edinburgh. But the sailors who sail from the port of London seldom <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>112<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 earn above three or four shillings a month more than those who sail
from the port of Leith, and the difference is frequently not so great.
In time of peace, and in the merchant service, the London price is from a
 guinea to about seven-and-twenty shillings the calendar month. A common
 labourer in London, at the rate of nine or ten shillings a week, may
earn in the calendar month from forty to five-and-forty shillings. The
sailor, indeed, over and above his pay, is supplied with provisions.
Their value, however, may not perhaps always exceed the difference
between his pay and that of the common labourer; and though it sometimes
 should, the excess will not be clear gain to the sailor, because he
cannot share it with his wife and family, whom he must maintain out of
his wages at home.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_495"><span class="type-margin"><span>Dangers which can be surmounted attract, though mere unwholesomeness repels.</span></span>The
 dangers and hair-breadth escapes of a life of adventures, instead of
disheartening young people, seem frequently to recommend a trade to
them. A tender mother, among the inferior ranks of people, is often
afraid to send her son to school at a sea-port town, lest the sight of
the ships and the conversation and adventures of the sailors should
entice him to go to sea. The distant prospect of hazards, from which we
can hope to extricate ourselves by courage and address, is not
disagreeable to us, and does not raise the wages of labour in any
employment. It is otherwise with those in which courage and address can
be of no avail. In trades which are known to be very unwholesome, the
wages of labour are always remarkably high. Unwholesomeness is a species
 of disagreeableness, and its effects upon the wages of labour are to be
 ranked under that general head.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_496"><span class="type-margin"><span>Profits vary with certainty of return.</span></span>In
 all the different employments of stock, the ordinary rate of profit
varies more or less with the certainty or uncertainty of the returns.
These are in general less uncertain in the inland than in the foreign
trade, and in some branches of foreign trade than in others; in the
trade to North America, for example, than in that to Jamaica. The
ordinary rate of profit always rises more or less with the risk. It does
 not, however, seem to rise in proportion to it, or so as to compensate
it completely. Bankruptcies are most frequent in the most hazardous
trades. The most hazardous of all trades, that of a smuggler, though
when the adventure succeeds it is likewise the most profitable, is the
infallible road to bankruptcy. The presumptuous hope of success seems to
 act here as upon all other occasions, and to entice so many adventurers
 into those hazardous trades, that their competition reduces the<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt362" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt362_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 profit below what is sufficient to compensate the risk. To compensate
it completely, the common returns ought, over and above the ordinary
profits of stock, not only to make up for all occasional losses, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>113<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 but to afford a surplus profit to the adventurers of the same nature
with the profit of insurers. But if the common returns were sufficient
for all this, bankruptcies would not be more frequent in these than in
other trades.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt363" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt363_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_497">Of the five circumstances, therefore, which vary the wages of labour,<span class="type-margin"><span>Profits are less unequal than wages, and their inequality is often only due to the inclusion of wages,</span></span>
 two only affect the profits of stock; the agreeableness or
disagreeableness of the business, and the risk or security with which it
 is attended. In point of agreeableness or disagreeableness, there is
little or no difference in the far greater part of the different
employments of stock; but a great deal in those of labour; and the
ordinary profit of stock, though it rises with the risk, does not always
 seem to rise in proportion to it. It should follow from all this, that,
 in the same society or neighbourhood, the average and ordinary rates of
 profit in the different employments of stock should be more nearly upon
 a level than the pecuniary wages of the different sorts of labour. They
 are so accordingly. The difference between the earnings of a common
labourer and those of a well employed lawyer or physician, is evidently
much greater than that between the ordinary profits in any two different
 branches of trade. The apparent difference, besides, in the profits of
different trades, is generally a deception arising from our not always
distinguishing what ought to be considered as wages, from what ought to
be considered as profit.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt364" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt364_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_498">Apothecaries profit is become a bye-word, denoting something uncommonly<span class="type-margin"><span>as in the case of the profit of an apothecary,</span></span>
 extravagant. This great apparent profit, however, is frequently no more
 than the reasonable wages of labour. The skill of an apothecary is a
much nicer and more delicate matter than that of any artificer whatever;
 and the trust which is reposed in him is of much greater importance. He
 is the physician of the poor in all cases, and of the rich when the
distress or danger is not very great. His reward, therefore, ought to be
 suitable to his skill and his trust, and it arises generally from the
price at which he sells his drugs. But the whole drugs which the best
employed apothecary, in a large market town, will sell in a year, may
not perhaps cost him above thirty or forty pounds. Though he should sell
 them, therefore, for three or four hundred, or at a thousand per cent.
profit, this may frequently be no more than the reasonable wages of his
labour charged, in the only way in which he can charge them, upon the
price of his drugs. The greater part of the apparent profit is real
wages disguised in the garb of profit.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>114<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_499"><span class="type-margin"><span>or country grocer.</span></span>In a small sea-port town,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt365" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt365_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 a little grocer will make forty or fifty per cent. upon a stock of a
single hundred pounds, while a considerable wholesale merchant in the
same place will scarce make eight or ten per cent. upon a stock of ten
thousand. The trade of the grocer may be necessary for the conveniency
of the inhabitants, and the narrowness of the market may not admit the
employment of a larger capital in the business. The man, however, must
not only live by his trade, but live by it suitably to the
qualifications which it requires. Besides possessing a little capital,
he must be able to read, write, and account, and must be a tolerable
judge too of, perhaps, fifty or sixty different sorts of goods, their
prices, qualities, and the markets where they are to be had cheapest. He
 must have all the knowledge, in short, that is necessary for a great
merchant, which nothing hinders him from becoming but the want of a
sufficient capital. Thirty or forty pounds a year cannot be considered
as too great a recompence for the labour of a person so accomplished.
Deduct this from the seemingly great profits of his capital, and little
more will remain, perhaps, than the ordinary profits of stock. The
greater part of the apparent profit is, in this case too, real wages.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_500"><span class="type-margin"><span>The greater difference between retail and wholesale profits in town than country is due to the same cause.</span></span>The
 difference between the apparent profit of the retail and that of the
wholesale trade, is much less in the capital than in small towns and
country villages. Where ten thousand pounds can be employed in the
grocery trade, the wages of the grocer’s labour make but a very trifling
 addition to the real profits of so great a stock. The apparent profits
of the wealthy retailer, therefore, are there more nearly upon a level
with those of the wholesale merchant. It is upon this account that goods
 sold by retail are generally as cheap and frequently much cheaper in
the capital than in small towns and country villages.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt366" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt366_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 Grocery goods, for example, are generally much cheaper; bread and
butcher’s meat frequently as cheap. It costs no more to bring grocery
goods to the great town than to the country village; but it costs a
great deal more to bring corn and cattle, as the greater part of them
must be brought from a much greater distance. The prime cost of grocery
goods, therefore, being the same in both places, they are cheapest where
 the least profit is charged upon them. The prime cost of bread and
butcher’s meat is greater in the great town than in the country village;
 and though the profit is less, therefore they are not always cheaper
there, but often equally cheap. In such articles as bread and butcher’s
meat, the same cause, which diminishes <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>115<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 apparent profit, increases prime cost. The extent of the market, by
giving employment to greater stocks, diminishes apparent profit; but by
requiring supplies from a greater distance, it increases prime cost.
This diminution of the one and increase of the other seem, in most
cases, nearly to counter-balance one another; which is probably the
reason that, though the prices of corn and cattle are commonly very
different in different parts of the kingdom, those of bread and
butcher’s meat are generally very nearly the same through the greater
part of it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_501">Though the profits of stock both in the wholesale and retail trade<span class="type-margin"><span>The lesser rate of profit in towns yields larger fortunes, but these mostly arise from speculation.</span></span>
 are generally less in the capital than in small towns and country
villages, yet great fortunes are frequently acquired from small
beginnings in the former, and scarce ever in the latter. In small towns
and country villages, on account of the narrowness of the market, trade
cannot always be extended as stock extends. In such places, therefore,
though the rate of a particular person’s profits may be very high, the
sum or amount of them can never be very great, nor consequently that of
his annual accumulation. In great towns, on the contrary, trade can be
extended as stock increases, and the credit of a frugal and thriving man
 increases much faster than his stock. His trade is extended in
proportion to the amount of both, and the sum or amount of his profits
is in proportion to the extent of his trade, and his annual accumulation
 in proportion to the amount of his profits. It seldom happens, however,
 that great fortunes are made even in great towns by any one regular,
established, and well-known branch of business, but in consequence of a
long life of industry, frugality, and attention. Sudden fortunes,
indeed, are sometimes made in such places by what is called the trade of
 speculation. The speculative merchant exercises no one regular,
established, or well known branch of business. He is a corn merchant
this year, and a wine merchant the next, and a sugar, tobacco, or tea
merchant the year after. He enters into every trade when he foresees
that it is likely to be more than commonly profitable, and he quits it
when he foresees that its profits are likely to return to the level of
other trades. His profits and losses, therefore, can bear no regular
proportion to those of any one established and well-known branch of
business. A bold adventurer may sometimes acquire a considerable fortune
 by two or three successful speculations; but is just as likely to lose
one by two or three unsuccessful ones. This trade can be carried on no
where but in great towns. It is only in places of the most extensive
commerce and correspondence that the intelligence requisite for it can
be had.</p>

<p id="Smith_0206-01_502"><span class="type-margin"><span>The five circumstances thus counter-balance differences of pecuniary gains,</span></span>The
 five circumstances above mentioned, though they occasion considerable
inequalities in the wages of labour and profits of stock, occasion none
in the whole of the advantages and disadvantages, real or imaginary, of
the different employments of either. The nature of those circumstances
is such, that they make up for a small pecuniary gain in some, and
counter-balance a great one in others.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_503"><span class="type-margin"><span>but three things are necessary as well as perfect freedom:</span></span>In
 order, however, that this equality may take place in the whole of their
 advantages or disadvantages, three things are requisite even where
there is the most perfect freedom. First, the employments must be well
known and long established in the neighbourhood; secondly, they must be
in their ordinary, or what may be called their natural state; and,
thirdly, they must be the sole or principal employments of those who
occupy them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_504"><span class="type-margin"><span>(1) the employments must be well known and long established,</span></span>First,
 this equality can take place only in those employments which are well
known, and have been long established in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_505">Where all other circumstances are equal, wages
 are generally higher in new than in old trades. When a projector
attempts to establish a new manufacture,<span class="type-margin"><span>since new trades yield higher wages,</span></span>
 he must at first entice his workmen from other employments by higher
wages than they can either earn in their own trades, or than the nature
of his work would otherwise require, and a considerable time must pass
away before he can venture to reduce them to the common level.
Manufactures for which the demand arises altogether from fashion and
fancy, are continually changing, and seldom last long enough to be
considered as old established manufactures. Those, on the contrary, for
which the demand arises chiefly from use or necessity, are less liable
to change, and the same form or fabric may continue in demand for whole
centuries together. The wages of labour, therefore, are likely to be
higher in manufactures of the former, than in those of the latter kind.
Birmingham deals chiefly in manufactures of the former kind; Sheffield
in those of the latter; and the wages of labour in those two different
places, are said to be suitable to this difference in the nature of
their manufactures.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_506"><span class="type-margin"><span>and higher profits:</span></span>The
 establishment of any new manufacture, of any new branch of commerce, or
 of any new practice in agriculture, is always a speculation, from which
 the projector promises himself extraordinary profits. These profits
sometimes are very great, and sometimes, more frequently, perhaps, they
are quite otherwise; but in general they bear no regular proportion to
those of other old trades in the neighbourhood. If the project succeeds,
 they are commonly at first very high. When the trade or practice
becomes thoroughly established and well known, the competition reduces
them to the level of other trades.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>117<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_507">Secondly, This equality in the whole of the advantages and disadvantages<span class="type-margin"><span>(2) the employments must be in their natural state,</span></span>
 of the different employments of labour and stock, can take place only
in the ordinary, or what may be called the natural state of those
employments.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_508">The demand for almost every different species of labour is sometimes<span class="type-margin"><span>since the demand for labour in each employment varies from time to time</span></span>
 greater and sometimes less than usual. In the one case the advantages
of the employment rise above, in the other they fall below the common
level. The demand for country labour is greater at hay-time and harvest,
 than during the greater part of the year; and wages rise with the
demand. In time of war, when forty or fifty thousand sailors are forced
from the merchant service into that of the king, the demand for sailors
to merchant ships necessarily rises with their scarcity, and their wages
 upon such occasions commonly rise from a guinea and seven-and-twenty
shillings, to forty shillings and three pounds a month. In a decaying
manufacture, on the contrary, many workmen, rather than quit their old
trade, are contented with smaller wages than would otherwise be suitable
 to the nature of their employment.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_509">The profits of stock vary with the price of the commodities in which<span class="type-margin"><span>and profits fluctuate with the price of the commodity produced:</span></span>
 it is employed. As the price of any commodity rises above the ordinary
or average rate, the profits of at least some part of the stock that is
employed in bringing it to market, rise above their proper level, and as
 it falls they sink below it. All commodities are more or less liable to
 variations of price, but some are much more so than others. In all
commodities which are produced by human industry, the quantity of
industry annually employed is necessarily regulated by the annual
demand, in such a manner that the average annual produce may, as nearly
as possible, be equal to the average annual consumption. In some
employments, it has already been observed,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt367" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt367_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 the same quantity of industry will always produce the same, or very
nearly the same quantity of commodities. In the linen or woollen
manufactures, for example, the same number of hands will annually work
up very nearly the same quantity of linen and woollen cloth. The
variations in the market price of such commodities, therefore, can arise
 only from some accidental variation in the demand. A public mourning
raises the price of black cloth.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt368" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt368_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 But as the demand for most sorts of plain linen and woollen cloth is
pretty uniform, so is likewise the price. But there are other
employments in which the same quantity of industry will not always
produce the same quantity of commodities. The same quantity of industry,
 for example, will, in different years, produce very different
quantities of corn, wine, hops, sugar, tobacco, &amp;c. The price <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>118<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of such commodities, therefore, varies not only with the variations of
demand, but with the much greater and more frequent variations of
quantity, and is consequently extremely fluctuating. But the profit of
some of the dealers must necessarily fluctuate with the price of the
commodities. The operations of the speculative merchant are principally
employed about such commodities. He endeavours to buy them up when he
foresees that their price is likely to rise, and to sell them when it is
 likely to fall.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_510"><span class="type-margin"><span>and (3) the
employments must be the principal employment of those who occupy them,
since people maintained by one employment will work cheap at another,
like the Scotch cotters,</span></span>Thirdly, This equality in the
whole of the advantages and disadvantages of the different employments
of labour and stock, can take place only in such as are the sole or
principal employments of those who occupy them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_511">When a person derives his subsistence from one
 employment, which does not occupy the greater part of his time; in the
intervals of his leisure he is often willing to work at another for less
 wages than would otherwise suit the nature of the employment.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_512">There still subsists in many parts of Scotland
 a set of people called Cotters or Cottagers, though they were more
frequent some years ago than they are now. They are a sort of
out-servants of the landlords and farmers. The usual reward which they
receive from their masters is a house, a small garden for pot herbs, as
much grass as will feed a cow, and, perhaps, an acre or two of bad
arable land. When their master has occasion for their labour, he gives
them, besides, two pecks of oatmeal a week, worth about sixteen pence
sterling. During a great part of the year he has little or no occasion
for their labour, and the cultivation of their own little possession is
not sufficient to occupy the time which is left at their own disposal.
When such occupiers were more numerous than they are at present, they
are said to have been willing to give their spare time for a very small
recompence to any body, and to have wrought for less wages than other
labourers. In ancient times they seem to have been common all over
Europe. In countries ill cultivated and worse inhabited, the greater
part of landlords and farmers could not otherwise provide themselves
with the extraordinary number of hands, which country labour requires at
 certain seasons. The daily or weekly recompence which such labourers
occasionally received from their masters, was evidently not the whole
price of their labour. Their small tenement made a considerable part of
it. This daily or weekly recompence, however, seems to have been
considered as the whole of it, by many writers who have collected the
prices of labour and provisions in ancient times, and who have taken

<p id="Smith_0206-01_513">The produce of such labour comes frequently cheaper to market than<span class="type-margin"><span>Shetland knitters,</span></span>
 would otherwise be suitable to its nature. Stockings in many parts of
Scotland are knit much cheaper than they can any-where be wrought upon
the loom. They are the work of servants and labourers, who derive the
principal part of their subsistence from some other employment. More
than a thousand pair of Shetland stockings are annually imported into
Leith, of which the price is from five pence to seven pence a pair. At
Learwick, the small capital of the Shetland islands, ten pence a day, I
have been assured, is a common price of common labour. In the same
islands they knit worsted stockings to the value of a guinea a pair and
upwards.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_514">The spinning of linen yarn is carried on in Scotland nearly in the<span class="type-margin"><span>Scotch linen spinners,</span></span>
 same way as the knitting of stockings, by servants who are chiefly
hired for other purposes. They earn but a very scanty subsistence, who
endeavour to get their whole livelihood by either of those trades. In
most parts of Scotland she is a good spinner who can earn twenty pence a
 week.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_515">In opulent countries the market is generally so extensive, that any<span class="type-margin"><span>and London lodging house keepers.</span></span>
 one trade is sufficient to employ the whole labour and stock of those
who occupy it. Instances of people’s living by one employment, and at
the same time deriving some little advantage from another, occur chiefly
 in poor countries. The following instance, however, of something of the
 same kind is to be found in the capital of a very rich one. There is no
 city in Europe, I believe, in which house-rent is dearer than in
London, and yet I know no capital in which a furnished apartment can be
hired so cheap. Lodging is not only much cheaper in London than in
Paris; it is much cheaper than in Edinburgh of the same degree of
goodness; and what may seem extraordinary, the dearness of house-rent is
 the cause of the cheapness of lodging. The dearness of house-rent in
London arises, not only from those causes which render it dear in all
great capitals, the dearness of labour, the dearness of all the
materials of building, which must generally be brought from a great
distance, and above all the dearness of ground-rent, every landlord
acting the part of a monopolist, and frequently exacting a higher rent
for a single acre of bad land in a town, than can be had for a hundred
of the best in the country; but it arises in part from the peculiar
manners and customs of the people which oblige every master of a family
to hire a whole house from top to bottom. A dwelling-house in England
means every thing that is contained under the same roof. In France,
Scotland, and many other parts of Europe, it frequently means no more
than a single story. A tradesman in <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>120<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 London is obliged to hire a whole house in that part of the town where
his customers live. His shop is upon the ground-floor, and he and his
family sleep in the garret; and he endeavours to pay a part of his
house-rent by letting the two middle stories to lodgers. He expects to
maintain his family by his trade, and not by his lodgers. Whereas, at
Paris and Edinburgh, the people who let lodgings have commonly no other
means of subsistence; and the price of the lodging must pay, not only
the rent of the house, but the whole expence of the family.</p>

<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-01_516"><span class="type-margin"><span>The policy of Europe occasions more important inequalities</span></span>SUCH
 are the inequalities in the whole of the advantages and disadvantages
of the different employments of labour and stock, which the defect of
any of the three requisites above-mentioned must occasion, even where
there is the most perfect liberty. But the policy of Europe, by not
leaving things at perfect liberty, occasions other inequalities of much
greater importance.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_517"><span class="type-margin"><span>in three ways:</span></span>It
 does this chiefly in the three following ways. First, by restraining
the competition in some employments to a smaller number than would
otherwise be disposed to enter into them; secondly, by increasing it in
others beyond what it naturally would be; and, thirdly, by obstructing
the free circulation of labour and stock, both from employment to
employment and from place to place.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_518"><span class="type-margin"><span>(1) It restricts competition in some employments,</span></span>First,
 The policy of Europe occasions a very important inequality in the whole
 of the advantages and disadvantages of the different employments of
labour and stock, by restraining the competition in some employments to a
 smaller number than might otherwise be disposed to enter into them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_519"><span class="type-margin"><span>principally by
 giving exclusive privileges to corporations, which require long
apprenticeship and limit the number of apprentices.</span></span>The exclusive privileges of corporations are the principal means it makes use of for this purpose.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_520">The exclusive privilege of an incorporated
trade necessarily restrains the competition, in the town where it is
established, to those who are free of the trade. To have served an
apprenticeship in the town, under a master properly qualified, is
commonly the necessary requisite for obtaining this freedom. The
bye-laws of the corporation regulate sometimes the number of apprentices
 which any master is allowed to have, and almost always the number of
years which each apprentice is obliged to serve. The intention of both
regulations is to restrain the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>121<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 competition to a much smaller number than might otherwise be disposed
to enter into the trade. The limitation of the number of apprentices
restrains it directly. A long term of apprenticeship restrains it more
indirectly, but as effectually, by increasing the expence of education.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_521">In Sheffield no master cutler can have more
than one apprentice at a time, by a bye-law of the corporation. In
Norfolk and Norwich no master weaver can have more than two apprentices,
 under pain of forfeiting five pounds a month to the king.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt369" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt369_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 No master hatter can have more than two apprentices any-where in
England, or in the English plantations, under pain of forfeiting five

court of record.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt370" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt370_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 Both these regulations, though they have been confirmed by a public law
 of the kingdom, are evidently dictated by the same corporation spirit
which enacted the bye-law of Sheffield.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt371" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt371_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 The silk weavers in London had scarce been incorporated a year when
they enacted a bye-law, restraining any master from having more than two
 apprentices at a time. It required a particular act of parliament to
rescind this bye-law.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt372" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt372_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_522">Seven years seem anciently to have been, all over Europe, the usual<span class="type-margin"><span>Seven years is the usual period of apprenticeship.</span></span>
 term established for the duration of apprenticeships in the greater
part of incorporated trades. All such incorporations were anciently
called universities; which indeed is the proper Latin name for any
incorporation whatever. The university of smiths, the university of
taylors, &amp;c. are expressions which we commonly meet with in the old
charters of ancient towns.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt373" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt373_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a>
 When those particular incorporations which are now peculiarly called
universities were first established, the term of years which it was
necessary to study, in order to obtain the degree of master of arts,
appears evidently to have been copied from the term of apprenticeship in
 common trades, of which the incorporations were much more ancient. As
to have wrought seven years under a master <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>122<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 properly qualified, was necessary, in order to entitle any person to
become a master, and to have himself apprentices in a common trade; so
to have studied seven years under a master properly qualified, was
necessary to entitle him to become a master, teacher, or doctor (words
anciently synonimous) in the liberal arts, and to have scholars or
apprentices (words likewise originally synonimous) to study under him.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_523"><span class="type-margin"><span>The Statute of Apprenticeship, which required it everywhere in England, has been confined to market towns,</span></span>By the 5th of Elizabeth, commonly called the Statute of Apprenticeship,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt374" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt374_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 it was enacted, that no person should for the future exercise any
trade, craft, or mystery at that time exercised in England, unless he
had previously served to it an apprenticeship of seven years at least;
and what before had been the bye-law of many particular corporations,
became in England the general and public law of all trades carried on in
 market towns. For though the words of the statute are very general, and
 seem plainly to include the whole kingdom, by interpretation its
operation has been limited to market towns, it having been held that in
country villages a person may exercise several different trades, though
he has not served a seven years apprenticeship to each, they being
necessary for the conveniency of the inhabitants, and the number of
people frequently not being sufficient to supply each with a particular
set of hands.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt375" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt375_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_524"><span class="type-margin"><span>and to trades existing when it was passed.</span></span>By
 a strict interpretation of the words too the operation of this statute
has been limited to those trades which were established in England
before the 5th of Elizabeth, and has never been extended to such as have
 been introduced since that time.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt376" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt376_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 This limitation has given occasion to several distinctions which,
considered as rules of police, appear as foolish as can well be
imagined. It has been adjudged, for example, that a coach-maker can
neither himself make nor employ journeymen to make his coach-wheels; but
 must buy them of a master wheel-wright; this latter trade having been
exercised in England before the 5th of Elizabeth.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt377" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt377_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 But a wheel-wright, though he has never served an apprenticeship to a
coach-maker, may either himself make or employ journeymen to make
coaches; the trade of a coach-maker not being within the statute,
because not exercised in England at the time when it was made.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt378" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt378_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a> The manufactures of Manchester, Birmingham, and Wolverhampton, are many of them, upon this account, not within <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>123<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the statute; not having been exercised in England before the 5th of Elizabeth.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_525">In France, the duration of apprenticeships is different in different<span class="type-margin"><span>The term varies in France,</span></span>
 towns and in different trades. In Paris, five years is the term
required in a great number; but before any person can be qualified to
exercise the trade as a master, he must, in many of them, serve five
years more as a journeyman. During this latter term he is called the
companion<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt379" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt379_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> of his master, and the term itself is called his companionship.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt380" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt380_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_526">In Scotland there is no general law which regulates universally the<span class="type-margin"><span>and Scotland, where the regulations are less oppressive.</span></span>
 duration of apprenticeships. The term is different in different
corporations. Where it is long, a part of it may generally be redeemed
by paying a small fine. In most towns too a very small fine is
sufficient to purchase the freedom of any corporation. The weavers of
linen and hempen cloth, the principal manufactures of the country, as
well as all other artificers subservient to them, wheel-makers,
reel-makers, &amp;c. may exercise their trades in any town corporate
without paying any fine. In all towns corporate all persons are free to
sell butcher’s meat upon any lawful day of the week. Three years is in
Scotland a common term of apprenticeship, even in some very nice trades;
 and in general I know of no country in Europe in which corporation laws
 are so little oppressive.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_527">The property which every man has in his own labour, as it is the<span class="type-margin"><span>All such regulations are as impertinent as oppressive.</span></span> original foundation of all other property,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt381" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt381_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 so it is the most sacred and inviolable. The patrimony of a poor man
lies in the strength and dexterity of his hands; and to hinder him from
employing this strength and dexterity in what manner he thinks proper
without injury to his neighbour, is a plain violation of this most
sacred property. It is a manifest encroachment upon the just liberty
both of the workman, and of those who might be disposed to employ him.
As it hinders the one from working at what he thinks proper, so it
hinders the others from employing whom they think proper. To judge
whether he is fit to be employed, may surely be trusted to the
discretion of the employers whose interest it so much concerns. The
affected anxiety of the law-giver lest they should employ an improper
person, is evidently as impertinent as it is oppressive.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_528">The institution of long apprenticeships can give no security that<span class="type-margin"><span>Long apprenticeships are no security against bad work,</span></span>
 insufficient workmanship shall not frequently be exposed to public
sale. When this is done it is generally the effect of fraud, and not of
inability; and the longest apprenticeship can give no security against <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>124<span class="bracket">]</span></span> fraud. Quite different regulations are necessary to prevent this abuse. The sterling mark upon plate, and the stamps upon linen<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt382" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt382_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> and woollen cloth,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt383" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt383_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 give the purchaser much greater security than any statute of
apprenticeship. He generally looks at these, but never thinks it worth
while to enquire whether the workmen had served a seven years
apprenticeship.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_529"><span class="type-margin"><span>and do not form young people to industry</span></span>The
 institution of long apprenticeships has no tendency to form young
people to industry. A journeyman who works by the piece is likely to be
industrious, because he derives a benefit from every exertion of his
industry. An apprentice is likely to be idle, and almost always is so,
because he has no immediate interest to be otherwise. In the inferior
employments, the sweets of labour consist altogether in the recompence
of labour. They who are soonest in a condition to enjoy the sweets of
it, are likely soonest to conceive a relish for it, and to acquire the
early habit of industry. A young man naturally conceives an aversion to
labour, when for a long time he receives no benefit from it. The boys
who are put out apprentices from public charities are generally bound
for more than the usual number of years, and they generally turn out
very idle and worthless.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_530"><span class="type-margin"><span>Apprenticeships were unknown to the ancients</span></span>Apprenticeships
 were altogether unknown to the ancients. The reciprocal duties of
master and apprentice make a considerable article in every modern code.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt384" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt384_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 The Roman law is perfectly silent with regard to them. I know no Greek
or Latin word (I might venture, I believe, to assert that there is none)
 which expresses the idea we now annex to the word Apprentice, a servant
 bound to work at a particular trade for the benefit of a master, during
 a term of years, upon condition that the master shall teach him that
trade.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_531"><span class="type-margin"><span>Long apprenticeships are altogether unnecessary</span></span>Long
 apprenticeships are altogether unnecessary. The arts, which are much
superior to common trades, such as those of making clocks and watches,
contain no such mystery as to require a long course of instruction. The
first invention of such beautiful machines, indeed, and even that of
some of the instruments employed in making them, must, no doubt, have
been the work of deep thought and long time, and may justly be
considered as among the happiest efforts of human ingenuity. But when
both have been fairly invented and are well understood, to explain to
any young man, in the completest manner, how to apply the instruments
and how to construct the machines, cannot well require more than the
lessons of a few weeks: perhaps those of a few days <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>125<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 might be sufficient. In the common mechanic trades, those of a few days
 might certainly be sufficient. The dexterity of hand, indeed, even in
common trades, cannot be acquired without much practice and experience.
But a young man would practise with much more diligence and attention,
if from the beginning he wrought as a journeyman, being paid in
proportion to the little work which he could execute, and paying in his
turn for the materials which he might sometimes spoil through
awkwardness and inexperience. His education would generally in this way
be more effectual, and always less tedious and expensive. The master,
indeed, would be a loser. He would lose all the wages of the apprentice,
 which he now saves, for seven years together. In the end, perhaps, the
apprentice himself would be a loser. In a trade so easily learnt he
would have more competitors, and his wages, when he came to be a
complete workman, would be much less than at present. The same increase
of competition would reduce the profits of the masters as well as the
wages of the workmen. The trades, the crafts, the mysteries,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt385" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt385_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> would all be losers. But the public would be a gainer, the work of all artificers coming in this way much cheaper to market.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_532">It is to prevent this reduction of price, and consequently of wages<span class="type-margin"><span>Corporations were established to keep up prices and consequently wages and profit;</span></span>
 and profit, by restraining that free competition which would most
certainly occasion it, that all corporations, and the greater part of
corporation laws, have been established. In order to erect a
corporation, no other authority in ancient times was requisite in many
parts of Europe, but that of the town corporate in which it was
established. In England, indeed, a charter from the king was likewise
necessary. But this prerogative of the crown seems to have been reserved
 rather for extorting money from the subject, than for the defence of
the common liberty against such oppressive monopolies. Upon paying a
fine to the king, the charter seems generally to have been readily
granted; and when any particular class of artificers or traders thought
proper to act as a corporation without a charter, such adulterine
guilds, as they were called, were not always disfranchised upon that
account, but obliged to fine annually to the king for permission to
exercise their usurped privileges.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt386" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt386_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 The immediate inspection of all corporations, and of the bye-laws which
 they might think proper to enact for their own government, belonged to
the town corporate in which they were established; and whatever
discipline was exercised over them, proceeded commonly, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>126<span class="bracket">]</span></span> not from the king, but from that greater incorporation of which those subordinate ones were only parts or members.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt387" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt387_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_533"><span class="type-margin"><span>by means of which the towns gained at the expense of the country,</span></span>The
 government of towns corporate was altogether in the hands of traders
and artificers; and it was the manifest interest of every particular
class of them, to prevent the market from being over-stocked, as they
commonly express it, with their own particular species of industry;
which is in reality to keep it always under-stocked. Each class was
eager to establish regulations proper for this purpose, and, provided it
 was allowed to do so, was willing to consent that every other class
should do the same. In consequence of such regulations, indeed, each
class was obliged to buy the goods they had occasion for from every
other within the town, somewhat dearer than they otherwise might have
done. But in recompence, they were enabled to sell their own just as
much dearer; so that so far it was as broad as long, as they say; and in
 the dealings of the different classes within the town with one another,
 none of them were losers by these regulations. But in their dealings
with the country they were all great gainers; and in these latter
dealings consists the whole trade which supports and enriches every
town.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_534"><span class="type-margin"><span>being enabled
to get the produce of a larger quantity of country labour in exchange
for the produce of a smaller quantity of their own,</span></span>Every
town draws its whole subsistence, and all the materials of its industry,
 from the country. It pays for these chiefly in two ways: first, by
sending back to the country a part of those materials wrought up and
manufactured; in which case their price is augmented by the wages of the
 workmen, and the profits of their masters or immediate employers:
secondly, by sending to it a part both of the rude and manufactured
produce, either of other countries, or of distant parts of the same
country, imported into the town; in which case too the original price of
 those goods is augmented by the wages of the carriers or sailors, and
by the profits of the merchants who employ them. In what is gained upon
the first of those two branches of commerce, consists the advantage
which the town makes by its manufactures; in what is gained upon the
second, the advantage of its inland and foreign trade. The wages of the
workmen, and the profits of their different employers, make up the whole
 of what is gained upon both. Whatever regulations, therefore, tend to
increase those wages and profits beyond what they otherwise would be,
tend to enable the town to purchase, with a smaller quantity of its
labour, the produce of a greater quantity of the labour of the country.
They give the traders and artificers in the town an advantage over the
landlords, farmers, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>127<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 and labourers in the country, and break down that natural equality
which would otherwise take place in the commerce which is carried on
between them. The whole annual produce of the labour of the society is
annually divided between those two different sets of people. By means of
 those regulations a greater share of it is given to the inhabitants of
the town than would otherwise fall to them; and a less to those of the
country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_535">The price which the town really pays for the provisions and materials<span class="type-margin"><span>as the exports of a town are the real price of its imports.</span></span>
 annually imported into it, is the quantity of manufactures and other
goods annually exported from it. The dearer the latter are sold, the
cheaper the former are bought. The industry of the town becomes more,
and that of the country less advantageous.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_536">That the industry which is carried on in towns is, every-where in<span class="type-margin"><span>That town industry is better paid is shown by the large fortunes made in it.</span></span>
 Europe, more advantageous than that which is carried on in the country,
 without entering into any very nice computations, we may satisfy
ourselves by one very simple and obvious observation. In every country
of Europe we find, at least, a hundred people who have acquired great
fortunes from small beginnings by trade and manufactures, the industry
which properly belongs to towns, for one who has done so by that which
properly belongs to the country, the raising of rude produce by the
improvement and cultivation of land. Industry, therefore, must be better
 rewarded, the wages of labour and the profits of stock must evidently
be greater in the one situation than in the other.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt388" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt388_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 But stock and labour naturally seek the most advantageous employment.
They naturally, therefore, resort as much as they can to the town, and
desert the country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_537">The inhabitants of a town, being collected into one place, can easily<span class="type-margin"><span>Combination is easy to the inhabitants of a town,</span></span>
 combine together. The most insignificant trades carried on in towns
have accordingly, in some place or other, been incorporated; and even
where they have never been incorporated, yet the corporation spirit, the
 jealousy of strangers, the aversion to take apprentices, or to
communicate the secret of their trade, generally prevail in them, and
often teach them, by voluntary associations and agreements, to prevent
that free competition which they cannot prohibit by bye-laws. The trades
 which employ but a small number of hands, run most easily into such
combinations. Half a dozen wool-combers, perhaps, are necessary to keep a
 thousand spinners and weavers at work. By combining not to take
apprentices they can not only engross the employment, but reduce the
whole manufacture into a sort of slavery to themselves, and raise <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>128<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the price of their labour much above what is due to the nature of their work.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_538"><span class="type-margin"><span>and difficult
to those of the country, who are dispersed and not governed by the
corporation spirit. No apprenticeship is prescribed for farming, though a
 difficult art,</span></span>The inhabitants of the country, dispersed in distant places, cannot easily combine together.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt389" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt389_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 They have not only never been incorporated, but the corporation spirit
never has prevailed among them. No apprenticeship has ever been thought
necessary to qualify for husbandry, the great trade of the country.
After what are called the fine arts, and the liberal professions,
however, there is perhaps no trade which requires so great a variety of
knowledge and experience. The innumerable volumes which have been
written upon it in all languages, may satisfy us, that among the wisest
and most learned nations, it has never been regarded as a matter very
easily understood. And from all those volumes we shall in vain attempt
to collect that knowledge of its various and complicated operations,
which is commonly possessed even by the common farmer; how
contemptuously soever the very contemptible authors of some of them may
sometimes affect to speak of him. There is scarce any common mechanic
trade, on the contrary, of which all the operations may not be as
completely and distinctly explained in a pamphlet of a very few pages,
as it is possible for words illustrated by figures to explain them. In
the history of the arts, now publishing by the French academy of
sciences,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt390" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt390_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 several of them are actually explained in this manner. The direction of
 operations, besides, which must be varied with every change of the

 only the art of the farmer, the general direction of the operations of
husbandry, but many inferior branches of country labour, require much
more skill and experience than the greater part of mechanic trades. The
man who works upon brass and iron, works with instruments and upon
materials of which the temper is always the same, or very nearly the
same. But the man who ploughs the ground with a team of horses or oxen,
works with instruments of which the health, strength, and temper, are
very different upon different occasions. The condition of the materials
which he works upon too is as variable as that of the instruments which
he works with, and both require to be managed with much judgment and
discretion. The common ploughman, though generally regarded as the
pattern of stupidity and ignorance, is seldom defective in this judgment
 and discretion. He is less <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>129<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 accustomed, indeed, to social intercourse than the mechanic who lives
in a town. His voice and language are more uncouth and more difficult to
 be understood by those who are not used to them. His understanding,
however, being accustomed to consider a greater variety of objects, is
generally much superior to that of the other, whose whole attention from
 morning till night is commonly occupied in performing one or two very
simple operations. How much the lower ranks of people in the country are
 really superior to those of the town, is well known to every man whom
either business or curiosity has led to converse much with both.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt391" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt391_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 In China and Indostan accordingly both the rank and the wages of
country labourers are said to be superior to those of the greater part
of artificers and manufacturers. They would probably be so every-where,
if corporation laws and the corporation spirit did not prevent it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_540">The superiority which the industry of the towns has every-where in<span class="type-margin"><span>The superiority of town industry is enhanced by other regulations, such as high duties on foreign manufactures.</span></span>
 Europe over that of the country, is not altogether owing to
corporations and corporation laws. It is supported by many other
regulations. The high duties upon foreign manufactures and upon all
goods imported by alien merchants, all tend to the same purpose.
Corporation laws enable the inhabitants of towns to raise their prices,
without fearing to be under-sold by the free competition of their own
countrymen. Those other regulations secure them equally against that of
foreigners. The enhancement of price occasioned by both is every-where
finally paid by the landlords, farmers, and labourers of the country,
who have seldom opposed the establishment of such monopolies. They have
commonly neither inclination nor fitness to enter into combinations; and
 the clamour and sophistry of merchants and manufacturers easily
persuade them that the private interest of a part, and of a subordinate
part of the society, is the general interest of the whole.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_541">In Great Britain the superiority of the industry of the towns over<span class="type-margin"><span>The superiority has declined in Great Britain.</span></span>
 that of the country, seems to have been greater formerly than in the
present times. The wages of country labour approach nearer to those of
manufacturing labour, and the profits of stock employed in agriculture
to those of trading and manufacturing stock, than they are said to have
done in the last century, or in the beginning of the present. This
change may be regarded as the necessary, though very late consequence of
 the extraordinary encouragement given to the industry of the towns. The
 stock accumulated in them comes in time to be so great, that it can no
longer be employed with the ancient profit in that species of industry
which is peculiar to them. That <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>130<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 industry has its limits like every other; and the increase of stock, by
 increasing the competition, necessarily reduces the profit. The
lowering of profit in the town forces out stock to the country, where,
by creating a new demand for country labour, it necessarily raises its
wages. It then spreads itself, if I may say so, over the face of the
land, and by being employed in agriculture is in part restored to the
country, at the expence of which, in a great measure, it had originally
been accumulated in the town. That every-where in Europe the greatest
improvements of the country have been owing to such overflowings of the
stock originally accumulated in the towns, I shall endeavour to show
hereafter;<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt392" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt392_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 and at the same time to demonstrate, that though some countries have by
 this course attained to a considerable degree of opulence, it is in
itself necessarily slow, uncertain, liable to be disturbed and
interrupted by innumerable accidents, and in every respect contrary to
the order of nature and of reason. The interests, prejudices, laws and
customs which have given occasion to it, I shall endeavour to explain as
 fully and distinctly as I can in the third and fourth books of this
inquiry.</p>

prevent such meetings, by any law which either could be executed, or
would be consistent with liberty and justice. But though the law cannot
hinder people of the same trade from sometimes assembling together, it
ought to do nothing to facilitate such assemblies; much less to render
them necessary.</p>

 regulation which obliges all those of the same trade in a particular

<p id="Smith_0206-01_545">An incorporation not only renders them
necessary, but makes the act of the majority binding upon the whole. In a
 free trade an effectual combination cannot be established but by the
unanimous consent of every single trader,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt393" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt393_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> and it cannot last longer than every single trader continues of the same mind.<span class="type-margin"><span>or by incorporation.</span></span> The majority of a corporation can <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>131<span class="bracket">]</span></span>

 more effectually and more durably than any voluntary combination
whatever.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_546">The pretence that corporations are necessary for the better government<span class="type-margin"><span>Corporations are unnecessary, and corrupt the workmen.</span></span>
 of the trade, is without any foundation. The real and effectual
discipline which is exercised over a workman, is not that of his
corporation, but that of his customers. It is the fear of losing their
employment which restrains his frauds and corrects his negligence. An
exclusive corporation necessarily weakens the force of this discipline. A
 particular set of workmen must then be employed, let them behave well
or ill. It is upon this account, that in many large incorporated towns
no tolerable workmen are to be found, even in some of the most necessary
 trades. If you would have your work tolerably executed, it must be done
 in the suburbs, where the workmen, having no exclusive privilege, have
nothing but their character to depend upon, and you must then smuggle it
 into the town as well as you can.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_547">It is in this manner that the policy of
Europe, by restraining the competition in some employments to a smaller
number than would otherwise be disposed to enter into them, occasions a
very important inequality in the whole of the advantages and
disadvantages of the different employments of labour and stock.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_548">Secondly, The policy of Europe, by increasing the competition in<span class="type-margin"><span>(2) The policy of Europe increases competition in some trades.</span></span>

inequality of an opposite kind in the whole of the advantages and
disadvantages of the different employments of labour and stock.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_549">It has been considered as of so much importance that a proper<span class="type-margin"><span>It cheapens the education of the clergy and thereby reduces their earnings;</span></span>
 number of young people should be educated for certain professions,
that, sometimes the public, and sometimes the piety of private founders
have established many pensions, scholarships, exhibitions, bursaries,
&amp;c. for this purpose, which draw many more people into those trades
than could otherwise pretend to follow them. In all christian countries,
 I believe, the education of the greater part of churchmen is paid for
in this manner. Very few of them are educated altogether at their own
expence. The long, tedious, and expensive education, therefore, of those
 who are, will not always procure them a suitable reward, the church
being crowded with people who, in order to get employment, are willing
to accept of a much smaller recompence than what such an education would
 otherwise have entitled them to; and in this manner the competition of
the poor takes away the reward of the rich. It would be indecent, no
doubt, to compare either a curate or a chaplain with a journeyman in any
 common trade. The pay of a curate or <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>132<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 chaplain, however, may very properly be considered as of the same
nature with the wages of a journeyman. They are, all three, paid for
their work according to the contract which they may happen to make with
their respective superiors. Till after the middle of the fourteenth
century, five merks, containing about as much silver as ten pounds of
our present money, was in England the usual pay of a curate or<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt394" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt394_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> stipendiary parish priest, as we find it regulated by the decrees of several different national councils.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt395" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt395_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 At the same period four pence a day, containing the same quantity of
silver as a shilling of our present money, was declared to be the pay of
 a master mason, and three pence a day, equal to nine pence of our
present money, that of a journeyman mason.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt396" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt396_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 The wages of both these labourers, therefore, supposing them to have
been constantly employed, were much superior to those of the curate. The
 wages of the master mason, supposing him to have been without
employment one third of the year, would have fully equalled them. By the
 12th of Queen Anne, c. 12, it is declared, “That whereas for want of
sufficient maintenance and encouragement to curates, the cures have in
several places been meanly supplied, the bishop is, therefore, empowered
 to appoint by writing under his hand and seal a sufficient certain
stipend or allowance, not exceeding fifty and not less than twenty
pounds a year.”<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt397" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt397_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 Forty pounds a year is reckoned at present very good pay for a curate,
and notwithstanding this act of parliament, there are many curacies
under twenty pounds a year. There are journeymen shoemakers in London
who earn forty pounds a year, and there is scarce an industrious workman
 of any kind in that metropolis who does not earn more than twenty. This
 last sum indeed does not exceed what is frequently earned by common
labourers in many country parishes. Whenever the law has attempted to
regulate the wages of workmen, it has always been rather to lower them
than to raise them. But the law has upon many occasions attempted to
raise the wages of curates, and for the dignity of the church, to oblige
 the rectors of parishes to give them more than the wretched maintenance
 which they themselves might be willing to accept of. And in both cases
the law seems to have been equally ineffectual, and has never either
been able to raise the wages of curates, or to sink those of labourers
to the degree that was intended; because it has never been able to
hinder either the one from being willing to accept of less than <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>133<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 the legal allowance, on account of the indigence of their situation and
 the multitude of their competitors; or the other from receiving more,
on account of the contrary competition of those who expected to derive
either profit or pleasure from employing them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_550">The great benefices and other ecclesiastical dignities support the<span class="type-margin"><span>so that it is only the great benefices, etc., which support the honour of the English and Roman Catholic Churches.</span></span>
 honour of the church, notwithstanding the mean circumstances of some of
 its inferior members. The respect paid to the profession too makes some
 compensation even to them for the meanness of their pecuniary
recompence. In England, and in all Roman Catholic countries, the lottery
 of the church is in reality much more advantageous than is necessary.
The example of the churches of Scotland, of Geneva, and of several other
 protestant churches, may satisfy us, that in so creditable a
profession, in which education is so easily procured, the hopes of much
more moderate benefices will draw a sufficient number of learned,
decent, and respectable men into holy orders.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_551">In professions in which there are no benefices, such as law and physic,<span class="type-margin"><span>The same cause, if present, would lower the reward of lawyers and physicians,</span></span>
 if an equal proportion of people were educated at the public expence,
the competition would soon be so great, as to sink very much their
pecuniary reward. It might then not be worth any man’s while to educate
his son to either of those professions at his own expence. They would be
 entirely abandoned to such as had been educated by those public
charities, whose numbers and necessities would oblige them in general to
 content themselves with a very miserable recompence, to the entire
degradation of the now respectable professions of law and physic.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_552">That unprosperous race of men commonly called men of letters, are<span class="type-margin"><span>as it has done that of men of letters,</span></span>
 pretty much in the situation which lawyers and physicians probably
would be in upon the foregoing supposition. In every part of Europe the
greater part of them have been educated for the church, but have been
hindered by different reasons from entering into holy orders. They have
generally, therefore, been educated at the public expence, and their
numbers are every-where so great as commonly to reduce the price of
their labour to a very paultry recompence.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_553">Before the invention of the art of printing, the only employment by<span class="type-margin"><span>and that of teachers,</span></span> which a man of letters could make any thing by his talents, was that of a public or private<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt398" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt398_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 teacher, or by communicating to other people the curious and useful
knowledge which he had acquired himself: And this is still surely a more
 honourable, a more useful, and in general even a more profitable
employment than that other of writing for a bookseller, to which the art
 of printing has given occasion. The time and study, the genius,
knowledge, and application requisite to qualify <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>134<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 an eminent teacher of the sciences, are at least equal to what is
necessary for the greatest practitioners in law and physic. But the
usual reward of the eminent teacher bears no proportion to that of the
lawyer or physician; because the trade of the one is crowded with
indigent people who have been brought up to it at the public expence;
whereas those of the other two are incumbered with very few who have not
 been educated at their own. The usual recompence, however, of public
and private teachers, small as it may appear, would undoubtedly be less
than it is, if the competition of those yet more indigent men of letters
 who write for bread was not taken out of the market. Before the
invention of the art of printing, a scholar and a beggar seem to have
been terms very nearly synonymous. The different governors of the
universities before that time appear to have often granted licences to
their scholars to beg.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt399" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt399_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_554"><span class="type-margin"><span>who were much better paid in ancient times.</span></span>In
 ancient times, before any charities of this kind had been established
for the education of indigent people to the learned professions, the
rewards of eminent teachers appear to have been much more considerable.
Isocrates, in what is called his discourse against the sophists,
reproaches the teachers of his own times with inconsistency. “They make
the most magnificent promises to their scholars, says he, and undertake
to teach them to be wise, to be happy, and to be just, and in return for
 so important a service they stipulate the paultry reward of four or
five minæ. They who teach wisdom, continues he, ought certainly to be
wise themselves; but if any man were<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt400" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt400_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> to sell such a bargain for such a price, he would be convicted of the most evident folly.”<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt401" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt401_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 He certainly does not mean here to exaggerate the reward, and we may be
 assured that it was not less than he represents it. Four minæ were
equal to thirteen pounds six shillings and eight pence: five minæ to
sixteen pounds thirteen shillings and four pence. Something not less
than the largest of those two sums, therefore, must at that time have
been usually paid to the most eminent teachers at Athens. Isocrates
himself demanded ten minæ,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt402" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt402_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 or thirty-three pounds six shillings and eight pence, from each
scholar. When he taught at Athens, he is said to have had an hundred
scholars. I understand this to be the number whom he taught at one time,
 or who attended what we would call one course of lectures, a number
which will not appear <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>135<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 extraordinary from so great a city to so famous a teacher, who taught
too what was at that time the most fashionable of all sciences,
rhetoric. He must have made, therefore, by each course of lectures, a
thousand minæ, or 3,333<span class="ital">l.</span> 6<span class="ital">s.</span> 8<span class="ital">d.</span> A thousand minæ, accordingly, is said by Plutarch in another place, to have been his Didactron, or usual price of teaching.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt403" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt403_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Many other eminent teachers in those times appear to have acquired
great fortunes. Gorgias made a present to the temple of Delphi of his
own statue in solid gold.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt404" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt404_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 We must not, I presume, suppose that it was as large as the life. His
way of living, as well as that of Hippias and Protagoras, two other
eminent teachers of those times, is represented by Plato as splendid
even to ostentation.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt405" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt405_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 Plato himself is said to have lived with a good deal of magnificence.
Aristotle, after having been tutor to Alexander, and most munificently
rewarded, as it is universally agreed, both by him and his father
Philip,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt406" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt406_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 thought it worth while, notwithstanding, to return to Athens, in order
to resume the teaching of his school. Teachers of the sciences were
probably in those times less common than they came to be in an age or
two afterwards, when the competition had probably somewhat reduced both
the price of their labour and the admiration for their persons. The most
 eminent of them, however, appear always to have enjoyed a degree of
consideration much superior to any of the like profession in the present
 times. The Athenians sent Carneades the academic, and Diogenes the
stoic, upon a solemn embassy to Rome; and though their city had then
declined from its former grandeur, it was still an independent and
considerable republic. Carneads too was a Babylonian by birth,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt407" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt407_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a>
 and as there never was a people more jealous of admitting foreigners to
 public offices than the Athenians, their consideration for him must
have been very great.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_555">This inequality is upon the whole, perhaps, rather advantageous<span class="type-margin"><span>Perhaps this cheapness of teaching is no disadvantage to the public.</span></span>
 than hurtful to the public. It may somewhat degrade the profession of a
 public teacher; but the cheapness of literary education is surely an
advantage which greatly over-balances this trifling inconveniency. The
public too might derive still greater benefit from it, if the
constitution <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>136<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of those schools and colleges, in which education is carried on, was
more reasonable than it is at present through the greater part of
Europe.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt408" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt408_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>

 The policy of Europe, by obstructing the free circulation of labour and
 stock both from employment to employment, and from place to place,
occasions in some cases a very inconvenient inequality in the whole of
the advantages and disadvantages of their different employments.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_557"><span class="type-margin"><span>Apprenticeship and corporation privileges obstruct circulation from employment to employment and from place to place.</span></span>The statute of apprenticeship<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt409" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt409_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 obstructs the free circulation of labour from one employment to
another, even in the same place. The exclusive privileges of
corporations obstruct it from one place to another, even in the same
employment.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_558">It frequently happens that while high wages
are given to the workmen in one manufacture, those in another are
obliged to content themselves with bare subsistence. The one is in an
advancing state, and has, therefore, a continual demand for new hands:
The other is in a declining state, and the super-abundance of hands is
continually increasing. Those two manufactures may sometimes be in the
same town, and sometimes in the same neighbourhood, without being able
to lend the least assistance to one another.<span class="type-margin"><span>So that the changes of employment necessary to equalise wages are prevented.</span></span>
 The statute of apprenticeship may oppose it in the one case, and both
that and an exclusive corporation in the other. In many different
manufactures, however, the operations are so much alike, that the
workmen could easily change trades with one another, if those absurd
laws did not hinder them. The arts of weaving plain linen and plain
silk, for example, are almost entirely the same. That of weaving plain
woollen is somewhat different; but the difference is so insignificant,
that either a linen or a silk weaver might become a tolerable workman in
 a very few days. If any of those three capital manufactures, therefore,
 were decaying, the workmen might find a resource in one of the other
two which was in a more prosperous condition; and their wages would
neither rise too high in the thriving, nor sink too low in the decaying
manufacture. The linen manufacture indeed is, in England, by a
particular statute,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt410" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt410_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 open to every body; but as it is not much cultivated through the
greater part of the country, it can afford no general resource to the
workmen of other decaying manufactures, who, wherever the statute of
apprenticeship takes place, have no other choice but either to come upon
 the parish, or to work as common labourers, for which, by their habits,
 they are much worse qualified than for any sort of manufacture <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>137<span class="bracket">]</span></span> that bears any resemblance to their own. They generally, therefore, chuse to come upon the parish.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_559">Whatever obstructs the free circulation of labour from one employment<span class="type-margin"><span>What obstructs the circulation of labour also obstructs that of stock.</span></span>
 to another, obstructs that of stock likewise; the quantity of stock
which can be employed in any branch of business depending very much upon
 that of the<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt411" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt411_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 labour which can be employed in it. Corporation laws, however, give
less obstruction to the free circulation of stock from one place to
another than to that of labour. It is everywhere much easier for a
wealthy merchant to obtain the privilege of trading in a town corporate,
 than for a poor artificer to obtain that of working in it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_560">The obstruction which corporation laws give to the free circulation<span class="type-margin"><span>In England the circulation of labour is further obstructed by the poor law.</span></span> of labour is common, I believe, to every part of Europe.

 peculiar to England. It consists in the difficulty which a poor man
finds in obtaining a settlement, or even in being allowed to exercise
his industry in any parish but that to which he belongs. It is the
labour of artificers and manufacturers only of which the free
circulation is obstructed by corporation laws. The difficulty of
obtaining settlements obstructs even that of common labour. It may be
worth while to give some account of the rise, progress, and present
state of this disorder, the greatest perhaps of any in the police of
England.</p>

 a year, or could give such security for the discharge of the parish
where he was then living, as those justices should judge sufficient.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_563"><span class="type-margin"><span>Notice in writing was required from the new inhabitant by 1 James II.</span></span>Some
 frauds, it is said, were committed in consequence of this statute;
parish officers sometimes bribing their own poor to go clandestinely to
another parish, and by keeping themselves concealed for forty days to
gain a settlement there, to the discharge of that to which they properly
 belonged. It was enacted, therefore, by the 1st of James II.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt415" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt415_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 that the forty days undisturbed residence of any person necessary to
gain a settlement, should be accounted only from the time of his
delivering notice in writing, of the place of his abode and the number
of his family, to one of the churchwardens or overseers of the parish
where he came to dwell.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_564"><span class="type-margin"><span>Such notice was to be published in church under 3 W III.</span></span>But
 parish officers, it seems, were not always more honest with regard to
their own, than they had been with regard to other parishes, and
sometimes connived at such intrusions, receiving the notice, and taking
no proper steps in consequence of it. As every person in a parish,
therefore, was supposed to have an interest to prevent as much as
possible their being burdened by such intruders, it was further enacted
by the 3d of William III.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt416" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt416_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 that the forty days residence should be accounted only from the
publication of such notice in writing on Sunday in the church,
immediately after divine service.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_565">“After all,” says Doctor Burn, “this kind of
settlement, by continuing forty days after publication of notice in
writing, is very seldom obtained; and the design of the acts is not so
much for gaining of settlements, as for the avoiding of them by persons
coming into a parish clandestinely: for the giving of notice is only
putting a force upon the parish to remove. But if a person’s situation
is such, that it is doubtful whether he is actually removeable or not,
he shall by giving of notice compel the parish either to allow him a
settlement uncontested, by suffering him to continue forty days; or, by
removing him, to try the right.”<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt417" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt417_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_566">This statute, therefore, rendered it almost impracticable for a poor <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>139<span class="bracket">]</span></span> man to gain a new settlement in the old way, by forty days inhabitancy.<span class="type-margin"><span>There were four other ways of gaining a settlement,</span></span>
 But that it might not appear to preclude altogether the common people
of one parish from ever establishing themselves with security in
another, it appointed four other ways by which a settlement might be
gained without any notice delivered or published. The first was, by
being taxed to parish rates and paying them; the second, by being
elected into an annual parish office, and serving in it a year; the
third, by serving an apprenticeship in the parish; the fourth, by being
hired into service there for a year, and continuing in the same service
during the whole of it.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt418" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt418_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_567">Nobody can gain a settlement by either of the two first ways, but by<span class="type-margin"><span>two of which were impossible to all poor men,</span></span>
 the public deed of the whole parish, who are too well aware of the
consequences to adopt any new-comer who has nothing but his labour to
support him, either by taxing him to parish rates, or by electing him
into a parish office.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_568">No married man can well gain any settlement in either of the two<span class="type-margin"><span>and the other two to all married men.</span></span>
 last ways. An apprentice is scarce ever married; and it is expressly
enacted, that no married servant shall gain any settlement by being
hired for a year.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt419" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt419_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 The principal effect of introducing settlement by service, has been to
put out in a great measure the old fashion of hiring for a year, which
before had been so customary in England, that even at this day, if no
particular term is agreed upon, the law intends that every servant is
hired for a year. But masters are not always willing to give their
servants a settlement by hiring them in this manner; and servants are
not always willing to be so hired, because, as every last settlement
discharges all the foregoing, they might thereby lose their original
settlement in the places of their nativity, the habitation of their
parents and relations.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_569">No independent workman, it is evident, whether labourer or artificer,<span class="type-margin"><span>and to all independent workmen</span></span>
 is likely to gain any new settlement either by apprenticeship or by
service. When such a person, therefore, carried his industry to a new
parish, he was liable to be removed, how healthy and industrious soever,
 at the caprice of any churchwarden or overseer, unless he either rented
 a tenement of ten pounds a year, a thing impossible for one who has
nothing but his labour to live by; or could give such security for the
discharge of the parish as two justices of the peace should judge
sufficient. What security they shall require, indeed, is left altogether
 to their discretion; but they cannot well require less than thirty
pounds, it having been enacted, that the purchase even of a freehold
estate of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>140<span class="bracket">]</span></span> less than thirty pounds value, shall not gain any person a settlement, as not being sufficient for the discharge of the parish.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt420" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt420_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> But this is a security which scarce any man who lives by labour can give; and much greater security is frequently demanded.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_570"><span class="type-margin"><span>Certificates
were invented to enable persons to reside in a parish without being
immediately removable and without gaining a settlement.</span></span>In
order to restore in some measure that free circulation of labour which
those different statutes had almost entirely taken away,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt421" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt421_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> the invention of certificates was fallen upon. By the 8th and 9th of William III.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt422" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt422_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 it was enacted, that if any person should bring a certificate from the
parish where he was last legally settled, subscribed by the
churchwardens and overseers of the poor, and allowed by two justices of
the peace, that every other parish should be obliged to receive him;
that he should not be removeable merely upon account of his being likely
 to become chargeable, but only upon his becoming actually chargeable,
and that then the parish which granted the certificate should be obliged
 to pay the expence both of his maintenance and of his removal. And in
order to give the most perfect security to the parish where such
certificated man should come to reside, it was further enacted by the
same statute,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt423" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt423_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 that he should gain no settlement there by any means whatever, except
either by renting a tenement of ten pounds a year, or by serving upon
his own account in an annual parish office for one whole year; and
consequently neither by notice, nor by service, nor by apprenticeship,
nor by paying parish rates. By the 12th of Queen Anne too, stat. 1. c.
18. it was further enacted, that neither the servants nor apprentices of
 such certificated man should gain any settlement in the parish where he
 resided under such certificate.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt424" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt424_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>141<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_571">How far this invention has restored that free circulation of labour<span class="type-margin"><span>Certificates were required by the new parish but refused by the old.</span></span>
 which the preceding statutes had almost entirely taken away, we may
learn from the following very judicious observation of Doctor Burn. “It
is obvious,” says he, “that there are divers good reasons for requiring
certificates with persons coming to settle in any place; namely, that
persons residing under them can gain no settlement, neither by
apprenticeship, nor by service, nor by giving notice, nor by paying
parish rates; that they can settle neither apprentices nor servants;
that if they become chargeable, it is certainly known whither to remove
them, and the parish shall be paid for the removal, and for their
maintenance in the mean time; and that if they fall sick, and cannot be
removed, the parish which gave the certificate must maintain them: none
of all which can be without a certificate. Which reasons will hold
proportionably for parishes not granting certificates in ordinary cases;
 for it is far more than an equal chance, but that they will have the
certificated persons again, and in a worse condition.”<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt425" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt425_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The moral of this observation seems to be, that certificates ought
always to be required by the parish where any poor man comes to reside,
and that they ought very seldom to be granted by that which he proposes
to leave. “There is somewhat of hardship in this matter of
certificates,” says the same very intelligent Author, in his History of
the Poor Laws, “by putting it in the power of a parish officer, to
imprison a man as it were for life; however inconvenient it may be for
him to continue at that place where he has had the misfortune to acquire
 what is called a settlement, or whatever advantage he may propose to
himself by living elsewhere.”<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt426" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt426_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_572">Though a certificate carries along with it no testimonial of good behaviour,<span class="type-margin"><span>The courts declined to force overseers to give a certificate.</span></span>
 and certifies nothing but that the person belongs to the parish to
which he really does belong, it is altogether discretionary in the
parish officers either to grant or to refuse it. A mandamus was once
moved for, says Doctor Burn, to compel the churchwardens and overseers
to sign a certificate; but the court of King’s Bench rejected the motion
 as a very strange attempt.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt427" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt427_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_573">The very unequal price of labour which we frequently find in England<span class="type-margin"><span>This law is the cause of the very unequal price of labour in England,</span></span> in places at no great distance from one another, is probably owing <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>142<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 to the obstruction which the law of settlements gives to a poor man who
 would carry his industry from one parish to another without a
certificate. A single man, indeed, who is healthy and industrious, may
sometimes reside by sufferance without one; but a man with a wife and
family who should attempt to do so, would in most parishes be sure of
being removed, and if the single man should afterwards marry, he would
generally be removed likewise.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt428" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt428_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The scarcity of hands in one parish, therefore, cannot always be
relieved by their super-abundance in another, as it is constantly in
Scotland, and, I believe, in all other countries where there is no
difficulty of settlement. In such countries, though wages may sometimes
rise a little in the neighbourhood of a great town, or wherever else
there is an extraordinary demand for labour, and sink gradually as the
distance from such places increases, till they fall back to the common
rate of the country; yet we never meet with those sudden and
unaccountable differences in the wages of neighbouring places which we
sometimes find in England, where it is often more difficult for a poor
man to pass the artificial boundary of a parish, than an arm of the sea
or a ridge of high mountains, natural boundaries which sometimes
separate very distinctly different rates of wages in other countries.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_574"><span class="type-margin"><span>and an evident violation of natural liberty, though tamely submitted to</span></span>To
 remove a man who has committed no misdemeanour from the parish where he
 chuses to reside, is an evident violation of natural liberty and
justice. The common people of England, however, so jealous of their
liberty, but like the common people of most other countries never
rightly understanding wherein it consists, have now for more than a
century together suffered themselves to be exposed to this oppression
without a remedy. Though men of reflection too have sometimes complained
 of the law of settlements as a public grievance; yet it has never been
the object of any general popular clamour, such as that against general
warrants, an abusive practice undoubtedly, but such a one as was not
likely to occasion any general oppression. There is scarce a poor man in
 England of forty years of age, I will venture to say, who has not in
some part of his life felt himself most cruelly oppressed<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt429" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt429_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> by this ill-contrived law of settlements.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_575"><span class="type-margin"><span>Wages were anciently rated by law or by justices of peace.</span></span>I
 shall conclude this long chapter with observing, that though anciently
it was usual to rate wages, first by general laws extending <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>143<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 over the whole kingdom, and afterwards by particular orders of the
justices of peace in every particular county, both these practices have
now gone entirely into disuse. “By the experience of above four hundred
years,” says Doctor Burn, “it seems time to lay aside all endeavours to
bring under strict regulations, what in its own nature seems incapable
of minute limitation: for if all persons in the same kind of work were
to receive equal wages, there would be no emulation, and no room left
for industry or ingenuity.”<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt430" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt430_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_576">Particular acts of parliament, however, still attempt sometimes to<span class="type-margin"><span>London tailors’ wages are still rated by law.</span></span> regulate wages in particular trades and in particular places. Thus the 8th of George III.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt431" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt431_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 prohibits under heavy penalties all master taylors in London, and five
miles round it, from giving, and their workmen from accepting, more than
 two shillings and sevenpence halfpenny a day, except in the case of a
general mourning. Whenever the legislature attempts to regulate the
differences between masters and their workmen, its counsellors are
always the masters. When the regulation, therefore, is in favour of the
workmen, it is always just and equitable; but it is sometimes otherwise
when in favour of the masters. Thus the law which obliges the masters in
 several different trades to pay their workmen in money and not in
goods, is quite just and equitable.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt432" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt432_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 It imposes no real hardship upon the masters. It only obliges them to
pay that value in money, which they pretended to pay, but did not always
 really pay, in goods. This law is in favour of the workmen; but the 8th
 of George III. is in favour of the masters. When masters combine
together in order to reduce the wages of their workmen, they commonly
enter into a private bond or agreement, not to give more than a certain
wage under a certain penalty. Were the workmen to enter into a contrary
combination of the same kind, not to accept of a certain wage under a
certain penalty, the law would punish them <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>144<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 very severely; and if it dealt impartially, it would treat the masters
in the same manner. But the 8th of George III. enforces by law that very
 regulation which masters sometimes attempt to establish by such
combinations. The complaint of the workmen, that it puts the ablest and
most industrious upon the same footing with an ordinary workman, seems
perfectly well founded.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_577"><span class="type-margin"><span>Attempts were also made to regulate profits by fixing prices, and the assize of bread still remains.</span></span>In
 ancient times too it was usual to attempt to regulate the profits of
merchants and other dealers, by rating the price both of provisions and
other goods. The assize of bread is, so far as I know, the only remnant
of this ancient usage. Where there is an exclusive corporation, it may
perhaps be proper to regulate the price of the first necessary of life.
But where there is none, the competition will regulate it much better
than any assize. The method of fixing the assize of bread established by
 the 31st of George II.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt433" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt433_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 could not be put in practice in Scotland, on account of a defect in the
 law; its execution depending upon the office of clerk of the market,
which does not exist there. This defect was not remedied till the 3d of
George III.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt434" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt434_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 The want of an assize occasioned no sensible inconveniency, and the
establishment of one in the few places where it has yet taken place, has
 produced no sensible advantage. In the greater part of the towns of
Scotland, however, there is an incorporation of bakers who claim
exclusive privileges, though they are not very strictly guarded.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_578"><span class="type-margin"><span>The inequalities of wages and profits are not much affected by the advancing or declining state of the society.</span></span>The
 proportion between the different rates both of wages and profit in the
different employments of labour and stock, seems not to be much
affected, as has already been observed,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt435" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt435_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 by the riches or poverty, the advancing, stationary, or declining state
 of the society. Such revolutions in the public welfare, though they
affect the general rates both of wages and profit, must in the end
affect them equally in all different employments. The proportion between
 them, therefore, must remain the same, and cannot well be altered, at
least for any considerable time, by any such revolutions.</p>

<h2 id="lf0206-01_label_488">CHAPTER XI: OF THE RENT OF LAND</h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-01_579">RENT, considered as the price paid for the use of land, is naturally<span class="type-margin"><span>Rent is the produce which is over what is necessary to pay the farmer ordinary profit.</span></span>
 the highest which the tenant can afford to pay in the actual
circumstances of the land. In adjusting the terms of the lease, the
landlord endeavours to leave him no greater share of the produce than
what is sufficient to keep up the stock from which he furnishes the
seed, pays the labour, and purchases and maintains the cattle and other
instruments of husbandry, together with the ordinary profits of farming
stock in the neighbourhood. This is evidently the smallest share with
which the tenant can content himself without being a loser, and the
landlord seldom means to leave him any more. Whatever part of the
produce, or, what is the same thing, whatever part of its price, is over
 and above this share, he naturally endeavours to reserve to himself as
the rent of his land, which is evidently the highest the tenant can
afford to pay in the actual circumstances of the land. Sometimes,
indeed, the liberality, more frequently the ignorance, of the landlord,
makes him accept of somewhat less than this portion; and sometimes too,
though more rarely, the ignorance of the tenant makes him undertake to
pay somewhat more, or to content himself with somewhat less, than the
ordinary profits of farming stock in the neighbourhood. This portion,
however, may still be considered as the natural rent of land, or the
rent for which it is naturally meant that land should for the most part
be let.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_580">The rent of land, it may be thought, is frequently no more than a<span class="type-margin"><span>It is not merely interest on stock laid out in improvements,</span></span>
 reasonable profit or interest for the stock laid out by the landlord
upon its improvement. This, no doubt, may be partly the case upon some
occasions; for it can scarce ever be more than partly the case. The
landlord demands a rent even for unimproved land, and the supposed
interest or profit upon the expence of improvement is generally an
addition to this original rent. Those improvements, besides, are not <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>146<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 always made by the stock of the landlord, but sometimes by that of the
tenant. When the lease comes to be renewed, however, the landlord
commonly demands the same augmentation of rent, as if they had been all
made by his own.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_581"><span class="type-margin"><span>and is sometimes obtained for land incapable of improvement, such as rocks where kelp grows,</span></span>He
 sometimes demands rent for what is altogether incapable of human
improvement. Kelp is a species of sea-weed, which, when burnt, yields an
 alkaline salt, useful for making glass, soap, and for several other
purposes. It grows in several parts of Great Britain, particularly in
Scotland, upon such rocks only as lie within the high water mark, which
are twice every day covered with the sea, and of which the produce,
therefore, was never augmented by human industry. The landlord, however,
 whose estate is bounded by a kelp shore of this kind, demands a rent
for it as much as for his corn fields.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_582"><span class="type-margin"><span>and for the opportunity to fish.</span></span>The
 sea in the neighbourhood of the islands of Shetland is more than
commonly abundant in fish, which make a great part of the subsistence of
 their inhabitants. But in order to profit by the produce of the water,
they must have a habitation upon the neighbouring land. The rent of the
landlord is in proportion, not to what the farmer can make by the land,
but to what he can make both by the land and by<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt436" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt436_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 the water. It is partly paid in sea-fish; and one of the very few
instances in which rent makes a part of the price of that commodity, is
to be found in that country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_583"><span class="type-margin"><span>It is therefore a monopoly price</span></span>The
 rent of land, therefore, considered as the price paid for the use of
the land, is naturally a monopoly price. It is not at all proportioned
to what the landlord may have laid out upon the improvement of the land,
 or to what he can afford to take; but to what the farmer can afford to
give.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_584"><span class="type-margin"><span>Whether particular parts of produce fetch a price sufficient to yield a rent depends on the demand.</span></span>Such
 parts only of the produce of land can commonly be brought to market of
which the ordinary price is sufficient to replace the stock which must
be employed in bringing them thither, together with its ordinary
profits. If the ordinary price is more than this, the surplus part of it
 will naturally go to the rent of the land. If it is not more, though
the commodity may be brought to market, it can afford no rent to the
landlord. Whether the price is, or is not more, depends upon the demand.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_585"><span class="type-margin"><span>Some parts are always in sufficient demand: others sometimes are and sometimes are not.</span></span>There
 are some parts of the produce of land for which the demand must always
be such as to afford a greater price than what is sufficient to bring
them to market; and there are others for which it either may or may not
be such as to afford this greater price. The former must always afford a
 rent to the landlord. The latter sometimes may, and sometimes may not,
according to different circumstances.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>147<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_586">Rent, it is to be observed, therefore, enters into the composition of<span class="type-margin"><span>Wages and profit are causes of price; rent is an effect.</span></span>
 the price of commodities in a different way from wages and profit. High
 or low wages and profit, are the causes of high or low price; high or
low rent is the effect of it. It is because high or low wages and profit
 must be paid, in order to bring a particular commodity to market, that
its price is high or low. But it is because its price is high or low; a
great deal more, or very little more, or no more, than what is
sufficient to pay those wages and profit, that it affords a high rent,
or a low rent, or no rent at all.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_587">The particular consideration, first, of those parts of the produce of<span class="type-margin"><span>The chapter is divided into three parts.</span></span>
 land which always afford some rent; secondly, of those which sometimes
may and sometimes may not afford rent; and, thirdly, of the variations
which, in the different periods of improvement, naturally take place, in
 the relative value of those two different sorts of rude produce, when
compared both with one another and with manufactured commodities, will
divide this chapter into three parts.</p>

 the means of their subsistence, food is always, more or less, in
demand. It can always purchase or command a greater or smaller quantity
of labour, and somebody can always be found who is willing to do
something in order to obtain it. The quantity of labour, indeed, which
it can purchase, is not always equal to what it could maintain, if
managed in the most œconomical manner, on account of the high wages
which are sometimes given to labour. But it can always purchase such a
quantity of labour as it can maintain, according to the rate at which
that sort of labour is commonly maintained in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_589">But land, in almost any situation, produces a greater quantity of<span class="type-margin"><span>Almost all land produces more than enough food to maintain the labour and pay the profits, and therefore yields rent.</span></span>
 food than what is sufficient to maintain all the labour necessary for
bringing it to market, in the most liberal way in which that labour is

replace the stock which employed that labour, together with its profits.
 Something, therefore, always remains for a rent to the landlord.</p>

 of pasture for cattle, of which the milk and the increase are always
more than sufficient, not only to maintain all the labour necessary for
tending them, and to pay the ordinary profit to the farmer or owner of
the herd or flock; but to afford some small rent to the landlord. The
rent increases in proportion to the goodness of the pasture. The same
extent of ground not only maintains a greater number of cattle, but as
they are brought within a smaller compass, less labour becomes requisite
 to tend them, and to collect their produce. The landlord gains both
ways; by the increase of the produce, and by the diminution of the
labour which must be maintained out of it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_591"><span class="type-margin"><span>The rent varies with situation as well as with fertility.</span></span>The rent of land not only varies with its fertility, whatever be its produce, but with its situation, whatever be its fertility.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt437" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt437_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Land in the neighbourhood of a town gives a greater rent than land
equally fertile in a distant part of the country. Though it may cost no
more labour to cultivate the one than the other, it must always cost
more to bring the produce of the distant land to market. A greater
quantity of labour, therefore, must be maintained out of it; and the
surplus, from which are drawn both the profit of the farmer and the rent
 of the landlord, must be diminished. But in remote parts of the country
 the rate of profits, as has already been shown,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt438" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt438_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 is generally higher than in the neighbourhood of a large town. A
smaller proportion of this diminished surplus, therefore, must belong to
 the landlord.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_592"><span class="type-margin"><span>Good roads, etc., diminish differences of rent.</span></span>Good
 roads, canals, and navigable rivers, by diminishing the expence of
carriage, put the remote parts of the country more nearly upon a level
with those in the neighbourhood of the town. They are upon that account
the greatest of all improvements. They encourage the cultivation of the
remote, which must always be the most extensive circle of the country.
They are advantageous to the town, by breaking down the monopoly of the
country in its neighbourhood. They are advantageous even to that part of
 the country. Though they introduce some rival commodities into the old
market, they open many new markets to its produce. Monopoly, besides, is
 a great enemy to good management, which can never be universally
established but in consequence of that free and universal competition
which forces everybody to have recourse to it for the sake of
self-defence. It is not more than fifty years ago, that some of the
counties in the neighbourhood of London petitioned the parliament
against the extension of the turnpike roads into the remoter counties.
Those remoter counties, they pretended, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>149<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 from the cheapness of labour, would be able to sell their grass and
corn cheaper in the London market than themselves, and would thereby
reduce their rents, and ruin their cultivation. Their rents, however,
have risen, and their cultivation has been improved since that time.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_593">A corn field of moderate fertility produces a much greater quantity<span class="type-margin"><span>Corn land yields a larger supply of food after maintaining labour than pasture.</span></span>
 of food for man, than the best pasture of equal extent. Though its
cultivation requires much more labour, yet the surplus which remains
after replacing the seed and maintaining all that labour, is likewise
much greater. If a pound of butcher’s-meat, therefore, was never
supposed to be worth more than a pound of bread, this greater surplus
would every-where be of greater value, and constitute a greater fund
both for the profit of the farmer and the rent of the landlord. It seems
 to have done so universally in the rude beginnings of agriculture.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_594">But the relative values of those two different species of food, bread,<span class="type-margin"><span>In early times meat is cheaper than bread,</span></span>
 and butcher’s-meat, are very different in the different periods of
agriculture. In its rude beginnings, the unimproved wilds, which then
occupy the far greater part of the country, are all abandoned to cattle.
 There is more butcher’s-meat than bread, and bread, therefore, is the
food for which there is the greatest competition, and which consequently
 brings the greatest price. At Buenos Ayres, we are told by Ulloa, four
reals, one-and-twenty pence halfpenny sterling, was, forty or fifty
years ago, the ordinary price of an ox, chosen from a herd of two or
three hundred.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt439" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt439_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 He says nothing of the price of bread, probably because he found
nothing remarkable about it. An ox there, he says, costs little more
than the labour of catching him. But corn can no-where be raised without
 a great deal of labour, and in a country which lies upon the river
Plate, at that time the direct road from Europe to the silver mines of
Potosi, the money price of labour could not be very cheap. It is
otherwise when cultivation is extended over the greater part of the
country. There is then more bread than butcher’s-meat. The competition
changes its direction, and the price of butcher’s-meat becomes greater
than the price of bread.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_595">By the extension besides of cultivation the unimproved wilds become<span class="type-margin"><span>but later on it becomes dearer,</span></span>
 insufficient to supply the demand for butcher’s-meat. A great part of
the cultivated lands must be employed in rearing and fattening cattle,
of which the price, therefore, must be sufficient to pay, not only the
labour necessary for tending them, but the rent which the landlord <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>150<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 and the profit which the farmer could have drawn from such land
employed in tillage. The cattle bred upon the most uncultivated moors,
when brought to the same market, are, in proportion to their weight or
goodness, sold at the same price as those which are reared upon the most
 improved land. The proprietors of those moors profit by it, and raise
the rent of their land in proportion to the price of their cattle. It is
 not more than a century ago that in many parts of the highlands of
Scotland, butcher’s-meat was as cheap or cheaper than even bread made of
 oat-meal. The union opened the market of England to the highland
cattle. Their ordinary price is at present about three times greater
than at the beginning of the century, and the rents of many highland
estates have been tripled and quadrupled in the same time.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt440" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt440_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 In almost every part of Great Britain a pound of the best
butcher’s-meat is, in the present times, generally worth more than two
pounds of the best white bread; and in plentiful years it is sometimes
worth three or four pounds.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_596"><span class="type-margin"><span>and pasture yields as good a rent as corn land,</span></span>It
 is thus that in the progress of improvement the rent and profit of
unimproved pasture come to be regulated in some measure by the rent and
profit of what is improved, and these again by the rent and profit of
corn. Corn is an annual crop. Butcher’s-meat, a crop which requires four
 or five years to grow. As an acre of land, therefore, will produce a
much smaller quantity of the one species of food than of the other, the
inferiority of the quantity must be compensated by the superiority of
the price. If it was more than compensated, more corn land would be
turned into pasture; and if it was not compensated, part of what was in
pasture would be brought back into corn.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_597"><span class="type-margin"><span>and sometimes a greater one,</span></span>This
 equality, however, between the rent and profit of grass and those of
corn; of the land of which the immediate produce is food for cattle, and
 of that of which the immediate produce is food for men; must be
understood to take place only through the greater part of the improved
lands of a great country. In some particular local situations it is
quite otherwise, and the rent and profit of grass are much superior to
what can be made by corn.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_598"><span class="type-margin"><span>as in the neighbourhood of a great town,</span></span>Thus
 in the neighbourhood of a great town, the demand for milk and for
forage to horses, frequently contribute, together with the high price of
 butcher’s-meat, to raise the value of grass above what may be called
its natural proportion to that of corn. This local advantage, it is
evident, cannot be communicated to the lands at a distance.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_599"><span class="type-margin"><span>or all over a populous country which imports corn,</span></span>Particular
 circumstances have sometimes rendered some countries so populous, that
the whole territory, like the lands in the neighbourhood <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>151<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of a great town, has not been sufficient to produce both the grass and
the corn necessary for the subsistence of their inhabitants. Their
lands, therefore, have been principally employed in the production of
grass, the more bulky commodity, and which cannot be so easily brought
from a great distance; and corn, the food of the great body of the
people, has been chiefly imported from foreign countries. Holland is<span class="type-margin"><span>such as Holland and ancient Italy,</span></span>
 at present in this situation, and a considerable part of ancient Italy
seems to have been so during the prosperity of the Romans. To feed well,
 old Cato said, as we are told by Cicero, was the first and most
profitable thing in the management of a private estate; to feed
tolerably well, the second; and to feed ill, the third. To plough, he
ranked only in the fourth place of profit and advantage.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt441" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt441_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Tillage, indeed, in that part of ancient Italy which lay in the
neighbourhood of Rome, must have been very much discouraged by the
distributions of corn which were frequently made to the people, either
gratuitously, or at a very low price. This corn was brought from the
conquered provinces, of which several, instead of taxes, were obliged to
 furnish a tenth part of their produce at a stated price, about sixpence
 a peck, to the republic.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt442" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt442_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 The low price at which this corn was distributed to the people, must
necessarily have sunk the price of what could be brought to the Roman
market from Latium, or the ancient territory of Rome, and must have
discouraged its cultivation in that country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_600">In an open country too, of which the principal produce is corn, a<span class="type-margin"><span>and occasionally in a country where enclosure is unusual.</span></span>
 well-enclosed piece of grass will frequently rent higher than any corn
field in its neighbourhood. It is convenient for the maintenance of the
cattle employed in the cultivation of the corn, and its high rent is, in
 this case, not so properly paid from the value of its own produce, as
from that of the corn lands which are cultivated by means of it. It is
likely to fall, if ever the neighbouring lands are completely enclosed.
The present high rent of enclosed land in Scotland seems owing to the
scarcity of enclosure, and will probably last no longer than that
scarcity. The advantage of enclosure is greater for pasture than for
corn. It saves the labour of guarding the cattle, which feed better too
when they are not liable to be disturbed by their keeper or his dog.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_601">But where there is no local advantage of this kind, the rent and profit<span class="type-margin"><span>Ordinarily the rent of corn land regulates that of pasture.</span></span>
 of corn, or whatever else is the common vegetable food of the people,
must naturally regulate, upon the land which is fit for producing it,
the rent and profit of pasture.</p>

 use of the artificial grasses, of turnips, carrots, cabbages, and the
other expedients which have been fallen upon to make an equal quantity
of land feed a greater number of cattle than when in natural grass,
should somewhat reduce, it might be expected, the superiority which, in
an improved country, the price of butcher’s-meat naturally has over that
 of bread. It seems accordingly to have done so; and there is some
reason for believing that, at least in the London market, the price of
butcher’s-meat in proportion to the price of bread, is a good deal lower
 in the present times than it was in the beginning of the last century.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_603"><span class="type-margin"><span>The price of meat was higher at the beginning of the seventeenth century</span></span>In
 the appendix to the Life of Prince Henry, Doctor Birch has given us an
account of the prices of butcher’s-meat as commonly paid by that prince.
 It is there said that the four quarters of an ox weighing six hundred
pounds usually cost him nine pounds ten shillings, or thereabouts; that
is, thirty-one shillings and eight pence per hundred pounds weight.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt443" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt443_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> Prince Henry died on the 6th of November 1612, in the nineteenth year of his age.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt444" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt444_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_604"><span class="type-margin"><span>than in 1763-4,</span></span>In
 March 1764, there was a parliamentary inquiry into the causes of the
high price of provisions at that time. It was then, among other proof to
 the same purpose, given in evidence by a Virginia merchant, that in
March 1763, he had victualled his ships for twenty-four or twenty-five
shillings the hundred weight of beef, which he considered as the
ordinary price; whereas, in that dear year, he had paid twenty-seven
shillings for the same weight and sort.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt445" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt445_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 This high price in 1764 is, however, four shillings and eight pence
cheaper than the ordinary price paid by prince Henry; and it is the best
 beef only, it must be observed, which is fit to be salted for those
distant voyages.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_605">The price paid by prince Henry amounts to 3⅘<span class="ital">d.</span>
 per pound weight of the whole carcase, coarse and choice pieces taken
together; and at that rate the choice pieces could not have been sold by
 retail for less than 4½<span class="ital">d.</span> or 5<span class="ital">d.</span> the pound.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_606">In the parliamentary inquiry in 1764, the
witnesses stated the price of the choice pieces of the best beef to be
to the consumer 4<span class="ital">d.</span> and 4¼<span class="ital">d.</span> the pound; and the coarse pieces in general to be from seven farthings to 2½<span class="ital">d.</span> and 2¾<span class="ital">d.;</span> and this they said was in general one half-penny dearer than the same sort of pieces had usually been sold in the month <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>153<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of March.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt446" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt446_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 But even this high price is still a good deal cheaper than what we can
well suppose the ordinary retail price to have been in the time of
prince Henry.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_607">During the twelve first years of the last century, the average price<span class="type-margin"><span>whereas wheat was cheaper.</span></span> of the best wheat at the Windsor market was 1<span class="ital">l.</span> 18<span class="ital">s.</span> 3⅙<span class="ital">d.</span> the quarter of nine Winchester bushels.</p>

<p id="Smith_0206-01_610">In all great countries the greater part of the cultivated lands are employed<span class="type-margin"><span>The rent and profit of corn land and pasture regulate those of all other land.</span></span>
 in producing either food for men or food for cattle. The rent and
profit of these regulate the rent and profit of all other cultivated
land. If any particular produce afforded less, the land would soon be
turned into corn or pasture; and if any afforded more, some part of the
lands in corn or pasture would soon be turned to that produce.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_611">Those productions, indeed, which require either a greater original expence<span class="type-margin"><span>The apparently greater rent or profit of some other kinds is only interest on greater expense,</span></span>
 of improvement, or a greater annual expence of cultivation, in order to
 fit the land for them, appear commonly to afford, the one a greater
rent, the other a greater profit than corn or pasture. This superiority,
 however, will seldom be found to amount to more than a reasonable
interest or compensation for this superior expence.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_612">In a hop garden, a fruit garden, a kitchen garden, both the rent of<span class="type-margin"><span>as in hop, and fruit gardens,</span></span>
 the landlord, and the profit of the farmer, are generally greater than
in a corn or grass field. But to bring the ground into this condition
requires more expence. Hence a greater rent becomes due to the landlord.
 It requires too a more attentive and skilful management. Hence a
greater profit becomes due to the farmer. The crop too, at least in the
hop and fruit garden, is more precarious. Its price, therefore, besides
compensating all occasional losses, must afford something like the
profit of insurance.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt448" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt448_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> The circumstances of gardeners, generally mean, and always moderate, may satisfy us that their great ingenuity <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>154<span class="bracket">]</span></span>

so many rich people for amusement, that little advantage is to be made
by those who practise it for profit; because the persons who should
naturally be their best customers, supply themselves with all their most
 precious productions.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_613"><span class="type-margin"><span>kitchen-gardens;</span></span>The
 advantage which the landlord derives from such improvements seems at no
 time to have been greater than what was sufficient to compensate the
original expence of making them. In the ancient husbandry, after the
vineyard, a well-watered kitchen garden seems to have been the part of
the farm which was supposed to yield the most valuable produce. But
Democritus, who wrote upon husbandry about two thousand years ago, and
who was regarded by the ancients as one of the fathers of the art,
thought they did not act wisely who enclosed a kitchen garden. The
profit, he said, would not compensate the expence of a stone wall; and
bricks (he meant, I suppose, bricks baked in the sun) mouldered with the
 rain, and the winter storm, and required continual repairs. Columella,
who reports this judgment of Democritus, does not controvert it, but
proposes a very frugal method of enclosing with a hedge of brambles<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt449" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt449_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> and briars, which, he says, he had found by experience to be both a lasting and an impenetrable fence;<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt450" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt450_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 but which, it seems, was not commonly known in the time of Democritus.
Palladius adopts the opinion of Columella, which had before been
recommended by Varro.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt451" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt451_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 In the judgment of those ancient improvers, the produce of a kitchen
garden had, it seems, been little more than sufficient to pay the
extraordinary culture and the expence of watering; for in countries so
near the sun, it was thought proper, in those times as in the present,
to have the command of a stream of water, which could be conducted to
every bed in the garden. Through the greater part of Europe, a kitchen
garden is not at present supposed to deserve a better enclosure than
that recommended by Columella. In Great Britain, and some other northern
 countries, the finer fruits cannot be brought to perfection but by the
assistance of a wall. Their price, therefore, in such countries, must be
 sufficient to pay the expence of building and maintaining what they
cannot be had without. The fruit-wall frequently surrounds the kitchen
garden, which thus enjoys the benefit of an enclosure which its own
produce could seldom pay for.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>155<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_614">That the vineyard, when properly planted and brought to perfection,<span class="type-margin"><span>and vineyards.</span></span>
 was the most valuable part of the farm, seems to have been an undoubted
 maxim in the ancient agriculture, as it is in the modern through all
the wine countries. But whether it was advantageous to plant a new
vineyard, was a matter of dispute among the ancient Italian husbandmen,
as we learn from Columella. He decides, like a true lover of all curious
 cultivation, in favour of the vineyard, and endeavours to show, by a
comparison of the profit and expence, that it was a most advantageous
improvement.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt452" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt452_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Such comparisons, however, between the profit and expence of new
projects, are commonly very fallacious; and in nothing more so than in
agriculture. Had the gain actually made by such plantations been
commonly as great as he imagined it might have been, there could have
been no dispute about it. The same point is frequently at this day a
matter of controversy in the wine countries. Their writers on
agriculture, indeed, the lovers and promoters of high cultivation, seem
generally disposed to decide with Columella in favour of the vineyard.
In France the anxiety of the proprietors of the old vineyards to prevent
 the planting of any new ones, seems to favour their opinion, and to
indicate a consciousness in those who must have the experience, that
this species of cultivation is at present in that country more
profitable than any other. It seems at the same time, however, to
indicate another opinion, that this superior profit can last no longer
than the laws which at present restrain the free cultivation of the
vine. In 1731, they obtained an order of council, prohibiting both the
planting of new vineyards, and the renewal of those old ones, of which
the cultivation had been interrupted for two years, without a particular
 permission from the king, to be granted only in consequence of an
information from the intendant of the province, certifying that he had
examined the land, and that it was incapable of any other culture. The
pretence of this order was the scarcity of corn and pasture, and the
super-abundance of wine. But had this super-abundance been real, it
would, without any order of council, have effectually prevented the
plantation of new vineyards, by reducing the profits of this species of
cultivation below their natural proportion to those of corn and pasture.
 With regard to the supposed scarcity of corn occasioned by the
multiplication of vineyards, corn is nowhere in France more carefully
cultivated than in the wine provinces, where the land is fit for
producing it; as in Burgundy, Guienne, and the Upper Languedoc. The
numerous hands employed in the one species of cultivation necessarily
encourage the other, by affording a ready market for its produce. To
diminish the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>156<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 number of those who are capable of paying for it, is surely a most
unpromising expedient for encouraging the cultivation of corn. It is
like the policy which would promote agriculture by discouraging
manufactures.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_615">The rent and profit of those productions,
therefore, which require either a greater original expence of
improvement in order to fit the land for them, or a greater annual
expence of cultivation, though often much superior to those of corn and
pasture, yet when they do no more than compensate such extraordinary
expence, are in reality regulated by the rent and profit of those common
 crops.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_616"><span class="type-margin"><span>Land fitted for a particular produce may have a monopoly,</span></span>It
 sometimes happens, indeed, that the quantity of land which can be
fitted for some particular produce, is too small to supply the effectual
 demand. The whole produce can be disposed of to those who are willing
to give somewhat more than what is sufficient to pay the whole rent,
wages and profit necessary for raising and bringing it to market,
according to their natural rates, or according to the rates at which
they are paid in the greater part of other cultivated land. The surplus
part of the price which remains after defraying the whole expence of
improvement and cultivation may commonly, in this case, and in this case
 only, bear no regular proportion to the like surplus in corn or
pasture, but may exceed it in almost any degree; and the greater part of
 this excess naturally goes to the rent of the landlord.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_617"><span class="type-margin"><span>such as that which produces wine of a particular flavour,</span></span>The
 usual and natural proportion, for example, between the rent and profit
of wine and those of corn and pasture, must be understood to take place
only with regard to those vineyards which produce nothing but good
common wine, such as can be raised almost any-where, upon any light,
gravelly, or sandy soil, and which has nothing to recommend it but its
strength and wholesomeness. It is with such vineyards only that the
common land of the country can be brought into competition; for with
those of a peculiar quality it is evident that it cannot.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_618">The vine is more affected by the difference of
 soils than any other fruit tree. From some it derives a flavour which
no culture or management can equal, it is supposed, upon any other. This
 flavour, real or imaginary, is sometimes peculiar to the produce of a
few vineyards; sometimes it extends through the greater part of a small
district, and sometimes through a considerable part of a large province.
 The whole quantity of such wines that is brought to market falls short
of the effectual demand, or the demand of those who would be willing to
pay the whole rent, profit and wages necessary for preparing and
bringing them thither, according to the ordinary rate, or according to
the rate at which they are paid in common vineyards. The whole quantity,
 therefore, can be disposed of to those who are willing to pay more,
which <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>157<span class="bracket">]</span></span> necessarily raises the<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt453" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt453_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 price above that of common wine. The difference is greater or less,
according as the fashionableness and scarcity of the wine render the
competition of the buyers more or less eager. Whatever it be, the
greater part of it goes to the rent of the landlord. For though such
vineyards are in general more carefully cultivated than most others, the
 high price of the wine seems to be, not so much the effect, as the
cause of this careful cultivation. In so valuable a produce the loss
occasioned by negligence is so great as to force even the most careless
to attention. A small part of this high price, therefore, is sufficient
to pay the wages of the extraordinary labour bestowed upon their
cultivation, and the profits of the extraordinary stock which puts that
labour into motion.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_619">The sugar colonies possessed by the European nations in the West<span class="type-margin"><span>or the West Indian sugar colonies,</span></span>
 Indies, may be compared to those precious vineyards. Their whole
produce falls short of the effectual demand of Europe, and can be
disposed of to those who are willing to give more than what is
sufficient to pay the whole rent, profit and wages necessary for
preparing and bringing it to market, according to the rate at which they
 are commonly paid by any other produce. In Cochin-china the finest
white sugar commonly sells for three piastres the quintal, about
thirteen shillings and sixpence of our money, as we are told by Mr.
Poivre,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt454" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt454_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 a very careful observer of the agriculture of that country. What is
there called the quintal weighs from a hundred and fifty to two hundred
Paris pounds, or a hundred and seventy-five Paris pounds at a medium,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt455" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt455_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 which reduces the price of the hundred weight English to about eight
shillings sterling, not a fourth part of what is commonly paid for the
brown or muskavada sugars imported from our colonies, and not a sixth
part of what is paid for the finest white sugar. The greater part of the
 cultivated lands in Cochin-china are employed in producing corn and
rice, the food of the great body of the people. The respective prices of
 corn, rice, and sugar, are there probably in the natural proportion, or
 in that which naturally takes place in the different crops of the
greater part of cultivated land, and which recompences the landlord and
farmer, as nearly as can be computed, according to what is usually the
original expence of improvement and the annual expence of cultivation.
But in our sugar colonies the price of sugar bears no such proportion to
 that of the produce of a <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>158<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 rice or corn field either in Europe or in America. It is commonly said,
 that a sugar planter expects that the rum and the molasses should
defray the whole expence of his cultivation, and that his sugar should
be all clear profit. If this be true, for I pretend not to affirm it, it
 is as if a corn farmer expected to defray the expence of his
cultivation with the chaff and the straw, and that the grain should be
all clear profit. We see frequently societies of merchants in London and
 other trading towns, purchase waste lands in our sugar colonies, which
they expect to improve and cultivate with profit by means of factors and
 agents; notwithstanding the great distance and the uncertain returns,
from the defective administration of justice in those countries. Nobody
will attempt to improve and cultivate in the same manner the most
fertile lands of Scotland, Ireland, or the corn provinces of North
America, though from the more exact administration of justice in these
countries, more regular returns might be expected.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_620"><span class="type-margin"><span>and in a less degree the tobacco plantations of Virginia and Maryland</span></span>In
 Virginia and Maryland the cultivation of tobacco is preferred, as more
profitable, to that of corn. Tobacco might be cultivated with advantage
through the greater part of Europe; but in almost every part of Europe
it has become a principal subject of taxation, and to collect a tax from
 every different farm in the country where this plant might happen to be
 cultivated, would be more difficult, it has been supposed, than to levy
 one upon its importation at the custom-house. The cultivation of
tobacco has upon this account been most absurdly prohibited through the
greater part of Europe,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt456" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt456_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 which necessarily gives a sort of monopoly to the countries where it is
 allowed; and as Virginia and Maryland produce the greatest quantity of
it, they share largely, though with some competitors, in the advantage
of this monopoly. The cultivation of tobacco, however, seems not to be
so advantageous as that of sugar. I have never even heard of any tobacco
 plantation that was improved and cultivated by the capital of merchants
 who <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>159<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 resided in Great Britain, and our tobacco colonies send us home no such
 wealthy planters as we see frequently arrive from our sugar islands.
Though from the preference given in those colonies to the cultivation of
 tobacco above that of corn, it would appear that the effectual demand
of Europe for tobacco is not completely supplied, it probably is more
nearly so than that for sugar: And though the present price of tobacco
is probably more than sufficient to pay the whole rent, wages and profit
 necessary for preparing and bringing it to market, according to the
rate at which they are commonly paid in corn land; it must not be so
much more as the present price of sugar. Our tobacco planters,
accordingly, have shewn the same fear of the super-abundance of tobacco,
 which the proprietors of the old vineyards in France have of the
super-abundance of wine. By act of assembly they have restrained its
cultivation to six thousand plants, supposed to yield a thousand weight
of tobacco, for every negro between sixteen and sixty years of age.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt457" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt457_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> Such a negro, over and above this quantity of tobacco, can manage, they reckon, four acres of Indian corn.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt458" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt458_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> To prevent the market from being overstocked too, they have sometimes, in plentiful years, we are told by Dr. Douglas,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt459" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt459_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 (I suspect he has been ill informed) burnt a certain quantity of
tobacco for every negro, in the same manner as the Dutch are said to do
of spices.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt460" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt460_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 If such violent methods are necessary to keep up the present price of
tobacco, the superior advantage of its culture over that of corn, if it
still has any, will not probably be of long continuance.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_621">It is in this manner that the rent of the cultivated land, of which<span class="type-margin"><span>So the rent of cultivated land producing food regulates that of most of the rest,</span></span>
 the produce is human food, regulates the rent of the greater part of
other cultivated land. No particular produce can long afford less;
because the land would immediately be turned to another use: And if any
particular produce commonly affords more, it is because the quantity of
land which can be fitted for it is too small to supply the effectual
demand.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_622">In Europe corn is the principal produce of land which serves<span class="type-margin"><span>and in Europe the rent of corn</span></span> immediately for human food. Except in particular situations, therefore, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>160<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 the rent of corn land regulates in Europe that of all other cultivated
land. Britain need envy neither the vineyards of France nor the olive
plantations of Italy. Except in particular situations, the value of
these is regulated by that of corn, in which the fertility of Britain is
 not much inferior to that of either of those two countries.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_623"><span class="type-margin"><span>If the common food was such as to produce a greater surplus, rent would be higher</span></span>If
 in any country the common and favourite vegetable food of the people
should be drawn from a plant of which the most common land, with the
same or nearly the same culture, produced a much greater quantity than
the most fertile does of corn, the rent of the landlord, or the surplus
quantity of food which would remain to him, after paying the labour and
replacing the stock of the farmer together with its ordinary profits,
would necessarily be much greater. Whatever was the rate at which labour
 was commonly maintained in that country, this greater surplus could
always maintain a greater quantity of it, and consequently enable the
landlord to purchase or command a greater quantity of it. The real value
 of his rent, his real power and authority, his command of the
necessaries and conveniencies of life with which the labour of other
people could supply him, would necessarily be much greater.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_624"><span class="type-margin"><span>for example, rice,</span></span>A
 rice field produces a much greater quantity of food than the most
fertile corn field. Two crops in the year from thirty to sixty bushels
each, are said to be the ordinary produce of an acre. Though its
cultivation, therefore, requires more labour, a much greater surplus
remains after maintaining all that labour. In those rice countries,
therefore, where rice is the common and favourite vegetable food of the
people, and where the cultivators are chiefly maintained with it, a
greater share of this greater surplus should belong to the landlord than
 in corn countries. In Carolina, where the planters, as in other British
 colonies, are generally both farmers and landlords, and where rent
consequently is confounded with profit, the cultivation of rice is found
 to be more profitable than that of corn, though their fields produce
only one crop in the year, and though, from the prevalence of the
customs of Europe, rice is not there the common and favourite vegetable
food of the people.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_625">A good rice field is a bog at all seasons, and
 at one season a bog covered with water. It is unfit either for corn, or
 pasture, or vineyard, or, indeed, for any other vegetable produce that
is very useful to men: And the lands which are fit for those purposes,
are not fit for rice. Even in the rice countries, therefore, the rent of
 rice lands cannot regulate the rent of the other cultivated land which
can never be turned to that produce.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>161<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_626">The food produced by a field of potatoes is not inferior in quantity<span class="type-margin"><span>or potatoes.</span></span>
 to that produced by a field of rice, and much superior to what is
produced by a field of wheat. Twelve thousand weight of potatoes from an
 acre of land is not a greater produce than two thousand weight of
wheat. The food or solid nourishment, indeed, which can be drawn from
each of those two plants, is not altogether in proportion to their
weight, on account of the watery nature of potatoes. Allowing, however,
half the weight of this root to go to water, a very large allowance,
such an acre of potatoes will still produce six thousand weight of solid
 nourishment, three times the quantity produced by the acre of wheat. An
 acre of potatoes is cultivated with less expence than an acre of wheat;
 the fallow, which generally precedes the sowing of wheat, more than
compensating the hoeing and other extraordinary culture which is always
given to potatoes. Should this root ever become in any part of Europe,
like rice in some rice countries, the common and favourite vegetable
food of the people, so as to occupy the same proportion of the lands in
tillage which wheat and other sorts of grain for human food do at
present, the same quantity of cultivated land would maintain a much
greater number of people, and the labourers being generally fed with
potatoes, a greater surplus would remain after replacing all the stock
and maintaining all the labour employed in cultivation. A greater share
of this surplus too would belong to the landlord. Population would
increase, and rents would rise much beyond what they are at present.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_627">The land which is fit for potatoes, is fit for
 almost every other useful vegetable. If they occupied the same
proportion of cultivated land which corn does at present, they would
regulate, in the same manner, the rent of the greater part of other
cultivated land.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_628">In some parts of Lancashire it is pretended, I have been told, that<span class="type-margin"><span>Wheat is probably a better food than oats,</span></span>
 bread of oatmeal is a heartier food for labouring people than wheaten
bread, and I have frequently heard the same doctrine held in Scotland. I
 am, however, somewhat doubtful of the truth of it. The common people in
 Scotland, who are fed with oatmeal, are in general neither so strong
nor so handsome as the same rank of people in England, who are fed with
wheaten bread. They neither work so well, nor look so well; and as there
 is not the same difference between the people of fashion in the two
countries, experience would seem to show, that the food of the common
people in Scotland is not so suitable to the human constitution as that
of their neighbours of the same rank in England.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt461" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt461_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> But it<span class="type-margin"><span>but not than potatoes,</span></span> seems to be otherwise with potatoes. The chairmen, porters, and coalheavers <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>162<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 in London, and those unfortunate women who live by prostitution, the
strongest men and the most beautiful women perhaps in the British
dominions, are said to be, the greater part of them, from the lowest
rank of people in Ireland, who are generally fed with this root. No food
 can afford a more decisive proof of its nourishing quality, or of its
being peculiarly suitable to the health of the human constitution.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_629"><span class="type-margin"><span>Potatoes, however, are perishable.</span></span>It
 is difficult to preserve potatoes through the year, and impossible to
store them like corn, for two or three years together. The fear of not
being able to sell them before they rot, discourages their cultivation,
and is, perhaps, the chief obstacle to their ever becoming in any great
country, like bread, the principal vegetable food of all the different
ranks of the people.</p>

<h2 id="lf0206-01_label_516">PART II: <span class="ital">Of the Produce of Land which sometimes does, and sometimes does not, afford Rent</span></h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-01_630">HUMAN food seems to be the
only produce of land which always and necessarily affords some rent to
the landlord. Other sorts of produce sometimes may and sometimes may
not, according to different circumstances.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_631"><span class="type-margin"><span>The materials of clothing and lodging, at first super-abundant, come in time to afford a rent</span></span>After food, cloathing and lodging are the two great wants of mankind.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_632">Land in its original rude state can afford the
 materials of cloathing and lodging to a much greater number of people
than it can feed. In its improved state it can sometimes feed a greater
number of people than it can supply with those materials; at least in
the way in which they require them, and are willing to pay for them. In
the one state, therefore, there is always a super-abundance of those
materials, which are frequently, upon that account, of little or no
value. In the other there is often a scarcity, which necessarily
augments their value. In the one state a great part of them is thrown
away as useless, and the price of what is used is considered as equal
only to the labour and expence of fitting it for use, and can,
therefore, afford no rent to the landlord. In the other they are all
made use of, and there is frequently a demand for more than can be had.
Somebody is always<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt462" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt462_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 willing to give more for every part of them than what is sufficient to
pay the expence of bringing them to market. Their price, therefore, can
always afford some rent to the landlord.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>163<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_633">The skins of the larger animals were the original materials of cloathing.<span class="type-margin"><span>For example, hides and wool,</span></span>
 Among nations of hunters and shepherds, therefore, whose food consists
chiefly in the flesh of those animals, every man, by providing himself
with food, provides himself with the materials of more cloathing than he
 can wear. If there was no foreign commerce, the greater part of them
would be thrown away as things of no value. This was probably the case
among the hunting nations of North America, before their country was
discovered by the Europeans, with whom they now exchange their surplus
peltry, for blankets, fire-arms, and brandy, which gives it some value.
In the present commercial state of the known world, the most barbarous
nations, I believe, among whom land property is established, have some
foreign commerce of this kind, and find among their wealthier neighbours
 such a demand for all the materials of cloathing, which their land
produces, and which can neither be wrought up nor consumed at home, as
raises their price above what it costs to send them to those wealthier
neighbours.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt463" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt463_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 It affords, therefore, some rent to the landlord. When the greater part
 of the highland cattle were consumed on their own hills, the
exportation of their hides made the most considerable article of the
commerce of that country, and what they were exchanged for afforded some
 addition to the rent of the highland estates.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt464" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt464_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 The wool of England, which in old times could neither be consumed nor
wrought up at home, found a market in the then wealthier and more
industrious country of Flanders, and its price afforded something to the
 rent of the land which produced it. In countries not better cultivated
than England was then, or than the highlands of Scotland are now, and
which had no foreign commerce, the materials of cloathing would
evidently be so super-abundant, that a great part of them would be
thrown away as useless, and no part could afford any rent to the
landlord.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_634">The materials of lodging cannot always be transported to so great a<span class="type-margin"><span>stone and timber.</span></span>
 distance as those of cloathing, and do not so readily become an object
of foreign commerce. When they are super-abundant in the country which
produces them, it frequently happens, even in the present commercial
state of the world, that they are of no value to the landlord. A good
stone quarry in the neighbourhood of London would afford a considerable
rent. In many parts of Scotland and Wales it affords none. Barren timber
 for building is of great value in a populous and well-cultivated
country, and the land which produces it affords a considerable rent. But
 in many parts of North America the landlord would be much obliged to
any body who would carry away the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>164<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 greater part of his large trees. In some parts of the highlands of
Scotland the bark is the only part of the wood which, for want of roads
and water-carriage, can be sent to market. The timber is left to rot
upon the ground. When the materials of lodging are so super-abundant,
the part made use of is worth only the labour and expence of fitting it
for that use. It affords no rent to the landlord, who generally grants
the use of it to whoever takes the trouble of asking it. The demand of
wealthier nations, however, sometimes enables him to get a rent for it.
The paving of the streets of London has enabled the owners of some
barren rocks on the coast of Scotland to draw a rent from what never
afforded any before. The woods of Norway and of the coasts of the
Baltic, find a market in many parts of Great Britain which they could
not find at home, and thereby afford some rent to their proprietors.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_635"><span class="type-margin"><span>Population depends on food:</span></span>Countries
 are populous, not in proportion to the number of people whom their
produce can cloath and lodge, but in proportion to that of those whom it
 can feed. When food is provided, it is easy to find the necessary
cloathing and lodging. But though these are at hand, it may often be
difficult to find food. In some parts even of the British dominions what
 is called A House, may be built by one day’s labour of one man. The
simplest species of cloathing, the skins of animals, require somewhat
more labour to dress and prepare them for use. They do not, however,
require a great deal. Among savage and barbarous nations, a hundredth or
 little more than a hundredth part of the labour of the whole year, will
 be sufficient to provide them with such cloathing and lodging as
satisfy the greater part of the people. All the other ninety-nine parts
are frequently no more than enough to provide them with food.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_636"><span class="type-margin"><span>so the demand for the materials of clothing and lodging is increased by greater case of obtaining food,</span></span>But
 when by the improvement and cultivation of land the labour of one
family can provide food for two, the labour of half the society becomes
sufficient to provide food for the whole. The other half, therefore, or
at least the greater part of them, can be employed in providing other
things, or in satisfying the other wants and fancies of mankind.
Cloathing and lodging, houshold furniture, and what is called Equipage,
are the principal objects of the greater part of those wants and
fancies. The rich man consumes no more food than his poor neighbour. In
quality it may be very different, and to select and prepare it may
require more labour and art; but in quantity it is very nearly the same.
 But compare the spacious palace and great wardrobe of the one, with the
 hovel and the few rags of the other, and you will be sensible that the
difference between their cloathing, lodging, and <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>165<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 houshold furniture, is almost as great in quantity as it is in quality.
 The desire of food is limited in every man by the narrow capacity of
the human stomach; but the desire of the conveniencies and ornaments of
building, dress, equipage, and houshold furniture, seems to have no
limit or certain boundary. Those, therefore, who have the command of
more food than they themselves can consume, are always willing to
exchange the surplus, or, what is the same thing, the price of it, for
gratifications of this other kind. What is over and above satisfying the
 limited desire, is given for the amusement of those desires which
cannot be satisfied, but seem to be altogether endless. The poor, in
order to obtain food, exert themselves to gratify those fancies of the
rich, and to obtain it more certainly, they vie with one another in the
cheapness and perfection of their work. The number of workmen increases
with the increasing quantity of food, or with the growing improvement
and cultivation of the lands; and as the nature of their business admits
 of the utmost subdivisions of labour, the quantity of materials which
they can work up, increases in a much greater proportion than their
numbers. Hence arises a demand for every sort of material which human
invention can employ, either usefully or ornamentally, in building,
dress, equipage, or houshold furniture; for the fossils and minerals
contained in the bowels of the earth, the precious metals, and the
precious stones.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_637">Food is in this manner, not only the original source of rent, but every<span class="type-margin"><span>which thus makes them afford rent.</span></span>
 other part of the produce of land which afterwards affords rent,
derives that part of its value from the improvement of the powers of
labour in producing food by means of the improvement and cultivation of
land.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt465" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt465_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_638">Those other parts of the produce of land, however, which afterwards<span class="type-margin"><span>They do not, however, even then always afford rent:</span></span>
 afford rent, do not afford it always. Even in improved and cultivated
countries, the demand for them is not always such as to afford a greater
 price than what is sufficient to pay the labour, and replace, together
with its ordinary profits, the stock which must be employed in bringing
them to market. Whether it is or is not such, depends upon different
circumstances.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_639">Whether a coal-mine, for example, can afford any rent, depends<span class="type-margin"><span>for example, some coal-mines are too barren to afford rent,</span></span> partly upon its fertility, and partly upon its situation.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_640">A mine of any kind may be said to be either
fertile or barren, according as the quantity of mineral which can be
brought from it by a certain quantity of labour, is greater or less than
 what can be brought by an equal quantity from the greater part of other
 mines of the same kind.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>166<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_641">Some coal-mines advantageously situated,
cannot be wrought on account of their barrenness. The produce does not
pay the expence. They can afford neither profit nor rent.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_642">There are some of which the produce is barely sufficient to pay the labour,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt466" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt466_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 and replace, together with its ordinary profits, the stock employed in
working them. They afford some profit to the undertaker of the work, but
 no rent to the landlord. They can be wrought advantageously by nobody
but the landlord, who being himself undertaker of the work, gets the
ordinary profit of the capital which he employs in it. Many coal-mines
in Scotland are wrought in this manner, and can be wrought in no other.
The landlord will allow nobody else to work them without paying some
rent, and nobody can afford to pay any.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_643"><span class="type-margin"><span>or too disadvantageously situated.</span></span>Other
 coal-mines in the same country sufficiently fertile, cannot be wrought
on account of their situation. A quantity of mineral sufficient to
defray the expence of working, could be brought from the mine by the
ordinary, or even less than the ordinary quantity of labour: But in an
inland country, thinly inhabited, and without either good roads or
water-carriage, this quantity could not be sold.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_644"><span class="type-margin"><span>The price of coal is kept down by that of wood,</span></span>Coals
 are a less agreeable fewel than wood: they are said too to be less
wholesome. The expence of coals, therefore, at the place where they are
consumed, must generally be somewhat less than that of wood.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_645"><span class="type-margin"><span>which varies with the state of agriculture</span></span>The
 price of wood again varies with the state of agriculture, nearly in the
 same manner, and exactly for the same reason, as the price of cattle.
In its rude beginnings the greater part of every country is covered with
 wood, which is then a mere incumbrance of no value to the landlord, who
 would gladly give it to any body for the cutting. As agriculture
advances, the woods are partly cleared by the progress of tillage, and
partly go to decay in consequence of the increased number of cattle.
These, though they do not increase in the same proportion as corn, which
 is altogether the acquisition of human industry, yet multiply under the
 care and protection of men; who store up in the season of plenty what
may maintain them in that of scarcity, who through the whole year
furnish them with a greater quantity of food than uncultivated nature
provides for them, and who by destroying and extirpating their enemies,
secure them in the free enjoyment of all that she provides. Numerous
herds of cattle, when allowed to wander through the woods, though they
do not destroy the old trees, hinder any young ones from coming up, so
that in the course of a century or two the whole forest goes to ruin.
The scarcity of wood then raises its <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>167<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 price. It affords a good rent, and the landlord sometimes finds that he
 can scarce employ his best lands more advantageously than in growing
barren timber, of which the greatness of the profit often compensates
the lateness of the returns. This seems in the present times to be
nearly the state of things in several parts of Great Britain, where the
profit of planting is found to be equal to that of either corn or
pasture. The advantage which the landlord derives from planting, can
no-where exceed, at least for any considerable time, the rent which
these could afford him; and in an inland country which is highly
cultivated, it will frequently not fall much short of this rent. Upon
the sea-coast of a well-improved country, indeed, if coals can
conveniently be had for fewel,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt467" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt467_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 it may sometimes be cheaper to bring barren timber for building from
less cultivated foreign countries, than to raise it at home. In the new
town of Edinburgh, built within these few years,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt468" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt468_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> there is not, perhaps, a single stick of Scotch timber.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_646">Whatever may be the price of wood, if that of coals is such that the<span class="type-margin"><span>But in the coal countries coal is everywhere much below this price.</span></span>
 expence of a coal-fire is nearly equal to that of a wood one, we may be
 assured, that at that place, and in these circumstances, the price of
coals is as high as it can be. It seems to be so in some of the inland
parts of England, particularly in Oxfordshire, where it is usual, even
in the fires of the common people, to mix coals and wood together, and
where the difference in the expence of those two sorts of fewel cannot,
therefore, be very great.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_647">Coals, in the coal countries, are every-where
much below this highest price. If they were not, they could not bear the
 expence of a distant carriage, either by land or by water. A small
quantity only could be sold, and the coal masters and coal proprietors
find it more for their interest to sell a great quantity at a price
somewhat above the lowest, than a small quantity at the highest. The
most fertile coal-mine too, regulates the price of coals at all the
other mines in its neighbourhood.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt469" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt469_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 Both the proprietor and the undertaker of the work find, the one that
he can get a greater rent, the other that he can get a greater profit,
by somewhat underselling all their neighbours. Their neighbours are soon
 obliged to sell at the same price, though they cannot so well <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>168<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 afford it, and though it always diminishes, and sometimes takes away
altogether both their rent and their profit. Some works are abandoned
altogether; others can afford no rent, and can be wrought only by the
proprietor.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_648"><span class="type-margin"><span>The lowest possible price is that which only replaces stock with profits.</span></span>The
 lowest price at which coals can be sold for any considerable time, is,
like that of all other commodities, the price which is barely sufficient
 to replace, together with its ordinary profits, the stock which must be
 employed in bringing them to market. At a coal-mine for which the
landlord can get no rent, but which he must either work himself or let
it alone altogether, the price of coals must generally be nearly about
this price.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_649"><span class="type-margin"><span>Rent forms a smaller proportion of the price of coal than of that of most other rude produce.</span></span>Rent,
 even where coals afford one, has generally a smaller share in their
price than in that of most other parts of the rude produce of land. The
rent of an estate above ground, commonly amounts to what is supposed to
be a third of the gross produce; and it is generally a rent certain and
independent of the occasional variations in the crop. In coal-mines a
fifth of the gross produce is a very great rent; a tenth the common
rent, and it is seldom a rent certain, but depends upon the occasional
variations in the produce. These are so great, that in a country where
thirty years purchase is considered as a moderate price for the property
 for a landed estate, ten years purchase is regarded as a good price for
 that of a coal-mine.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_650"><span class="type-margin"><span>The situation of a metallic mine is less important than that of a coal mine,</span></span>The value of a coal-mine to the proprietor frequently depends<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt470" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt470_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 as much upon its situation as upon its fertility. That of a metallic
mine depends more upon its fertility, and less upon its situation. The
coarse, and still more the precious metals, when separated from the ore,
 are so valuable that they can generally bear the expence of a very long
 land, and of the most distant sea carriage. Their market is not
confined to the countries in the neighbourhood of the mine, but extends
to the whole world. The copper of Japan makes an article of commerce in
Europe;<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt471" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt471_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> the iron of Spain in that of Chili and Peru. The silver of Peru finds its way, not only to Europe, but from Europe to China.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_651"><span class="type-margin"><span>metals from all parts of the world being brought into competition</span></span>The
 price of coals in Westmorland or Shropshire can have little effect on
their price at Newcastle; and their price in the Lionnois can have none
at all. The productions of such distant coal-mines can never be brought
into competition with one another. But the productions of the most
distant metallic mines frequently may, and in fact commonly are. The
price, therefore, of the coarse, and still more that of the precious
metals, at the most fertile mines in the world, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>169<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 must necessarily more or less affect their price at every other in it.
The price of copper in Japan must have some influence upon its price at
the copper mines in Europe. The price of silver in Peru, or the quantity
 either of labour or of other goods which it will purchase there, must
have some influence on its price, not only at the silver mines of
Europe, but at those of China. After the discovery of the mines of Peru,
 the silver mines of Europe were, the greater part of them, abandoned.
The value of silver was so much reduced that their produce could no
longer pay the expence of working them, or replace, with a profit, the
food, cloaths, lodging and other necessaries which were consumed in that
 operation. This was the case too with the mines of Cuba and St.
Domingo, and even with the ancient mines of Peru, after the discovery of
 those of Potosi.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_652">The price of every metal at every mine, therefore, being regulated<span class="type-margin"><span>Rent has therefore a small share in the price of metals.</span></span>
 in some measure by its price at the most fertile mine in the world that
 is actually wrought, it can at the greater part of mines do very little
 more than pay the expence of working, and can seldom afford a very high
 rent to the landlord. Rent, accordingly, seems at the greater part of
mines to have but a small share in the price of the coarse, and a still
smaller in that of the precious metals. Labour and profit make up the
greater part of both.</p>

 of the tin mines of Cornwall, the most fertile that are known in the
world, as we are told by the Rev. Mr. Borlace, vice-warden of the
stannaries. Some, he says, afford more, and some do not afford so much.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt472" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt472_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> A sixth part of the gross produce is the rent too of several very fertile lead mines in Scotland.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_654">In the silver mines of Peru, we are told by Frezier and Ulloa, the<span class="type-margin"><span>The silver mines of Peru formerly paid a fifth,</span></span>
 proprietor frequently exacts no other acknowledgment from the
undertaker of the mine, but that he will grind the ore at his mill,
paying him the ordinary multure or price of grinding.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt473" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt473_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 Till 1736, indeed, the tax of the king of Spain amounted to one-fifth
of the standard silver, which till then might be considered as the real
rent of the greater part of the silver mines of Peru, the richest which
have been known in the world. If there had been no tax, this fifth would
 <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>170<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 naturally have belonged to the landlord, and many mines might have been
 wrought which could not then be wrought, because they could not afford
this tax.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt474" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt474_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> The tax of the duke of Cornwall upon tin is supposed to amount to more than five per cent. or one-twentieth part of the value;<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt475" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt475_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 and whatever may be his proportion, it would naturally too belong to
the proprietor of the mine, if tin was duty free. But if you add
one-twentieth to one-sixth, you will find that the whole average rent of
 the tin mines of Cornwall, was<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt476" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt476_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> to the whole average<span class="type-margin"><span>and now only a tenth,</span></span>
 rent of the silver mines of Peru, as thirteen to twelve. But the silver
 mines of Peru are not now able to pay even this low rent, and the tax
upon silver was, in 1736, reduced from one-fifth to one-tenth.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt477" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt477_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 Even this tax upon silver too gives more temptation to smuggling than
the tax of one-twentieth upon tin; and smuggling must be much easier in
the precious than in the bulky commodity. The tax of the king of Spain
accordingly is said to be very ill paid, and that of the duke of
Cornwall very well. Rent, therefore, it is probable, makes a greater
part of the price of tin at the most fertile tin mines, than it does of
silver at the most fertile silver mines in the world. After replacing
the stock employed in working those different mines, together with its
ordinary profits, the residue which remains to the proprietor, is
greater it seems in the coarse, than in the precious metal.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_655"><span class="type-margin"><span>while profits are small</span></span>Neither
 are the profits of the undertakers of silver mines commonly very great
in Peru. The same most respectable and well informed authors acquaint
us, that when any person undertakes to work a new mine in Peru, he is
universally looked upon as a man destined to bankruptcy and ruin, and is
 upon that account shunned and avoided by every body.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt478" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt478_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a> Mining, it seems, is considered there in the same light as here, as a lottery, in which the prizes do not compensate the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>171<span class="bracket">]</span></span> blanks, though the greatness of some tempts many adventurers to throw away their fortunes in such unprosperous projects.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_656">As the sovereign, however, derives a considerable part of his revenue<span class="type-margin"><span>Mining is encouraged in Peru by the interest of the sovereign</span></span>
 from the produce of silver mines, the law in Peru gives every possible
encouragement to the discovery and working of new ones. Whoever
discovers a new mine, is entitled to measure off two hundred and
forty-six feet in length, according to what he supposes to be the
direction of the vein, and half as much in breadth.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt479" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt479_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 He becomes proprietor of this portion of the mine, and can work it
without paying any acknowledgment to the landlord. The interest of the
duke of Cornwall has given occasion to a regulation nearly of the same
kind in that ancient dutchy. In waste and uninclosed lands any person
who discovers a tin mine, may mark out its limits to a certain extent,
which is called bounding a mine. The bounder becomes the real proprietor
 of the mine, and may either work it himself, or give it in lease to
another, without the consent of the owner of the land, to whom, however,
 a very small acknowledgment must be paid upon working it.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt480" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt480_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> In both regulations the sacred rights of private property are sacrificed to the supposed interests of public revenue.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_657">The same encouragement is given in Peru to the discovery and<span class="type-margin"><span>The gold mines of Peru now pay only a twentieth in rent.</span></span>
 working of new gold mines; and in gold the king’s tax amounts only to a
 twentieth part of the standard metal. It was once a fifth, and
afterwards a tenth, as in silver; but it was found that the work could
not bear even the lowest of these two taxes.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt481" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt481_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 If it is rare, however, say the same authors, Frezier and Ulloa, to
find a person who has made his fortune by a silver, it is still much
rarer to find one who has done so by a gold mine.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt482" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt482_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 This twentieth part seems to be the whole rent which is paid by the
greater part of the gold mines in Chili and Peru. Gold too is much more
liable to be smuggled than even silver; not only on account of the
superior value of the metal in proportion to its bulk, but on account of
 the peculiar way in which nature produces <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>172<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 it. Silver is very seldom found virgin, but, like most other metals, is
 generally mineralized with some other body, from which it is impossible
 to separate it in such quantities as will pay for the expence, but by a
 very laborious and tedious operation, which cannot well be carried on
but in workhouses erected for the purpose, and therefore exposed to the
inspection of the king’s officers. Gold, on the contrary, is almost
always found virgin. It is sometimes found in pieces of some bulk; and
even when mixed in small and almost insensible particles with sand,
earth, and other extraneous bodies, it can be separated from them by a
very short and simple operation, which can be carried on in any private
house by any body who is possessed of a small quantity of mercury. If
the king’s tax, therefore, is but ill paid upon silver, it is likely to
be much worse paid upon gold; and rent must make a much smaller part of
the price of gold, than even of that of silver.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_658"><span class="type-margin"><span>The lowest price of the precious metals must replace stock with ordinary profits,</span></span>The
 lowest price at which the precious metals can be sold, or the smallest
quantity of other goods for which they can be exchanged during any
considerable time, is regulated by the same principles which fix the
lowest ordinary price of all other goods. The stock which must commonly
be employed, the food, cloaths, and lodging which must commonly be
consumed in bringing them from the mine to the market, determine it. It
must at least be sufficient to replace that stock, with the ordinary
profits.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_659"><span class="type-margin"><span>but their highest price is determined by their scarcity.</span></span>Their
 highest price, however, seems not to be necessarily determined by any
thing but the actual scarcity or plenty of those metals themselves. It
is not determined by that of any other commodity, in the same manner as
the price of coals is by that of wood, beyond which no scarcity can ever
 raise it. Increase the scarcity of gold to a certain degree, and the
smallest bit of it may become more precious than a diamond, and exchange
 for a greater quantity of other goods.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_660"><span class="type-margin"><span>The demand for them arises from their utility and beauty:</span></span>The
 demand for those metals arises partly from their utility, and partly
from their beauty. If you except iron, they are more useful than,
perhaps, any other metal. As they are less liable to rust and impurity,
they can more easily be kept clean; and the utensils either of the table
 or the kitchen are often upon that account more agreeable when made of
them. A silver boiler is more cleanly that a lead, copper, or tin one;
and the same quality would render a gold boiler still better than a
silver one. Their principal merit, however, arises<span class="type-margin"><span>and the merit of beauty is enhanced by their scarcity.</span></span>
 from their beauty, which renders them peculiarly fit for the ornaments
of dress and furniture. No paint or dye can give so splendid a colour as
 gilding. The merit of their beauty is greatly enhanced by their <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>173<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 scarcity. With the greater part of rich people, the chief enjoyment of
riches consists in the parade of riches, which in their eye is never so
complete as when they appear to possess those decisive marks of opulence
 which nobody can possess but themselves. In their eyes the merit of an
object which is in any degree either useful or beautiful, is greatly
enhanced by its scarcity, or by the great labour which it requires to
collect any considerable quantity of it, a labour which nobody can
afford to pay but themselves. Such objects they are willing to purchase
at a higher price than things much more beautiful and useful, but more
common. These qualities of utility, beauty, and scarcity, are the
original foundation of the high price of those metals, or of the great
quantity of other goods for which they can every-where be exchanged.
This value was antecedent to and independent of their being employed as
coin, and was the quality which fitted them for that employment. That
employment, however, by occasioning a new demand, and by diminishing the
 quantity which could be employed in any other way, may have afterwards
contributed to keep up or increase their value.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_661">The demand for the precious stones arises altogether from their<span class="type-margin"><span>The demand for precious stones arises altogether from their beauty enhanced by their scarcity.</span></span>
 beauty. They are of no use, but as ornaments; and the merit of their
beauty is greatly enhanced by their scarcity, or by the difficulty and
expence of getting them from the mine. Wages and profit accordingly make
 up, upon most occasions, almost the whole of their high price. Rent
comes in but for a very small share; frequently for no share; and the
most fertile mines only afford any considerable rent. When Tavernier, a
jeweller, visited the diamond mines of Golconda and Visiapour, he was
informed that the sovereign of the country, for whose benefit they were
wrought, had ordered all of them to be shut up, except those which
yielded the largest and finest stones.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt483" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt483_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> The others, it seems, were to the proprietor not worth the working.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_662">As the price both of the precious metals and of the precious stones<span class="type-margin"><span>The rent of mines of precious metals and precious stones is in proportion to their relative and not to their absolute fertility.</span></span>
 is regulated all over the world by their price at the most fertile mine
 in it, the rent which a mine of either can afford to its proprietor is
in proportion, not to its absolute, but to what may be called its
relative fertility, or to its superiority over other mines of the same
kind. If <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>174<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 new mines were discovered as much superior to those of Potosi as they
were superior to those of Europe, the value of silver might be so much
degraded as to render even the mines of Potosi not worth the working.
Before the discovery of the Spanish West Indies, the most fertile mines
in Europe may have afforded as great a rent to their proprietor as the
richest mines in Peru do at present. Though the quantity of silver was
much less, it might have exchanged for an equal quantity of other goods,
 and the proprietor’s share might have enabled him to purchase or
command an equal quantity either of labour or of commodities. The value
both of the produce and of the rent, the real revenue which they
afforded both to the public and to the proprietor, might have been the
same.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_663"><span class="type-margin"><span>Abundant supplies would add little to the wealth of the world</span></span>The
 most abundant mines either of the precious metals or of the precious
stones could add little to the wealth of the world. A produce of which
the value is principally derived from its scarcity, is necessarily
degraded by its abundance. A service of plate, and the other frivolous
ornaments of dress and furniture, could be purchased for a smaller
quantity of labour, or for a smaller quantity of commodities; and in
this would consist the sole advantage which the world could derive from
that abundance.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_664"><span class="type-margin"><span>But in estates above ground both produce and rent are regulated by absolute fertility.</span></span>It
 is otherwise in estates above ground. The value both of their produce
and of their rent is in proportion to their absolute, and not to their
relative fertility. The land which produces a certain quantity of food,
cloaths, and lodging, can always feed, cloath, and lodge a certain
number of people; and whatever may be the proportion of the landlord, it
 will always give him a proportionable command of the labour of those
people, and of the commodities with which that labour can supply him.
The value of the most barren lands is not diminished by the
neighbourhood of the most fertile. On the contrary, it is generally
increased by it. The great number of people maintained by the fertile
lands afford a market to many parts of the produce of the barren, which
they could never have found among those whom their own produce could
maintain.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_665"><span class="type-margin"><span>Abundance of food raises the value of other produce.</span></span>Whatever
 increases the fertility of land in producing food, increases not only
the value of the lands upon which the improvement is bestowed, but
contributes likewise to increase that of many other lands, by creating a
 new demand for their produce. That abundance of food, of which, in
consequence of the improvement of land, many people have the disposal
beyond what they themselves can consume, is the great cause of the
demand both for the precious metals and the precious stones, as well as
for every other conveniency and ornament <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>175<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of dress, lodging, houshold furniture, and equipage. Food not only
constitutes the principal part of the riches of the world, but it is the
 abundance of food which gives the principal part of their value to many
 other sorts of riches. The poor inhabitants of Cuba and St. Domingo,
when they were first discovered by the Spaniards, used to wear little
bits of gold as ornaments in their hair and other parts of their dress.
They seemed to value them as we would do any little pebbles of somewhat
more than ordinary beauty, and to consider them as just worth the
picking up, but not worth the refusing to any body who asked them. They
gave them to their new guests at the first request, without seeming to
think that they had made them any very valuable present. They were
astonished to observe the rage of the Spaniards to obtain them; and had
no notion that there could anywhere be a country in which many people
had the disposal of so great a superfluity of food, so scanty always
among themselves, that for a very small quantity of those glittering
baubles they would willingly give as much as might maintain a whole
family for many years. Could they have been made to understand this, the
 passion of the Spaniards would not have surprised them.</p>

<h2 id="lf0206-01_label_539">PART III: <span class="ital">Of the
Variations in the Proportion between the respective Values of that Sort
of Produce which always affords Rent, and of that which sometimes does
and sometimes does not afford Rent</span></h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-01_666">THE increasing abundance of food, in consequence of increasing improvement<span class="type-margin"><span>The general course of progress is for produce other than food to become dearer,</span></span>
 and cultivation, must necessarily increase the demand for every part of
 the produce of land which is not food, and which can be applied either
to use or to ornament. In the whole progress of improvement, it might
therefore be expected, there should be only one variation in the
comparative values of those two different sorts of produce. The value of
 that sort which sometimes does and sometimes does not afford rent,
should constantly rise in proportion to that which always affords some
rent. As art and industry advance, the materials of cloathing and
lodging, the useful fossils and minerals of the earth, the precious
metals and the precious stones should gradually come to be more and more
 in demand, should gradually exchange for a greater and a greater
quantity of food, or in other words, should gradually <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>176<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 become dearer and dearer. This accordingly has been the case with most
of these things upon most occasions, and would have been the case with
all of them upon all occasions, if particular accidents had not upon
some occasions increased the supply of some of them in a still greater
proportion than the demand.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_667"><span class="type-margin"><span>but there are interruptions,</span></span>The
 value of a free-stone quarry, for example, will necessarily increase
with the increasing improvement and population of the country round
about it; especially if it should be the only one in the neighbourhood.
But the value of a silver mine, even though there should not be another
within a thousand miles of it, will not necessarily increase with the
improvement of the country in which it is situated. The market for the
produce of a free-stone quarry can seldom extend more than a few miles
round about it, and the demand must generally be in proportion to the
improvement and population of that small<span class="type-margin"><span>as in the case of silver,</span></span>
 district. But the market for the produce of a silver mine may extend
over the whole known world. Unless the world in general, therefore, be
advancing in improvement and population, the demand for silver might not
 be at all increased by the improvement even of a large<span class="type-margin"><span>when new fertile mines are discovered.</span></span>
 country in the neighbourhood of the mine. Even though the world in
general were improving, yet, if, in the course of its improvement, new
mines should be discovered, much more fertile than any which had been
known before, though the demand for silver would necessarily increase,
yet the supply might increase in so much a greater proportion, that the
real price of that metal might gradually fall; that is, any given
quantity, a pound weight of it, for example, might gradually purchase or
 command a smaller and a smaller quantity of labour, or exchange for a
smaller and a smaller quantity of corn, the principal part of the
subsistence of the labourer.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_668">The great market for silver is the commercial and civilized part of the world.</p>

 by the general progress of improvement the demand of this market should
 increase, while at the same time the supply did not increase in the
same proportion, the value of silver would gradually rise in proportion
to that of corn. Any given quantity of silver would exchange for a
greater and a greater quantity of corn; or, in other words, the average
money price of corn would gradually become cheaper and cheaper.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_670"><span class="type-margin"><span>but might grow cheaper if some accident increased the supply for many years together:</span></span>If,
 on the contrary, the supply by some accident should increase for many
years together in a greater proportion than the demand, that metal would
 gradually become cheaper and cheaper; or, in other words, the average
money price of corn would, in spite of all improvements, gradually
become dearer and dearer.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>177<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_671">But if, on the other hand, the supply of the
metal should increase nearly in the same proportion as the demand, it
would continue to purchase or exchange for nearly the same quantity of
corn, and the average money price of corn would,<span class="type-margin"><span>or remain stationary if demand and supply increased equally.</span></span> in spite of all improvements, continue very nearly the same.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_672">These three seem to exhaust all the possible

 of wheat in England seems not to have been estimated lower than four
ounces of silver, Tower-weight, equal to about twenty shillings of our
present money. From this price it seems to have fallen gradually to two
ounces of silver, equal to about ten shillings of our present money, the
 price at which we find it estimated in the beginning of the sixteenth
century, and at which it seems to have continued to be estimated till
about 1570.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt485" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt485_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_674">In 1350, being the 25th of Edward III, was enacted what is called,<span class="type-margin"><span>In 1350 wheat was 4 oz. of silver per quarter,</span></span> The statute of labourers.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt486" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt486_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> In the preamble it complains much of the insolence of servants, who endeavoured to raise their wages upon their masters.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt487" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt487_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 It therefore ordains, that all servants and labourers should for the
future be contented with the same wages and liveries (liveries <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>178<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 in those times signified, not only cloaths, but provisions) which they
had been accustomed to receive in the 20th year of the king, and the
four preceding years;<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt488" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt488_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 that upon this account their livery wheat should no-where be estimated
higher than ten-pence a bushel, and that it should always be in the
option of the master to deliver them either the wheat or the money.
Ten-pence a bushel, therefore, had, in the 25th of Edward III, been
reckoned a very moderate price of wheat, since it required a particular
statute to oblige servants to accept of it in exchange for their usual
livery of provisions; and it had been reckoned a reasonable price ten
years before that, or in the 16th year of the king, the term to which
the statute refers. But in the 16th year of Edward III, ten-pence
contained about half an ounce of silver, Tower-weight, and was nearly
equal to half a crown of our present money.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt489" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt489_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 Four ounces of silver, Tower-weight, therefore, equal to six shillings
and eight-pence of the money of those times, and to near twenty
shillings of that of the present, must have been reckoned a moderate
price for the quarter of eight bushels.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_675"><span class="type-margin"><span>and was not less than that at the beginning of the century,</span></span>This
 statute is surely a better evidence of what was reckoned in those times
 a moderate price of grain, than the prices of some particular years
which have generally been recorded by historians and other writers on
account of their extraordinary dearness or cheapness, and from which,
therefore, it is difficult to form any judgment concerning what may have
 been the ordinary price.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt490" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt490_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 There are, besides, other reasons for believing that in the beginning
of the fourteenth century, and for some time before, the common price of
 wheat was not less than four ounces of silver the quarter, and that of
other grain in proportion.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_676">In 1309, Ralph de Born, prior of St.
Augustine’s, Canterbury, gave a feast upon his installation-day, of
which William Thorn has preserved, not only the bill of fare, but the
prices of many particulars. In that feast were consumed, 1st,
Fifty-three quarters of wheat, which cost nineteen pounds, or seven
shillings and two-pence a quarter, equal to about one-and-twenty
shillings and six-pence of our present money; 2dly, Fifty-eight quarters
 of malt, which cost seventeen pounds ten shillings, or six shillings a
quarter, equal to about eighteen shillings of our present money: 3dly,
Twenty quarters of oats, which cost four pounds, or four shillings a
quarter, equal to about twelve shillings of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>179<span class="bracket">]</span></span> our present money.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt491" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt491_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> The prices of malt and oats seem here to be higher than their ordinary proportion to the price of wheat.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_677">These prices are not recorded on account of
their extraordinary dearness or cheapness, but are mentioned
accidentally as the prices actually paid for large quantities of grain
consumed at a feast which was famous for its magnificence.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_678">In 1262, being the 51st of Henry III, was revived an ancient statute<span class="type-margin"><span>and for some time before.</span></span> called, <span class="ital">The Assize of Bread and Ale,</span><a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt492" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt492_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 which, the king says in the preamble, had been made in the times of his
 progenitors sometime kings of England. It is probably, therefore, as
old at least as the time of his grandfather Henry II, and may have been
as old as the conquest. It regulates the price of bread according as the
 prices of wheat may happen to be, from one shilling to twenty shillings
 the quarter of the money of those times. But statutes of this kind are
generally presumed to provide with equal care for all deviations from
the middle price, for those below it as well as for those above it. Ten
shillings, therefore, containing six ounces of silver, Tower-weight, and
 equal to about thirty shillings of our present money, must, upon this
supposition, have been reckoned the middle price of the quarter of wheat
 when this statute was first enacted, and must have continued to be so
in the 51st of Henry III. We cannot therefore be very wrong<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt493" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt493_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 in supposing that the middle price was not less than one-third of the
highest price at which this statute regulates the price of bread, or
than six shillings and eight-pence of the money of those times,
containing four ounces of silver, Tower-weight.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_679">From these different facts, therefore, we seem
 to have some reason to conclude, that about the middle of the
fourteenth century, and for a considerable time before, the average or
ordinary price of the quarter of wheat was not supposed to be less than
four ounces of silver, Tower-weight.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_680">From about the middle of the fourteenth to the beginning of the<span class="type-margin"><span>From that it sank gradually to 2 oz. at the beginning of the sixteenth century and remained at that till 1570.</span></span>
 sixteenth century, what was reckoned the reasonable and moderate, that
is the ordinary or average price of wheat, seems to have sunk gradually
to about one-half of this price; so as at last to have fallen to about
two ounces of silver, Tower-weight, equal to about ten shillings of our
present money. It continued to be estimated at this price till about
1570.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>180<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_681">In the houshold book of Henry, the fifth earl
of Northumberland, drawn up in 1512, there are two different estimations
 of wheat. In one of them it is computed at six shillings and
eight-pence the quarter, in the other at five shillings and eight-pence
only.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt494" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt494_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 In 1512, six shillings and eight-pence contained only two ounces of
silver, Tower-weight, and were equal to about ten shillings of our
present money.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_682">From the 25th of Edward III, to the beginning
of the reign of Elizabeth, during the space of more than two hundred
years, six shillings and eight-pence, it appears from several different
statutes, had continued to be considered as what is called the moderate
and reasonable, that is the ordinary or average price of wheat. The
quantity of silver, however, contained in that nominal sum was, during
the course of this period, continually diminishing, in consequence of
some alterations which were made in the coin. But the increase of the
value of silver had, it seems, so far compensated the diminution of the
quantity of it contained in the same nominal sum, that the legislature
did not think it worth while to attend to this circumstance.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_683">Thus in 1436 it was enacted, that wheat might
be exported without a licence when the price was so low as six shillings
 and eight-pence:<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt495" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt495_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 And in 1463 it was enacted, that no wheat should be imported if the
price was not above six shillings and eight-pence the quarter.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt496" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt496_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 The legislature had imagined, that when the price was so low, there
could be no inconveniency in exportation, but that when it rose higher,
it became prudent to allow of importation. Six shillings and
eight-pence, therefore, containing about the same quantity of silver as
thirteen shillings and four-pence of our present money (one third part
less than the same nominal sum contained in the time of Edward III), had
 in those times been considered as what is called the moderate and
reasonable price of wheat.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_684">In 1554, by the 1st and 2d of Philip and Mary;<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt497" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt497_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> and in 1558, by the 1st of Elizabeth,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt498" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt498_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a>
 the exportation of wheat was in the same manner prohibited, whenever
the price of the quarter should exceed six shillings and eight-pence,
which did not then contain two penny worth more silver than the same
nominal sum does at present. But it had soon <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>181<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 been found that to restrain the exportation of wheat till the price was
 so very low, was, in reality, to prohibit it altogether. In 1562,
therefore, by the 5th of Elizabeth,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt499" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt499_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 the exportation of wheat was allowed from certain ports whenever the
price of the quarter should not exceed ten shillings, containing nearly
the same quantity of silver as the like nominal sum does at present.
This price had at this time, therefore, been considered as what is
called the moderate and reasonable price of wheat. It agrees nearly with
 the estimation of the Northumberland book in 1512.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_685">That in France the average price of grain was, in the same manner,<span class="type-margin"><span>The same fall has been observed in France.</span></span>
 much lower in the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth
century, than in the two centuries preceding, has been observed both by
Mr. Duprè de St. Maur,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt500" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt500_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> and by the elegant author of the Essay on the police of grain.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt501" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt501_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> Its price, during the same period, had probably sunk in the same manner through the greater part of Europe.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_686">This rise in the value of silver, in proportion to that of corn, may<span class="type-margin"><span>It may have been due to the increase of demand for silver or to a diminution of supply.</span></span>
 either have been owing altogether to the increase of the demand for
that metal, in consequence of increasing improvement and cultivation,
the supply in the mean time continuing the same as before: Or, the
demand continuing the same as before, it may have been owing altogether
to the gradual diminution of the supply; the greater part of the mines
which were then known in the world, being much exhausted, and
consequently the expence of working them much increased: Or it may have
been owing partly to the one and partly to the other of those two
circumstances. In the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the
sixteenth centuries, the greater part of Europe was approaching towards a
 more settled form of government than it had enjoyed for several ages
before. The increase of security would naturally increase industry and
improvement; and the demand for the precious metals, as well as for
every other luxury and ornament, would naturally increase with the
increase of riches. A greater annual produce would require a greater
quantity of coin to circulate it; and a greater number of rich people
would require a greater quantity of plate and other ornaments of silver.
 It is natural to suppose too, that the greater part of the mines which
then supplied the European market with silver, might be a good deal <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>182<span class="bracket">]</span></span> exhausted, and have become more expensive in the working. They had been wrought many of them from the time of the Romans.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_687"><span class="type-margin"><span>Most writers, however, have supposed that the value of silver continually fell.</span></span>It
 has been the opinion, however, of the greater part of those who have
written upon the prices of commodities in ancient times, that, from the
Conquest, perhaps from the invasion of Julius Cæsar, till the discovery
of the mines of America, the value of silver was continually
diminishing. This opinion they seem to have been led into, partly by the
 observations which they had occasion to make upon the prices both of
corn and of some other parts of the rude produce of land; and partly by
the popular notion, that as the quantity of silver naturally increases
in every country with the increase of wealth, so its value diminishes as
 its quantity increases.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_688"><span class="type-margin"><span>They have been misled in their observations on the price of corn, (1) by confusing conversion prices with market prices;</span></span>In their observations upon the prices of corn, three different circumstances seem frequently to have misled them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_689">First, In ancient times almost all rents were
paid in kind; in a certain quantity of corn, cattle, poultry, &amp;c. It
 sometimes happened, however, that the landlord would stipulate,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt502" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt502_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 that he should be at liberty to demand of the tenant, either the annual
 payment in kind, or a certain sum of money instead of it. The price at
which the payment in kind was in this manner exchanged for a certain sum
 of money, is in Scotland called the conversion price. As the option is
always in the landlord to take either the substance or the price, it is
necessary for the safety of the tenant, that the conversion price should
 rather be below than above the average market price. In many places,
accordingly, it is not much above one-half of this price. Through the
greater part of Scotland this custom still continues with regard to
poultry, and in some places with regard to cattle. It might probably
have continued to take place too with regard to corn, had not the
institution of the public fiars put an end to it. These are annual
valuations, according to the judgment of an assize, of the average price
 of all the different sorts of grain, and of all the different qualities
 of each, according to the actual market price in every different
county. This institution rendered it sufficiently safe for the tenant,
and much more convenient for the landlord, to convert, as they call it,
the corn rent, rather at what should happen to be the price of the fiars
 of each year,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt503" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt503_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 than at any certain fixed price. But the writers who have collected the
 prices of corn in ancient times, seem frequently to have mistaken what
is called in Scotland the conversion price for the actual market price.
Fleetwood acknowledges, upon one occasion, that he had made this
mistake. As he wrote his <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>183<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 book, however, for a particular purpose, he does not think proper to
make this acknowledgment till after transcribing this conversion price
fifteen times.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt504" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt504_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The price is eight shillings the quarter of wheat. This sum in 1423,
the year at which he begins with it, contained the same quantity of
silver as sixteen shillings of our present money. But in 1562, the year
at which he ends with it, it contained no more than the same nominal sum
 does at present.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_690">Secondly, They have been misled by the slovenly manner in which<span class="type-margin"><span>(2) by the slovenly transcription of ancient statutes of assize;</span></span>
 some ancient statutes of assize had been sometimes transcribed by lazy
copiers; and sometimes perhaps actually composed by the legislature.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_691">The ancient statutes of assize seem to have
begun always with determining what ought to be the price of bread and
ale when the price of wheat and barley were at the lowest, and to have
proceeded gradually to determine what it ought to be, according as the
prices of those two sorts of grain should gradually rise above this
lowest price. But the transcribers of those statutes seem frequently to
have thought it sufficient, to copy the regulation as far as the three
or four first and lowest prices; saving in this manner their own labour,
 and judging, I suppose, that this was enough to show what proportion
ought to be observed in all higher prices.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_692">Thus in the assize of bread and ale, of the
51st of Henry III, the price of bread was regulated according to the
different prices of wheat, from one shilling to twenty shillings the
quarter, of the money of those times. But in the manuscripts from which
all the different editions of the statutes, preceding that of Mr.
Ruffhead, were printed, the copiers had never transcribed this
regulation beyond the price of twelve shillings.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt505" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt505_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 Several writers, therefore, being misled by this faulty transcription,
very naturally concluded that the middle price, or six shillings the
quarter, equal to about eighteen shillings of our present money, was the
 ordinary or average price of wheat at that time.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_693">In the statute of Tumbrel and Pillory,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt506" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt506_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> enacted nearly about the<span class="type-margin"><span>or by misunderstandings of those statutes,</span></span>
 same time, the price of ale is regulated according to every sixpence
rise in the price of barley, from two shillings to four shillings the
quarter. That four shillings, however, was not considered as the highest
 price to which barley might frequently rise in those times, and that
these prices were only given as an example of the proportion <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>184<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 which ought to be observed in all other prices, whether higher or
lower, we may infer from the last words of the statute; “et sic deinceps
 crescetur vel diminuetur per sex denarios.” The expression is very
slovenly, but the meaning is plain enough; “That the price of ale is in
this manner to be increased or diminished according to every sixpence
rise or fall in the price of barley.” In the composition of this statute
 the legislature itself seems to have been as negligent as the copiers
were in the transcription of the other.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_694">In an ancient manuscript of the Regiam
Majestatem, an old Scotch law book, there is a statute of assize, in
which the price of bread is regulated according to all the different
prices of wheat, from ten-pence to three shillings the Scotch boll,
equal to about half an English quarter. Three shillings Scotch, at the
time when this assize is supposed to have been enacted, were equal to
about nine shillings sterling of our present money. Mr. Ruddiman<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt507" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt507_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> seems<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt508" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt508_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 to conclude from this, that three shillings was the highest price to
which wheat ever rose in those times, and that ten-pence, a shilling, or
 at most two shillings, were the ordinary prices. Upon consulting the
manuscript, however, it appears evidently, that all these prices are
only set down as examples of the proportion which ought to be observed
between the respective prices of wheat and bread. The last words of the
statute are, “reliqua judicabis secundum præscripta habendo respectum ad
 pretium bladi.” “You shall judge of the remaining cases according to
what is above written having a respect to the price of corn.”<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt509" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt509_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_695"><span class="type-margin"><span>and (3) by attributing too much importance to excessively low prices.</span></span>Thirdly,
 They seem to have been misled too by the very low price at which wheat
was sometimes sold in very ancient times; and to have imagined, that as
its lowest price was then much lower than in later times, its ordinary
price must likewise have been much lower. They might have found,
however, that in those ancient times, its highest price was fully as
much above, as its lowest price was below any thing that had ever been
known in later times. Thus in 1270, Fleetwood gives us two prices of the
 quarter of wheat.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt510" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt510_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> The one is four pounds sixteen shillings of the money of those times, equal to fourteen pounds <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>185<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 eight shillings of that of the present; the other is six pounds eight
shillings, equal to nineteen pounds four shillings of our present money.
 No price can be found in the end of the fifteenth, or beginning of the
sixteenth century, which approaches to the extravagance of these. The
price of corn, though at all times liable to variation,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt511" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt511_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 varies most in those turbulent and disorderly societies, in which the
interruption of all commerce and communication hinders the plenty of one
 part of the country from relieving the scarcity of another. In the
disorderly state of England under the Plantagenets, who governed it from
 about the middle of the twelfth, till towards the end of the fifteenth
century, one district might be in plenty, while another at no great
distance, by having its crop destroyed either by some accident of the
seasons, or by the incursion of some neighbouring baron, might be
suffering all the horrors of a famine; and yet if the lands of some
hostile lord were interposed between them, the one might not be able to
give the least assistance to the other. Under the vigorous
administration of the Tudors, who governed England during the latter
part of the fifteenth, and through the whole of the sixteenth century,
no baron was powerful enough to dare to disturb the public security.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_696">The reader will find at the end of this chapter all the prices of wheat<span class="type-margin"><span>The figures at the end of the chapter confirm this account.</span></span>
 which have been collected by Fleetwood from 1202 to 1597, both
inclusive, reduced to the money of the present times, and digested
according to the order of time, into seven divisions of twelve years
each. At the end of each division too, he will find the average price of
 the twelve years of which it consists. In that long period of time,
Fleetwood has been able to collect the prices of no more than eighty
years, so that four years are wanting to make out the last twelve years.
 I have added, therefore, from the accounts of Eton College, the prices
of 1598, 1599, 1600, and 1601.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt512" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt512_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 It is the only addition which I have made. The reader will see, that
from the beginning of the thirteenth, till after the middle of the
sixteenth century, the average price of each twelve years grows
gradually lower and lower; and that towards the end of the sixteenth
century it begins to rise again. The prices, indeed, which Fleetwood has
 been able to collect, seem to have been those chiefly which were
remarkable for extraordinary dearness or cheapness; and I do not pretend
 that any very certain conclusion can be drawn from them. So far,
however, as they prove any thing at all, they confirm the account which I
 have been endeavouring to give. Fleetwood himself, however, seems, with
 most other writers, to have believed,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt513" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt513_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>186<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 that during all this period the value of silver, in consequence of its
increasing abundance, was continually diminishing. The prices of corn
which he himself has collected, certainly do not agree with this
opinion. They agree perfectly with that of Mr. Duprè de St. Maur,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt514" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt514_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 and with that which I have been endeavouring to explain. Bishop
Fleetwood and Mr. Duprè de St. Maur are the two authors who seem to have
 collected, with the greatest diligence and fidelity, the prices of
things in ancient times. It is somewhat curious that, though their
opinions are so very different, their facts, so far as they relate to
the price of corn at least, should coincide so very exactly.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_697"><span class="type-margin"><span>Sometimes the
value of silver has been measured by the price of cattle, poultry, etc.
But the low price of these things shows their cheapness, not the
dearness of silver,</span></span>It is not, however, so much from the
low price of corn, as from that of some other parts of the rude produce
of land, that the most judicious writers have inferred the great value
of silver in those very ancient times. Corn, it has been said, being a
sort of manufacture, was, in those rude ages, much dearer in proportion
than the greater part of other commodities; it is meant, I suppose, than
 the greater part of unmanufactured commodities; such as cattle,
poultry, game of all kinds, &amp;c. That in those times of poverty and
barbarism these were proportionably much cheaper than corn, is
undoubtedly true. But this cheapness was not the effect of the high
value of silver, but of the low value of those commodities. It was not
because silver would in such times purchase or represent a greater
quantity of labour, but because<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt515" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt515_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 such commodities would purchase or represent a much smaller quantity
than in times of more opulence and improvement. Silver must certainly be
 cheaper in Spanish America than in Europe; in the country where it is
produced, than in the country to which it is brought, at the expence of a
 long carriage both by land and by sea, of a freight and an insurance.
One-and-twenty pence halfpenny sterling, however, we are told by Ulloa,
was, not many years ago, at Buenos Ayres, the price of an ox chosen from
 a herd of three or four hundred.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt516" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt516_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> Sixteen shillings sterling, we are told by Mr. Byron, was the price of a good horse in the capital of Chili.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt517" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt517_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 In a country naturally fertile, but of which the far greater part is
altogether uncultivated, cattle, poultry, game of all kinds, &amp;c. as
they can be acquired with a very small quantity of labour, so they will
purchase or command but a very small quantity. The low money price for
which they may be sold, is no proof that the real value <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>187<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of silver is there very high, but that the real value of those commodities is very low.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_698">Labour, it must always be remembered, and not any particular<span class="type-margin"><span>for labour is the real measure.</span></span> commodity or set of commodities, is the real measure of the value both of silver and of all other commodities.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_699">But in countries almost waste, or but thinly inhabited, cattle, poultry,<span class="type-margin"><span>Cattle, poultry, etc., are produced by very different quantities of labour at different times,</span></span>
 game of all kinds, &amp;c. as they are the spontaneous productions of
nature, so she frequently produces them in much greater quantities than
the consumption of the inhabitants requires. In such a state of things
the supply commonly exceeds the demand. In different states of society,
in different stages of improvement, therefore, such commodities will
represent, or be equivalent to, very different quantities of labour.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_700">In every state of society, in every stage of improvement, corn is the<span class="type-margin"><span>whereas corn scarcely varies at all,</span></span>
 production of human industry. But the average produce of every sort of
industry is always suited, more or less exactly, to the average
consumption; the average supply to the average demand. In every
different stage of improvement, besides, the raising of equal quantities
 of corn in the same soil and climate, will, at an average, require
nearly equal quantities of labour; or what comes to the same thing, the
price of nearly equal quantities; the continual increase of the
productive powers of labour in an improving<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt518" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt518_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 state of cultivation being more or less counterbalanced by the
continually increasing price of cattle, the principal instruments of
agriculture. Upon all these accounts, therefore, we may rest assured,
that equal quantities of corn will, in every state of society, in every
stage of improvement, more nearly represent, or be equivalent to, equal
quantities of labour, than equal quantities of any other part of the
rude produce of land. Corn, accordingly, it has already been observed,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt519" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt519_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 is, in all the different stages of wealth and improvement, a more
accurate measure of value than any other commodity or set of
commodities. In all those different stages, therefore, we can judge
better of the real value of silver, by comparing it with corn, than by
comparing it with any other commodity, or set of commodities.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_701">Corn, besides, or whatever else is the common and favourite<span class="type-margin"><span>and also regulates the money price of labour.</span></span>
 vegetable food of the people, constitutes, in every civilized country,
the principal part of the subsistence of the labourer. In consequence of
 the extension of agriculture, the land of every country produces a much
 greater quantity of vegetable than of animal food, and the labourer
every-where lives chiefly upon the wholesome food that is cheapest and
most abundant. Butcher’s-meat, except in the most <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>188<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 thriving countries, or where labour is most highly rewarded, makes but
an insignificant part of his subsistence; poultry makes a still smaller
part of it, and game no part of it. In France, and even in Scotland,
where labour is somewhat better rewarded than in France, the labouring
poor seldom eat butcher’s-meat, except upon holidays, and other
extraordinary occasions. The money price of labour, therefore, depends
much more upon the average money price of corn, the subsistence of the
labourer, than upon that of butcher’s-meat, or of any other part of the
rude produce of land. The real value of gold and silver, therefore, the
real quantity of labour which they can purchase or command, depends much
 more upon the quantity of corn which they can purchase or command, than
 upon that of butcher’s-meat, or any other part of the rude produce of
land.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_702"><span class="type-margin"><span>The authors were also misled by the notion that silver falls in value as its quantity increases.</span></span>Such
 slight observations, however, upon the prices either of corn or of
other commodities, would not probably have misled so many intelligent
authors, had they not been influenced, at the same time, by the popular
notion,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt520" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt520_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 that as the quantity of silver naturally increases in every country
with the increase of wealth, so its value diminishes as its quantity
increases. This notion, however, seems to be altogether groundless.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_703">The quantity of the precious metals may
increase in any country from two different causes: either, first, from
the increased abundance of the mines which supply it; or, secondly, from
 the increased wealth of the people, from the increased produce of their
 annual labour. The first of these causes is no doubt necessarily
connected with the diminution of the value of the precious metals; but
the second is not.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_704"><span class="type-margin"><span>Increase of quantity arising from greater abundance of the mines is connected with diminution of value,</span></span>When
 more abundant mines are discovered, a greater quantity of the precious
metals is brought to market, and the quantity of the necessaries and
conveniencies of life for which they must be exchanged being the same as
 before, equal quantities of the metals must be exchanged for smaller
quantities of commodities. So far, therefore, as the increase of the
quantity of the precious metals in any country arises from the increased
 abundance of the mines, it is necessarily connected with some
diminution of their value.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_705"><span class="type-margin"><span>but increase of quantity resulting from the increased wealth of a country is not</span></span>When,
 on the contrary, the wealth of any country increases, when the annual
produce of its labour becomes gradually greater and greater, a greater
quantity of coin becomes necessary in order to circulate a greater
quantity of commodities: and the people, as they can afford it, as they
have more commodities to give for it, will naturally purchase a greater
and a greater quantity of plate. The quantity of their coin <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>189<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 will increase from necessity; the quantity of their plate from vanity
and ostentation, or from the same reason that the quantity of fine
statues, pictures, and of every other luxury and curiosity, is likely to
 increase among them. But as statuaries and painters are not likely to
be worse rewarded in times of wealth and prosperity, than in times of
poverty and depression, so gold and silver are not likely to be worse
paid for.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_706">The price of gold and silver, when the accidental discovery of more<span class="type-margin"><span>Gold and silver are dearer in a rich country,</span></span>
 abundant mines does not keep it down, as it naturally rises with the
wealth of every country, so, whatever be the state of the mines, it is
at all times naturally higher in a rich than in a poor country. Gold and
 silver, like all other commodities, naturally seek the market where the
 best price is given for them, and the best price is commonly given for
every thing in the country which can best afford it. Labour, it must be
remembered, is the ultimate price which is paid for every thing, and in
countries where labour is equally well rewarded, the money price of
labour will be in proportion to that of the subsistence of the labourer.
 But gold and silver will naturally exchange for a greater quantity of
subsistence in a rich than in a poor country, in a country which abounds
 with subsistence, than in one which is but indifferently supplied with
it. If the two countries are at a great distance, the difference may be
very great; because though the metals naturally fly from the worse to
the better market, yet it may be difficult to transport them in such
quantities as to bring their price nearly to a level in both. If the
countries are near, the difference will be smaller, and may sometimes be
 scarce perceptible; because in this case the transportation will be
easy. China is a much richer country than any part of Europe, and<span class="type-margin"><span>as may be shown by comparing China with Europe and Scotland with England as to the price of subsistence.</span></span>
 the difference between the price of subsistence in China and in Europe
is very great. Rice in China is much cheaper than wheat is any-where in
Europe. England is a much richer country than Scotland; but the
difference between the money-price of corn in those two countries is
much smaller, and is but just perceptible. In proportion to the quantity
 or measure, Scotch corn generally appears to be a good deal cheaper
than English; but in proportion to its quality, it is certainly somewhat
 dearer. Scotland receives almost every year very large supplies from
England, and every commodity must commonly be somewhat dearer in the
country to which it is brought than in that from which it comes. English
 corn, therefore, must be dearer in Scotland than in England, and yet in
 proportion to its quality, or to the quantity and goodness of the flour
 or meal which can be made from it, it cannot commonly be sold higher
there than the Scotch corn which comes to market in competition with it.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>190<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_707">The difference between the money price of
labour in China and in Europe, is still greater than that between the
money price of subsistence; because the real recompence of labour is
higher in Europe than in China, the greater part of Europe being in an
improving state, while China seems to be standing still. The money price
 of labour is lower in Scotland than in England, because the real
recompence of labour is much lower; Scotland, though advancing to
greater wealth, advancing much more slowly than England.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt521" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt521_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The frequency of emigration from Scotland, and the rarity of it from
England, sufficiently prove that the demand for labour is very different
 in the two countries.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt522" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt522_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 The proportion between the real recompence of labour in different
countries, it must be remembered, is naturally regulated, not by their
actual wealth or poverty, but by their advancing, stationary, or
declining condition.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_708"><span class="type-margin"><span>Gold and silver are cheapest among the poorest nations.</span></span>Gold
 and silver, as they are naturally of the greatest value among the
richest, so they are naturally of the least value among the poorest
nations. Among savages, the poorest of all nations, they are of scarce
any value.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_709">In great towns corn is always dearer than in
remote parts of the country. This, however, is the effect, not of the
real cheapness of silver, but of the real dearness of corn.<span class="type-margin"><span>The fact that corn is dearer in towns is due to its dearness there, not to the cheapness of silver,</span></span>
 It does not cost less labour to bring silver to the great town than to
the remote parts of the country; but it costs a great deal more to bring
 corn.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_710">In some very rich and commercial countries,
such as Holland and the territory of Genoa, corn is dear for the same
reason that it is dear in great towns. They do not produce enough to
maintain their inhabitants.<span class="type-margin"><span>and this is true also in Holland, Genoa, etc.</span></span>
 They are rich in the industry and skill of their artificers and
manufacturers; in every sort of machinery which can facilitate and
abridge labour; in shipping, and in all the other instruments and means
of carriage and commerce: but they are poor in corn, which, as it must
be brought to them from distant countries, must, by an addition to its
price, pay for the carriage from those countries. It does not cost less
labour to bring silver to Amsterdam than to Dantzick; but it costs a
great deal more to bring corn. The real cost of silver must be nearly
the same in both places; but that of corn must be very different.
Diminish the real opulence either of Holland or of the territory of
Genoa, while the number of their inhabitants remains the same: diminish
their power of supplying themselves from distant countries; and the
price of corn, instead of sinking with that diminution in the quantity
of their silver, which must necessarily accompany this declension either
 as its cause or as its effect, will rise to the price <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>191<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of a famine. When we are in want of necessaries we must part with all
superfluities, of which the value, as it rises in times of opulence and
prosperity, so it sinks in times of poverty and distress. It is
otherwise with necessaries. Their real price, the quantity of labour
which they can purchase or command, rises in times of poverty and
distress, and sinks in times of opulence and prosperity, which are
always times of great abundance; for they could not otherwise be times
of opulence and prosperity. Corn is a necessary, silver is only a
superfluity.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_711">Whatever, therefore, may have been the increase in the quantity of<span class="type-margin"><span>So no increase of silver due to the increase of wealth could have reduced its value.</span></span>
 the precious metals, which, during the period between the middle of the
 fourteenth and that of the sixteenth century, arose from the increase
of wealth and improvement, it could have no tendency to diminish their
value either in Great Britain, or in any other part of Europe. If those
who have collected the prices of things in ancient times, therefore,
had, during this period, no reason to infer the diminution of the value
of silver, from any observations which they had made upon the prices
either of corn or of other commodities, they had still less reason to
infer it from any supposed increase of wealth and improvement.</p>

<h2 id="lf0206-01_head_025"><span class="csc">Second Period</span></h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-01_712">BUT how various soever may have been the opinions of the learned<span class="type-margin"><span>No doubt exists as to the second period,</span></span> concerning the progress of the value of silver during this first period, they are unanimous concerning it during the second.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_713">From about 1570 to about 1640, during a period of about seventy years,<span class="type-margin"><span>silver sank, and a quarter of corn came to be worth 6 oz. or 8 oz. of silver.</span></span>
 the variation in the proportion between the value of silver and that of
 corn, held a quite opposite course. Silver sunk in its real value, or
would exchange for a smaller quantity of labour than before; and corn
rose in its nominal price, and instead of being commonly sold for about
two ounces of silver the quarter, or about ten shillings of our present
money, came to be sold for six and eight ounces of silver the quarter,
or about thirty and forty shillings of our present money.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_714">The discovery of the abundant mines of America, seems to have been<span class="type-margin"><span>This was owing to the discovery of the abundant American mines.</span></span>
 the sole cause of this diminution in the value of silver in proportion
to that of corn. It is accounted for accordingly in the same manner by
every body; and there never has been any dispute either about the fact,
or about the cause of it. The greater part of Europe was, during this
period, advancing in industry and improvement, and the demand for silver
 must consequently have been increasing. But the increase of the supply
had, it seems, so far exceeded that of the demand, that the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>192<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 value of that metal sunk considerably. The discovery of the mines of
America, it is to be observed, does not seem to have had any very
sensible effect upon the prices of things in England till after 1570;
though even the mines of Potosi had been discovered more than twenty
years before.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt523" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt523_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>

<h2 id="lf0206-01_head_026"><span class="csc">Third Period</span></h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-01_717"><span class="type-margin"><span>The effect of the discovery of the American mines was complete about 1636.</span></span>BETWEEN
 1630 and 1640, or about 1636, the effect of the discovery of the mines
of America in reducing the value of silver, appears to have been
completed, and the value of that metal seems never to have sunk lower in
 proportion to that of corn than it was about that time. It seems to
have risen somewhat in the course of the present century, and it had
probably begun to do so even some time before the end of the last.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_718"><span class="type-margin"><span>From 1637 to 1700 there was a very slight rise of wheat at Windsor,</span></span>From
 1637 to 1700, both inclusive, being the sixty-four last years of the
last century, the average price of the quarter of nine bushels of the
best wheat at Windsor market, appears, from the same accounts, to have
been 2 <span class="ital">l.</span> 11 <span class="ital">s.</span> 0 <span class="ital">d.</span> ⅓; which is only 1 <span class="ital">s.</span> 0 <span class="ital">d.</span> ⅓ dearer than it had <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>193<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 been during the sixteen years before. But in the course of these
sixty-four years there happened two events which must have produced a
much greater scarcity of corn than what the course of the seasons would
otherwise have occasioned, and which, therefore, without supposing any
further reduction in the value of silver, will much more than account
for this very small enhancement of price.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_719">The first of these events was the civil war, which, by discouraging<span class="type-margin"><span>due to the civil war,</span></span>
 tillage and interrupting commerce, must have raised the price of corn
much above what the course of the seasons would otherwise have
occasioned. It must have had this effect more or less at all the
different markets in the kingdom, but particularly at those in the
neighbourhood of London, which require to be supplied from the greatest
distance. In 1648, accordingly, the price of the best wheat at Windsor
market, appears, from the same accounts, to have been 4 <span class="ital">l.</span> 5 <span class="ital">s.</span> and in 1649 to have been 4 <span class="ital">l.</span> the quarter of nine bushels. The excess of those two years above 2 <span class="ital">l.</span> 10 <span class="ital">s.</span> (the average price of the sixteen years preceding 1637) is 3 <span class="ital">l.</span> 5 <span class="ital">s.;</span>
 which divided among the sixty-four last years of the last century, will
 alone very nearly account for that small enhancement of price which
seems to have taken place in them. These, however, though the highest,
are by no means the only high prices which seem to have been occasioned
by the civil wars.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_720">The second event was the bounty upon the exportation of corn,<span class="type-margin"><span>the bounty on the exportation of corn,</span></span> granted in 1688.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt526" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt526_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The bounty, it has been thought by many people, by encouraging tillage,
 may, in a long course of years, have occasioned a greater abundance,
and consequently a greater cheapness of corn in the home-market, than
what would otherwise have taken place there. How far the bounty could
produce this effect at any time, I shall examine hereafter;<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt527" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt527_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> I shall only observe at present, that<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt528" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt528_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> between 1688 and 1700, it had not time to produce any such effect.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt529" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt529_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 During this short period its only effect must have been, by encouraging
 the exportation of the surplus produce of every year, and thereby
hindering the abundance of one year from compensating the scarcity of
another, to raise the price in the home-market. The scarcity which
prevailed <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>194<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 in England from 1693 to 1699, both inclusive, though no doubt
principally owing to the badness of the seasons, and, therefore,
extending through a considerable part of Europe, must have been somewhat
 enhanced by the bounty. In 1699, accordingly, the further exportation
of corn was prohibited for nine months.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt530" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt530_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_721"><span class="type-margin"><span>and the clipping and wearing of the coin,</span></span>There
 was a third event which occurred in the course of the same period, and
which, though it could not occasion any scarcity of corn, nor, perhaps,
any augmentation in the real quantity of silver which was usually paid
for it, must necessarily have occasioned some augmentation in the
nominal sum. This event was the great debasement<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt531" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt531_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 of the silver coin, by clipping and wearing. This evil had begun in the
 reign of Charles II. and had gone on continually increasing till 1695;
at which time, as we may learn from Mr. Lowndes, the current silver coin
 was, at an average, near five-and-twenty per cent. below its standard
value.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt532" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt532_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 But the nominal sum which constitutes the market-price of every
commodity is necessarily regulated, not so much by the quantity of
silver, which, according to the standard, ought to be contained in it,
as by that which, it is found by experience, actually is contained in
it. This nominal sum, therefore, is necessarily higher when the coin is
much debased<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt533" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt533_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> by clipping and wearing, than when near to its standard value.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_722"><span class="type-margin"><span>which was then much greater than in the present century.</span></span>In
 the course of the present century, the silver coin has not at any time
been more below its standard weight than it is at present. But though
very much defaced, its value has been kept up by that of the gold coin
for which it is exchanged.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt534" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt534_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a>
 For though before the late re-coinage, the gold coin was a good deal
defaced too, it was less so than the silver. In 1695, on the contrary,
the value of the silver coin was not kept up by the gold coin; a guinea
then commonly exchanging <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>195<span class="bracket">]</span></span> for thirty shillings of the worn and clipt silver.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt535" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt535_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Before the late re-coinage of the gold, the price of silver bullion was
 seldom higher than five shillings and seven-pence an ounce, which is
but five-pence above the mint price. But in 1695, the common price of
silver bullion was six shillings and five-pence an ounce,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt536" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt536_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> which is fifteen-pence above the mint price. Even before the late re-coinage of the gold,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt537" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt537_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 therefore, the coin, gold and silver together, when compared with
silver bullion, was not supposed to be more than eight per cent. below
its standard value. In 1695, on the contrary, it had been supposed to be
 near five-and-twenty per cent. below that value. But in the beginning
of the present century, that is, immediately after the great re-coinage
in King William’s time, the greater part of the current silver coin must
 have been still nearer to its standard weight than it is at present. In
 the course of the present century too there has been no great public
calamity, such as the civil war, which could either discourage tillage,
or interrupt the interior commerce of the country. And though the<span class="type-margin"><span>Moreover the bounty has been long enough in existence to produce any possible effect in lowering the price of corn.</span></span>
 bounty which has taken place through the greater part of this century,
must always raise the price of corn somewhat higher than it otherwise
would be in the actual state of tillage;<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt538" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt538_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 yet as, in the course of this century, the bounty has had full time to
produce all the good effects commonly imputed to it, to encourage
tillage, and thereby to increase the quantity of corn in the home
market, it may, upon the principles of a system which I shall explain
and examine hereafter,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt539" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt539_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a>
 be supposed to have done something to lower the price of that commodity
 the one way, as well as to raise it the other. It is by many people
supposed to have done more.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt540" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt540_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">6</a> In the sixty-four first<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt541" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt541_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">7</a>
 years of the present century accordingly, the average price of the
quarter of nine bushels of the best wheat at Windsor market, appears, by
 the accounts of Eton College, to have been 2 <span class="ital">l.</span> 0 <span class="ital">s.</span> 6 <span class="ital">d.</span> 19/32,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt542" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt542_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">8</a> which is about ten shillings and sixpence, or more than five-and-twenty per cent. cheaper<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt543" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt543_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">9</a>
 than it had been during the sixty-four last years of the last century;
and about nine shillings and sixpence cheaper than it had been during
the sixteen <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>196<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 years preceding 1636, when the discovery of the abundant mines of
America may be supposed to have produced its full effect; and about one
shilling cheaper than it had been in the twenty-six years preceding
1620, before that discovery can well be supposed to have produced its
full effect. According to this account, the average price of middle
wheat, during these sixty-four first years of the present century, comes
 out to have been about thirty-two shillings the quarter of eight
bushels.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_723"><span class="type-margin"><span>Silver has risen somewhat since the beginning of the century, and the rise began before,</span></span>The
 value of silver, therefore, seems to have risen somewhat in proportion
to that of corn during the course of the present century, and it had
probably begun to do so even some time before the end of the last.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_724">In 1687, the price of the quarter of nine bushels of the best wheat at Windsor market was 1 <span class="ital">l.</span> 5 <span class="ital">s.</span> 2 <span class="ital">d.</span> the lowest price at which it had ever been from 1595.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_725"><span class="type-margin"><span>as is shown by Mr. King’s calculations.</span></span>In
 1688, Mr. Gregory King, a man famous for his knowledge in matters of
this kind, estimated the average price of wheat in years of moderate
plenty to be to the grower 3 <span class="ital">s.</span> 6 <span class="ital">d.</span> the bushel, or eight-and-twenty shillings the quarter.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt544" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt544_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The grower’s price I understand to be the same with what is sometimes
called the contract price, or the price at which a farmer contracts for a
 certain number of years to deliver a certain quantity of corn to a
dealer. As a contract of this kind saves the farmer the expence and
trouble of marketing, the contract price is generally lower than what is
 supposed to be the average market price. Mr. King had judged
eight-and-twenty shillings the quarter to be at that time the ordinary
contract price in years of moderate plenty. Before the scarcity
occasioned by the late extraordinary course of bad seasons, it was, I
have been assured,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt545" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt545_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> the ordinary contract price in all common years.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_726">In 1688 was granted the parliamentary bounty upon the exportation of corn.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt546" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt546_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 The country gentlemen, who then composed a still greater proportion of
the legislature than they do at present, had felt that the money price
of corn was falling. The bounty was an expedient to raise it
artificially to the high price at which it had frequently been sold in
the times of Charles I. and II. It was to <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>197<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 take place, therefore, till wheat was so high as forty-eight shillings
the quarter; that is twenty shillings, or 5/7ths dearer than Mr. King
had in that very year estimated the grower’s price to be in times of
moderate plenty. If his calculations deserve any part of the reputation
which they have obtained very universally, eight-and-forty shillings the
 quarter was a price which, without some such expedient as the bounty,
could not at that time be expected, except in years of extraordinary
scarcity. But the government of King William was not then fully settled.
 It was in no condition to refuse any thing to the country gentlemen,
from whom it was at that very time soliciting the first establishment of
 the annual land-tax.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_727">The value of silver, therefore, in proportion
to that of corn, had probably risen somewhat before the end of the last
century; and it seems to have continued to do so during the course of
the greater part of the present; though the necessary operation of the
bounty must have hindered that rise from being so sensible as it
otherwise would have been in the actual state of tillage.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_728">In plentiful years the bounty, by occasioning an extraordinary<span class="type-margin"><span>A part from its effect in extending tillage, the bounty raises the price of corn, both in times of plenty and of scarcity.</span></span>
 exportation, necessarily raises the price of corn above what it
otherwise would be in those years. To encourage tillage, by keeping up
the price of corn even in the most plentiful years, was the avowed end
of the institution.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_729">In years of great scarcity, indeed, the bounty has generally been suspended. It must, however, have had some effect even<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt547" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt547_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 upon the prices of many of those years. By the extraordinary
exportation which it occasions in years of plenty, it must frequently
hinder the plenty of one year from compensating the scarcity of another.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_730">Both in years of plenty and in years of
scarcity, therefore, the bounty raises the price of corn above what it
naturally would be in the actual state of tillage. If, during the
sixty-four first years of the present century, therefore, the average
price has been lower than during the sixty-four last years of the last
century, it must, in the same state of tillage, have been much more so,
had it not been for this operation of the bounty.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_731">But without the bounty, it may be said, the state of tillage would<span class="type-margin"><span>It is said to have extended tillage (and so to have reduced the price), but the rise of silver has not been peculiar to England.</span></span>
 not have been the same. What may have been the effects of this
institution upon the agriculture of the country, I shall endeavour to
explain hereafter,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt548" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt548_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> when I come to treat particularly of bounties. I shall only observe at present, that this rise in the value of silver, in <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>198<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 proportion to that of corn, has not been peculiar to England. It has
been observed to have taken place in France during the same period, and
nearly in the same proportion too, by three very faithful, diligent, and
 laborious collectors of the prices of corn, Mr. Duprè de St. Maur, Mr.
Messance, and the author of the Essay on the police of grain.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt549" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt549_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 But in France, till 1764, the exportation of grain was by law
prohibited; and it is somewhat difficult to suppose, that nearly the
same diminution of price which took place in one country,
notwithstanding this prohibition, should in another be owing to the
extraordinary encouragement given to exportation.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_732"><span class="type-margin"><span>The alteration should be regarded as a rise of silver rather than a fall of corn.</span></span>It
 would be more proper, perhaps, to consider this variation in the
average money price of corn as the effect rather of some gradual rise in
 the real value of silver in the European market, than of any fall in
the real average value of corn. Corn, it has already been observed,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt550" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt550_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 is at distant periods of time a more accurate measure of value than
either silver, or perhaps any other commodity. When, after the discovery
 of the abundant mines of America, corn rose to three and four times its
 former money price, this change was universally ascribed, not to any
rise in the real value of corn, but to a fall in the real value of
silver. If during the sixty-four first years of the present century,
therefore, the average money price of corn has fallen somewhat below
what it had been during the greater part of the last century, we should
in the same manner impute this change, not to any fall in the real value
 of corn, but to some rise in the real value of silver in the European
market.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_733"><span class="type-margin"><span>The recent high price of corn is merely the effect of unfavourable seasons.</span></span>The high price of corn during these ten or twelve years past, indeed, has occasioned a suspicion<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt551" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt551_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 that the real value of silver still continues to fall in the European
market. This high price of corn, however, seems evidently to have been
the effect of the extraordinary unfavourableness of the seasons, and
ought therefore to be regarded, not as a permanent, but as a transitory
and occasional event. The seasons for these ten or twelve years past
have been unfavourable through the greater part of Europe; and the
disorders of Poland have very much increased the scarcity in all those
countries, which, in dear years, used to be supplied from that market.
So long a course of bad seasons, though not a very common event, is by
no means a singular one; and whoever has enquired much into the history
of the prices of corn in <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>199<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 former times, will be at no loss to recollect several other examples of
 the same kind. Ten years of extraordinary scarcity, besides, are not
more wonderful than ten years of extraordinary plenty. The low price of
corn from 1741 to 1750, both inclusive, may very well be set in
opposition to its high price during these last eight or ten years. From
1741 to 1750, the average price of the quarter of nine bushels of the
best wheat at Windsor market, it appears from the accounts of Eton
College, was only 1 <span class="ital">l.</span> 13 <span class="ital">s.</span> 9 <span class="ital">d.</span> ⅘, which is nearly 6 <span class="ital">s.</span> 3 <span class="ital">d.</span> below the average price of the sixty-four first years of the present century.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt552" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt552_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The average price of the quarter of eight bushels of middle wheat,
comes out, according to this account, to have been, during these ten
years, only 1 <span class="ital">l.</span> 6 <span class="ital">s.</span> 8 <span class="ital">d.</span><a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt553" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt553_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_734">Between 1741 and 1750, however, the bounty must have handered<span class="type-margin"><span>The bounty kept up the price between 1741 and 1750.</span></span>
 the price of corn from falling so low in the home market as it
naturally would have done. During these ten years the quantity of all
sorts of grain exported, it appears from the custom-house books,
amounted to no less than eight millions twenty-nine thousand one hundred
 and fifty-six quarters one bushel. The bounty paid for this amounted to
 1,514,962 <span class="ital">l.</span> 17 <span class="ital">s.</span> 4 <span class="ital">d.</span> ½.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt554" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt554_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> In 1749 accordingly, Mr. Pelham, at that time prime minister, observed to the House of Commons, that for the three years<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt555" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt555_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 preceding, a very extraordinary sum had been paid as bounty for the
exportation of corn. He had good reason to make this observation, and in
 the following year he might have had still better. In that single year
the bounty paid amounted to no less than 324,176 <span class="ital">l.</span> 10 <span class="ital">s.</span> 6 <span class="ital">d.</span><a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt556" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt556_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a> It is unnecessary to observe how much this forced exportation <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>200<span class="bracket">]</span></span> must have raised the price of corn above what it otherwise would have been in the home market.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_735"><span class="type-margin"><span>The sudden change at 1750 was due to accidental variation of the seasons.</span></span>At
 the end of the accounts annexed to this chapter the reader will find
the particular account of those ten years separated from the rest. He
will find there too the particular account of the preceding ten years,
of which the average is likewise below, though not so much below, the
general average of the sixty-four first years of the century. The year
1740, however, was a year of extraordinary scarcity. These twenty years
preceding 1750, may very well be set in opposition to the twenty
preceding 1770. As the former were a good deal below the general average
 of the century, notwithstanding the intervention of one or two dear
years; so the latter have been a good deal above it, notwithstanding the
 intervention of one or two cheap ones, of 1759, for example. If the
former have not been as much below the general average, as the latter
have been above it, we ought probably to impute it to the bounty. The
change has evidently been too sudden to be ascribed to any change in the
 value of silver, which is always slow and gradual. The suddenness of
the effect can be accounted for only by a cause which can operate
suddenly, the accidental variation of the seasons.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_736"><span class="type-margin"><span>The rise in the price of labour has been due to increase of demand for labour, not to a diminution in the value of silver.</span></span>The
 money price of labour in Great Britain has, indeed, risen during the
course of the present century. This, however, seems to be the effect,
not so much of any diminution in the value of silver in the European
market, as of an increase in the demand for labour in Great Britain,
arising from the great, and almost universal prosperity of the country.
In France, a country not altogether so prosperous, the money price of
labour has, since the middle of the last century, been observed to sink
gradually with the average money price of corn. Both in the last century
 and in the present, the day-wages of common labour are there said to
have been pretty uniformly about the twentieth part of the average price
 of the septier of wheat, a measure which contains a little more than
four Winchester bushels. In Great Britain the real recompence of labour,
 it has already been shown,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt557" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt557_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> the real quantities<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt558" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt558_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 of the necessaries and conveniencies of life which are given to the
labourer, has increased considerably during the course of the present
century. The rise in its money price seems to have been the effect, not
of any diminution of the value of silver in the general market of
Europe, but of a rise in the real price of labour in the particular
market of Great Britain, owing to the peculiarly happy circumstances of
the country.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>201<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_737">For some time after the first discovery of America, silver would continue<span class="type-margin"><span>The decrease in the rent and profit of mines of gold and silver</span></span>
 to sell at its former, or not much below its former price. The profits
of mining would for some time be very great, and much above their
natural rate. Those who imported that metal into Europe, however, would
soon find that the whole annual importation could not be disposed of at
this high price. Silver would gradually exchange for a smaller and a
smaller quantity of goods. Its price would sink gradually lower and
lower till it fell to its natural price; or to what was just sufficient
to pay, according to their natural rates, the wages of the labour, the
profits of the stock, and the rent of the land, which must be paid in
order to bring it from the mine to the market. In the greater part of
the silver mines of Peru, the tax of the king of Spain, amounting to a
tenth<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt559" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt559_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> of the gross produce, eats up, it has already been observed,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt560" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt560_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 the whole rent of the land. This tax was originally a half; it soon
afterwards fell to a third, then to a fifth, and at last to a tenth, at
which rate it still continues.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt561" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt561_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 In the greater part of the silver mines of Peru, this, it seems, is all
 that remains, after replacing the stock of the undertaker of the work,
together with its ordinary profits; and it seems to be universally
acknowledged that these profits, which were once very high, are now as
low as they can well be, consistently with carrying on the works.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_738">The tax of the king of Spain was reduced to a fifth part of the registered silver in 1504,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt562" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt562_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> one-and-forty years before 1545,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt563" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt563_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a> the date of the discovery of the mines of Potosi.

 or before 1636, these mines, the most fertile in all America, had time
sufficient to produce their full effect, or to reduce the value of
silver in the European market as low as it could well fall, while it
continued to pay this tax to the king of Spain. Ninety years<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt565" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt565_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">7</a>
 is time sufficient to reduce any commodity, of which there is no
monopoly, to its natural price, or to the lowest price at which, while
it pays a particular tax, it can continue to be sold for any
considerable time together.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_739">The price of silver in the European market might perhaps have fallen<span class="type-margin"><span>has been stayed by the gradual enlargement of the market,</span></span>
 still lower, and it might have become necessary either to reduce the
tax upon it, not only to one tenth, as in 1736, but to one twentieth,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt566" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt566_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">8</a> in the same manner as that upon gold, or to give up working the greater <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>202<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 part of the American mines which are now wrought. The gradual increase
of the demand for silver, or the gradual enlargement of the market for
the produce of the silver mines of America, is probably the cause which
has prevented this from happening, and which has not only kept up the
value of silver in the European market, but has perhaps even raised it
somewhat higher than it was about the middle of the last century.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_740">Since the first discovery of America, the
market for the produce of its silver mines has been growing gradually
more and more extensive.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_741"><span class="type-margin"><span>(1) in Europe,</span></span>First,
 The market of Europe has become gradually more and more extensive.
Since the discovery of America, the greater part of Europe has been much
 improved. England, Holland, France, and Germany; even Sweden, Denmark,
and Russia, have all advanced considerably both in agriculture and in
manufactures. Italy seems not to have gone backwards. The fall of Italy
preceded the conquest of Peru. Since that time it seems rather to have
recovered a little. Spain and Portugal, indeed, are supposed to have
gone backwards. Portugal, however, is but a very small part of Europe,
and the declension of Spain is not, perhaps, so great as is commonly
imagined. In the beginning of the sixteenth century, Spain was a very
poor country, even in comparison with France, which has been so much
improved since that time. It was the well-known remark of the Emperor
Charles V. who had travelled so frequently through both countries, that
every thing abounded in France, but that every thing was wanting in
Spain. The increasing produce of the agriculture and manufactures of
Europe must necessarily have required a gradual increase in the quantity
 of silver coin to circulate it; and the increasing number of wealthy
individuals must have required the like increase in the quantity of
their plate and other ornaments of silver.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_742"><span class="type-margin"><span>(2) in America itself,</span></span>Secondly,
 America is itself a new market for the produce of its own silver mines;
 and as its advances in agriculture, industry, and population, are much
more rapid than those of the most thriving countries in Europe, its
demand must increase much more rapidly. The English colonies are
altogether a new market, which partly for coin and partly for plate,
requires a continually augmenting supply of silver through a great
continent where there never was any demand before. The greater part too
of the Spanish and Portuguese colonies are altogether new markets. New
Granada, the Yucatan, Paraguay, and the Brazils were, before discovered
by the Europeans, inhabited by savage nations, who had neither arts nor
agriculture. A considerable degree of both has now been introduced into
all of them. Even Mexico and Peru, though <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>203<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 they cannot be considered as altogether new markets, are certainly much
 more extensive ones than they ever were before. After all the wonderful
 tales which have been published concerning the splendid state of those
countries in ancient times, whoever reads, with any degree of sober
judgment, the history of their first discovery and conquest, will
evidently discern that, in arts, agriculture, and commerce, their
inhabitants were much more ignorant than the Tartars of the Ukraine are
at present. Even the Peruvians, the more civilized nation of the two,
though they made use of gold and silver as ornaments, had no coined
money of any kind. Their whole commerce was carried on by barter, and
there was accordingly scarce any division of labour among them. Those
who cultivated the ground were obliged to build their own houses, to
make their own houshold furniture, their own clothes, shoes, and
instruments of agriculture. The few artificers among them are said to
have been all maintained by the sovereign, the nobles, and the priests,
and were probably their servants or slaves. All the ancient arts of
Mexico and Peru have never furnished one single manufacture to Europe.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt567" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt567_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The Spanish armies, though they scarce ever exceeded five hundred men,
and frequently did not amount to half that number, found almost
every-where great difficulty in procuring subsistence. The famines which
 they are said to have occasioned almost wherever they went, in
countries too which at the same time are represented as very populous
and well-cultivated, sufficiently demonstrate that the story of this
populousness and high cultivation is in a great measure fabulous. The
Spanish colonies are under a government in many respects less favourable
 to agriculture, improvement and population, than that of the English
colonies.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt568" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt568_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 They seem, however, to be advancing in all these much more rapidly than
 any country in Europe. In a fertile soil and happy climate, the great
abundance and cheapness of land, a circumstance common to all new
colonies, is, it seems, so great an advantage as to compensate many
defects in civil government. Frezier, who visited Peru in 1713,
represents Lima as containing between twenty-five and twenty-eight
thousand inhabitants.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt569" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt569_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> Ulloa, who resided in the same country between 1740 and 1746, represents it as containing more than fifty thousand.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt570" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt570_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> The difference in their accounts of the populousness of several other principal <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>204<span class="bracket">]</span></span> towns in Chili and Peru is nearly the same;<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt571" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt571_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 and as there seems to be no reason to doubt of the good information of
either, it marks an increase which is scarce inferior to that of the
English colonies. America, therefore, is a new market for the produce of
 its own silver mines, of which the demand must increase much more
rapidly than that of the most thriving country in Europe.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_743"><span class="type-margin"><span>and (3) in the East Indies,</span></span>Thirdly,
 The East Indies is another market for the produce of the silver mines
of America, and a market which, from the time of the first discovery of
those mines, has been continually taking off a greater and a greater
quantity of silver. Since that time, the direct trade between America
and the East Indies, which is carried on by means of the Acapulco ships,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt572" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt572_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 has been continually augmenting, and the indirect intercourse by the
way of Europe has been augmenting in a still greater proportion. During
the sixteenth century, the Portuguese were the only European nation who
carried on any regular trade to the East Indies. In the last years of
that century the Dutch began to encroach upon this monopoly, and in a
few years expelled them from their principal settlements in India.
During the greater part of the last century those two nations divided
the most considerable part of the East India trade between them; the
trade of the Dutch continually augmenting in a still greater proportion
than that of the Portuguese declined. The English and French carried on
some trade with India in the last century, but it has been greatly
augmented in the course of the present. The East India trade of the
Swedes and Danes began in the course of the present century. Even the
Muscovites now trade regularly with China by a sort of caravans which go
 over land through Siberia and Tartary to Pekin. The East India trade of
 all these nations, if we except that of the French, which the last war
had well nigh annihilated, has been almost continually augmenting. The
increasing consumption of East India goods in Europe is, it seems, so
great, as to afford a gradual increase of employment to them all. Tea,
for example, was a drug very little used in Europe before the middle of
the last century. At present the value of the tea annually imported by
the English East India Company, for the use of their own countrymen,
amounts to more than a million and a half a year; and even this is not
enough; a great deal more being constantly smuggled into the country <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>205<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 from the ports of Holland, from Gottenburg in Sweden, and from the
coast of France too, as long as the French East India Company was in
prosperity. The consumption of the porcelain of China, of the spiceries
of the Moluccas, of the piece goods of Bengal, and of innumerable other
articles, has increased very nearly in a like proportion. The tonnage
accordingly of all the European shipping employed in the East India
trade, at any one time during the last century, was not, perhaps, much
greater than that of the English East India Company before the late
reduction of their shipping.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt573" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt573_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_744">But in the East Indies, particularly in China and Indostan, the value<span class="type-margin"><span>where the value of gold and silver was, and still is, higher than in Europe</span></span>
 of the precious metals, when the Europeans first began to trade to
those countries, was much higher than in Europe; and it still continues
to be so. In rice countries, which generally yield two, sometimes three
crops in the year, each of them more plentiful than any common crop of
corn, the abundance of food must be much greater than in any corn
country of equal extent. Such countries are accordingly much more
populous. In them too the rich, having a greater super-abundance of food
 to dispose of beyond what they themselves can consume, have the means
of purchasing a much greater quantity of the labour of other people. The
 retinue of a grandee in China or Indostan accordingly is, by all
accounts, much more numerous and splendid than that of the richest
subjects in Europe. The same super-abundance of food, of which they have
 the disposal, enables them to give a greater quantity of it for all
those singular and rare productions which nature furnishes but in very
small quantities; such as the precious metals and the precious stones,
the great objects of the competition of the rich. Though the mines,
therefore, which supplied the Indian market had been as abundant as
those which supplied the European, such commodities would naturally
exchange for a greater quantity of food in India than in Europe. But the
 mines which supplied the Indian market with the precious metals seem to
 have been a good deal less abundant, and those which supplied it with
the precious stones a good deal more so, than the mines which supplied
the European. The precious metals, therefore, would naturally exchange
in India for somewhat a greater quantity of the precious stones, and for
 a much greater quantity of food<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt574" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt574_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> than in <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>206<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 Europe. The money price of diamonds, the greatest of all superfluities,
 would be somewhat lower, and that of food, the first of all
necessaries, a great deal lower in the one country than in the other.
But the real price of labour, the real quantity of the necessaries of
life which is given to the labourer, it has already been observed,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt575" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt575_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 is lower both in China and Indostan, the two great markets of India,
than it is through the greater part of Europe. The wages of the labourer
 will there purchase a smaller quantity of food; and as the money price
of food is much lower in India than in Europe, the money price of labour
 is there lower upon a double account; upon account both of the small
quantity of food which it will purchase, and of the low price of that
food. But in countries of equal art and industry, the money price of the
 greater part of manufactures will be in proportion to the money price
of labour; and in manufacturing art and industry, China and Indostan,
though inferior, seem not to be much inferior to any part of Europe. The
 money price of the greater part of manufactures, therefore, will
naturally be much lower in those great empires than it is any-where in
Europe. Through the greater part of Europe too the expence of
land-carriage increases very much both the real and nominal price of
most manufactures. It costs more labour, and therefore more money, to
bring first the materials, and afterwards the complete manufacture to
market. In China and Indostan the extent and variety of inland
navigations save the greater part of this labour, and consequently of
this money, and thereby reduce still lower both the real and the nominal
 price of the greater part of their manufactures. Upon all these
accounts, the precious metals are a commodity which it always has been,
and still continues to be, extremely advantageous to carry from Europe
to India. There is scarce any commodity which brings a better price
there; or which, in proportion to the quantity of labour and commodities
 which it costs in Europe, will purchase or command a greater quantity
of labour and commodities in India. It is more advantageous too to carry
 silver thither than gold; because in China, and the greater part of the
 other markets of India, the proportion between fine silver and fine
gold is but as ten, or at most as twelve,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt576" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt576_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 to one; whereas in Europe it is as fourteen or fifteen to one. In
China, and the greater part of the other markets of India, ten, or at
most twelve, ounces of silver will purchase an ounce of gold: in Europe
it requires from fourteen to fifteen ounces. In the cargoes, therefore,
of the greater part of European ships which sail to India, silver has <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>207<span class="bracket">]</span></span> generally been one of the most valuable articles.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt577" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt577_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 It is the most valuable article in the Acapulco ships which sail to
Manilla. The silver of the new continent seems in this manner to be one
of the principal commodities<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt578" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt578_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> by which the commerce between the two extremities of the old one is carried on, and it is by means of it, in a great measure,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt579" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt579_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> that those distant parts of the world are connected with one another.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_745">In order to supply so very widely extended a market, the quantity of<span class="type-margin"><span>The supply of silver must provide for waste as well as increase of plate and coin.</span></span>
 silver annually brought from the mines must not only be sufficient to
support that continual increase both of coin and of plate which is
required in all thriving countries; but to repair that continual waste
and consumption of silver which takes place in all countries where that
metal is used.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_746">The continual consumption of the precious metals in coin by wearing,<span class="type-margin"><span>Waste is considerable.</span></span>
 and in plate both by wearing and cleaning, is very sensible; and in
commodities of which the use is so very widely extended, would alone
require a very great annual supply. The consumption of those metals in
some particular manufactures, though it may not perhaps be greater upon
the whole than this gradual consumption, is, however, much more
sensible, as it is much more rapid. In the manufactures of Birmingham
alone, the quantity of gold and silver annually employed in gilding and
plating, and thereby disqualified from ever afterwards appearing in the
shape of those metals, is said to amount to more than fifty thousand
pounds sterling. We may from thence form some notion how great must be
the annual consumption in all the different parts of the world, either
in manufactures of the same kind with those of Birmingham, or in laces,
embroideries, gold and silver stuffs, the gilding of books, furniture,
&amp;c. A considerable quantity too must be annually lost in
transporting those metals from one place to another both by sea and by
land. In the greater part of the governments of Asia, besides, the
almost universal custom of concealing treasures in the bowels of the
earth, of which the knowledge frequently dies with the person who makes
the concealment, must occasion the loss of a still greater quantity.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_747">The quantity of gold and silver imported at both Cadiz and Lisbon<span class="type-margin"><span>Six millions of gold and silver are imported at Cadiz and Lisbon,</span></span>
 (including not only what comes under register, but what may be supposed

 amounted in silver to 1,101,107 pounds weight; and in gold to 49,940
pounds weight. The silver, at sixty-two shillings the pound Troy,
amounts to 3,413,431 <span class="ital">l.</span> 10 <span class="ital">s.</span><a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt583" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt583_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> sterling.

us is exact. He gives us the detail of the particular places from which
the gold and silver were brought, and of the particular quantity of each
 metal, which, according to the register, each of them afforded. He
makes an allowance too for the quantity of each metal which he supposes
may have been smuggled. The great experience of this judicious merchant
renders his opinion of considerable weight.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_749"><span class="type-margin"><span>Raynal,</span></span>According
 to the eloquent and, sometimes, well-informed Author of the
Philosophical and Political History of the establishment of the
Europeans in the two Indies, the annual importation of registered gold
and silver into Spain, at an average of eleven years; viz. from 1754 to
1764, both inclusive; amounted to 13,984,185¾<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt584" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt584_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 piastres of ten reals. On account of what may have been smuggled,
however, the whole annual importation, he supposes, may have amounted to
 seventeen millions of piastres; which, at 4 <span class="ital">s.</span> 6 <span class="ital">d.</span> the piastre, is equal to 3,825,000 <span class="ital">l.</span>
 sterling. He gives the detail too of the particular places from which
the gold and silver were brought, and of the particular quantities of
each metal which, according to the register, each of them afforded.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt585" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt585_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a> He informs us too, that if we were to judge of the quantity of gold <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>209<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 annually imported from the Brazils into Lisbon by the amount of the tax
 paid to the king of Portugal, which it seems is one-fifth of the
standard metal, we might value it at eighteen millions of cruzadoes, or
forty-five millions of French livres, equal to about two millions
sterling. On account of what may have been smuggled, however, we may
safely, he says, add to this sum an eighth more, or 250,000 <span class="ital">l.</span> sterling, so that the whole will amount to 2,250,000 <span class="ital">l.</span> sterling.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt586" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt586_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 According to this account, therefore, the whole annual importation of
the precious metals into both Spain and Portugal, amounts to about
6,075,000 <span class="ital">l.</span> sterling.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_750">Several other very well authenticated, though manuscript,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt587" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt587_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> accounts,<span class="type-margin"><span>and other authors.</span></span>
 I have been assured, agree, in making this whole annual importation
amount at an average to about six millions sterling; sometimes a little
more, sometimes a little less.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_751">The annual importation of the precious metals into Cadiz and Lisbon,<span class="type-margin"><span>This is not the whole of the annual supply, but by far the greater part.</span></span>
 indeed, is not equal to the whole annual produce of the mines of
America. Some part is sent annually by the Acapulco ships to Manilla;
some part is employed in the contraband trade which the Spanish colonies
 carry on with those of other European nations; and some part, no doubt,
 remains in the country. The mines of America, besides, are by no means
the only gold and silver mines in the world. They are, however, by far
the most abundant. The produce of all the other mines which are known,
is insignificant, it is acknowledged, in comparison with theirs; and the
 far greater part of their produce, it is likewise acknowledged, is
annually imported into Cadiz and Lisbon. But the consumption of
Birmingham alone, at the rate of fifty thousand pounds a year,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt588" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt588_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 is equal to the hundred-and-twentieth part of this annual importation
at the rate of six millions a year. The whole annual consumption of gold
 and silver, therefore, in all the different countries of the world
where those metals are used, may perhaps be nearly equal to the whole
annual produce. The remainder may be no more than sufficient to supply
the increasing demand of all thriving countries. It may even have fallen
 so far short of this demand as somewhat to raise the price of those
metals in the European market.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_752">The quantity of brass and iron annually brought from the mine to<span class="type-margin"><span>Brass and iron increase, but we do not expect them to fall in value. Why then gold and silver?</span></span>
 the market is out of all proportion greater than that of gold and
silver. We do not, however, upon this account, imagine that those coarse
 metals are likely to multiply beyond the demand, or to become gradually
 cheaper and cheaper. Why should we imagine that the precious <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>210<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 metals are likely to do so? The coarse metals, indeed, though harder,
are put to much harder uses, and, as they are of less value, less care
is employed in their preservation. The precious metals, however, are not
 necessarily immortal any more than they, but are liable too to be lost,
 wasted, and consumed in a great variety of ways.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_753"><span class="type-margin"><span>In consequence of their durability the metals, especially gold and silver, vary little in value from year to year.</span></span>The
 price of all metals, though liable to slow and gradual variations,
varies less from year to year than that of almost any other part of the
rude produce of land; and the price of the precious metals is even less
liable to sudden variations than that of the coarse ones. The
durableness of metals is the foundation of this extraordinary steadiness
 of price. The corn which was brought to market last year, will be all
or almost all consumed long before the end of this year. But some part
of the iron which was brought from the mine two or three hundred years
ago, may be still in use, and perhaps some part of the gold which was
brought from it two or three thousand years ago. The different masses of
 corn which in different years must supply the consumption of the world,
 will always be nearly in proportion to the respective produce of those
different years. But the proportion between the different masses of iron
 which may be in use in two different years, will be very little
affected by any accidental difference in the produce of the iron mines
of those two years; and the proportion between the masses of gold will
be still less affected by any such difference in the produce of the gold
 mines. Though the produce of the greater part of metallic mines,
therefore, varies, perhaps, still more from year to year than that of
the greater part of corn-fields, those variations have not the same
effect upon the price of the one species of commodities, as upon that of
 the other.</p>

<h2 id="lf0206-01_head_027"><span class="ital">Variations in the Proportion between the respective Values of Gold and Silver</span></h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-01_754"><span class="type-margin"><span>After the discovery of the American mines silver fell in proportion to gold</span></span>BEFORE
 the discovery of the mines of America, the value of fine gold to fine
silver was regulated in the different mints of Europe, between the
proportions of one to ten and one to twelve; that is, an ounce of fine
gold was supposed to be worth from ten to twelve ounces of fine silver.
About the middle of the last century it came to be regulated, between
the proportions of one to fourteen and one to fifteen; that is, an ounce
 of fine gold came to be supposed worth between fourteen and fifteen
ounces of fine silver. Gold rose in its nominal value, or in the
quantity of silver which was given for it. Both metals sunk in their
real value, or in the quantity of labour which they <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>211<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 could purchase; but silver sunk more than gold. Though both the gold
and silver mines of America exceeded in fertility all those which had
ever been known before, the fertility of the silver mines had, it seems,
 been proportionably still greater than that of the gold ones.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_755">The great quantities of silver carried annually from Europe to India,<span class="type-margin"><span>It is higher in the East</span></span>
 have, in some of the English settlements, gradually reduced the value
of that metal in proportion to gold. In the mint of Calcutta, an ounce
of fine gold is supposed to be worth fifteen ounces of fine silver, in
the same manner as in Europe. It is in the mint perhaps rated too high
for the value which it bears in the market of Bengal. In China, the
proportion of gold to silver still continues as one to ten, or one to
twelve.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt589" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt589_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> In Japan, it is said to be as one to eight.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt590" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt590_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_756">The proportion between the quantities of gold and silver annually imported<span class="type-margin"><span>Magens seems to think the proportion of value should be the same as the proportion of quantity,</span></span> into Europe, according to Mr. Meggens’s account, is as one to twenty-two nearly;<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt591" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt591_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 that is, for one ounce of gold there are imported a little more than
twenty-two ounces of silver. The great quantity of silver sent annually
to the East Indies, reduces, he supposes, the quantities of those metals
 which remain in Europe to the proportion of one to fourteen or fifteen,
 the proportion of their values. The proportion between their values, he
 seems to think,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt592" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt592_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 must necessarily be the same as that between their quantities, and
would therefore be as one to twenty-two, were it not for this greater
exportation of silver.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_757">But the ordinary proportion between the respective values of two<span class="type-margin"><span>but this is absurd</span></span>
 commodities is not necessarily the same as that between the quantities
of them which are commonly in the market. The price of an ox, reckoned
at ten guineas, is about threescore times the price of a lamb, reckoned
at 3 <span class="ital">s.</span> 6 <span class="ital">d.</span> It
would be absurd, however, to infer from thence, that there are commonly
in the market threescore lambs for one ox: and it would be just as
absurd to infer, because an ounce of gold will commonly purchase from
fourteen to fifteen ounces of silver, that there are commonly in the
market only fourteen or fifteen ounces of silver for one ounce of gold.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_758">The quantity of silver commonly in the market, it is probable, is<span class="type-margin"><span>The whole of a cheap commodity is commonly worth more than the whole of a dear one, and this is the case with silver and gold.</span></span>
 much greater in proportion to that of gold, than the value of a certain
 quantity of gold is to that of an equal quantity of silver. The whole
quantity of a cheap commodity brought to market, is commonly not only
greater, but of greater value, than the whole quantity of a dear one.
The whole quantity of bread annually brought to <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>212<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 market, is not only greater, but of greater value than the whole
quantity of butcher’s-meat; the whole quantity of butcher’s-meat, than
the whole quantity of poultry; and the whole quantity of poultry, than
the whole quantity of wild fowl. There are so many more purchasers for
the cheap than for the dear commodity, that, not only a greater quantity
 of it, but a greater value, can commonly be disposed of. The whole
quantity, therefore, of the cheap commodity must commonly be greater in
proportion to the whole quantity of the dear one, than the value of a
certain quantity of the dear one, is to the value of an equal quantity
of the cheap one. When we compare the precious metals with one another,
silver is a cheap, and gold a dear commodity. We ought naturally to
expect, therefore, that there should always be in the market, not only a
 greater quantity, but a greater value of silver than of gold. Let any
man, who has a little of both, compare his own silver with his gold
plate, and he will probably find, that, not only the quantity, but the
value of the former greatly exceeds that of the latter. Many people,
besides, have a good deal of silver who have no gold plate, which, even
with those who have it, is generally confined to watch-cases,
snuff-boxes, and such like trinkets, of which the whole amount is seldom
 of great value. In the British coin, indeed, the value of the gold
preponderates greatly, but it is not so in that of all countries. In the
 coin of some countries the value of the two metals is nearly equal. In
the Scotch coin, before the union with England, the gold preponderated
very little, though it did somewhat,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt593" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt593_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 as it appears by the accounts of the mint. In the coin of many
countries the silver preponderates. In France, the largest sums are
commonly paid in that metal, and it is there difficult to get more gold
than what is necessary to carry about in your pocket. The superior
value, however, of the silver plate above that of the gold, which takes
place in all countries, will much more than compensate the preponderancy
 of the gold coin above the silver, which takes place only in some
countries.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_759"><span class="type-margin"><span>Gold is nearer its lowest possible price than silver.</span></span>Though,
 in one sense of the word, silver always has been, and probably always

 dear or cheap, not only according to the absolute greatness or
smallness of its usual price, but according as that price is more or
less above the lowest for which it is possible to bring it to market for
 any considerable time together. This lowest price is that which barely
replaces, with a moderate profit, the stock which must be employed in
bringing the commodity thither. It is the price which affords nothing to
 the landlord, of which rent makes not any component part, but which
resolves itself altogether into wages and profit. But, in the present
state of the Spanish<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt595" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt595_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 market, gold is certainly somewhat nearer to this lowest price than
silver. The tax of the King of Spain upon gold is only one-twentieth
part of the standard metal, or five per cent.; whereas his tax upon
silver amounts to one-tenth part of it, or to ten per cent.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt596" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt596_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> In these taxes too, it has already been observed,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt597" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt597_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 consists the whole rent of the greater part of the gold and silver
mines of Spanish America; and that upon gold is still worse paid than
that upon silver. The profits of the undertakers of gold mines too, as
they more rarely make a fortune, must, in general, be still more
moderate than those of the undertakers of silver mines.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt598" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt598_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> The price of Spanish gold, therefore, as it affords both less rent and less profit, must, in the Spanish<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt599" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt599_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a>

 to bring it thither, than the price of Spanish silver. When all

it; yet the same impossibility of paying it, which in 1736 made it
necessary to reduce it from one-fifth to one-tenth,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt606" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt606_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>

 That the silver mines of Spanish America, like all other mines, become
gradually more expensive in the working, on account of the greater
depths at which it is necessary to carry on the works, and of the
greater expence of drawing out the water and of supplying them with
fresh air at those depths, is acknowledged by every body who has
enquired into the state of those mines.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_762"><span class="type-margin"><span>The greater cost of raising silver must lead to an increase of its price, or a reduction of the tax upon it, or both.</span></span>These
 causes, which are equivalent to a growing scarcity of silver (for a
commodity may be said to grow scarcer when it becomes more difficult and
 expensive to collect a certain quantity of it), must, in time, produce
one or other of the three following events. The increase of the expence
must either, first, be compensated altogether by a proportionable
increase in the price of the metal; or, secondly, it must be compensated
 altogether by a proportionable diminution of the tax upon silver; or,
thirdly, it must be compensated partly by the one, and partly by the
other of those two expedients. This third event is very possible. As
gold rose in its price in proportion to silver, notwithstanding a great
diminution of the tax upon gold; so silver might rise in its price in
proportion to labour and commodities, notwithstanding an equal
diminution of the tax upon silver.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_763"><span class="type-margin"><span>The reduction of the tax in the past makes silver at least 10 per cent. lower than it would otherwise have been.</span></span>Such
 successive reductions of the tax, however, though they may not prevent
altogether, must certainly retard, more or less, the rise of the value
of silver in the European market. In consequence of such reductions,
many mines may be wrought which could not be wrought before, because
they could not afford to pay the old tax; and the quantity of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>215<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 silver annually brought to market must always be somewhat greater, and,
 therefore, the value of any given quantity somewhat less, than it
otherwise would have been. In consequence of the reduction in 1736, the
value of silver in the European market, though it may not at this day be
 lower than before that reduction, is, probably, at least ten per cent.
lower than it would have been, had the Court of Spain continued to exact
 the old tax.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt608" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt608_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_764">That, notwithstanding this reduction, the value of silver has, during<span class="type-margin"><span>Silver has probably risen somewhat in the present century.</span></span>
 the course of the present century, begun to rise somewhat in the
European market, the facts and arguments which have been alleged above,
dispose me to believe, or more properly to suspect and conjecture; for
the best opinion which I can form upon this subject scarce, perhaps,
deserves the name of belief. The rise, indeed, supposing there has been
any, has hitherto<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt609" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt609_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 been so very small, that after all that has been said, it may, perhaps,
 appear to many people uncertain, not only whether this event has
actually taken place; but whether the contrary may not have taken place,
 or whether the value of silver may not still continue to fall in the
European market.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_765">It must be observed, however, that whatever may be the supposed<span class="type-margin"><span>The annual consumption must at length equal the annual importation.</span></span>
 annual importation of gold and silver, there must be a certain period,
at which the annual consumption of those metals will be equal to that
annual importation. Their consumption must increase as their mass
increases, or rather in a much greater proportion. As their mass
increases, their value diminishes. They are more used, and less cared
for, and their consumption consequently increases in a greater
proportion than their mass. After a certain period, therefore, the
annual consumption of those metals must, in this manner, become equal to
 their annual importation, provided that importation is not continually
increasing; which, in the present times, is not supposed to be the case.</p>

 the annual importation should gradually diminish, the annual
consumption may, for some time, exceed the annual importation. The mass
of those metals may gradually and insensibly diminish, and their value
gradually and insensibly rise, till the annual importation becoming
again stationary, the annual consumption will gradually and insensibly
accommodate itself to what that annual importation can maintain.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt610" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt610_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>

 that all sorts of luxuries and curiosities resort to it; not because
they are cheaper there than in poorer countries, but because they are
dearer, or because a better price is given for them. It is the

 Though such commodities, therefore, come to exchange for a greater
quantity of silver than before, it will not from thence follow that
silver has become really cheaper, or will purchase less labour than
before, but that such commodities have become really dearer, or will
purchase more labour than before. It is not their nominal price only,
but their real price which rises in the progress of improvement. The
rise of their nominal price is the effect, not of any degradation of the
 value of silver, but of the rise in their real price.</p>

 which the efficacy of industry is either limited or uncertain. In the
progress of wealth and improvement, the real price of the first may rise
 to any degree of extravagance, and seems not to be limited by any
certain boundary. That of the second, though it may rise greatly, has,
however, a certain boundary beyond which it cannot well pass for any
considerable time together. That of the third, though its natural
tendency is to rise in the progress of improvement, yet in the same
degree of improvement it may sometimes happen even to fall, sometimes to
 continue the same, and sometimes to rise more or less, according as
different accidents render the efforts of human industry, in multiplying
 this sort of rude produce, more or less successful.</p>
<div id="lf0206-01_div_030" class="type-section">
<h2 id="lf0206-01_head_030"><span class="ital">First Sort</span></h2>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_771">The first sort of rude produce of which the price rises in the progress<span class="type-margin"><span>(1) The sort which cannot be multiplied by human industry, such as game.</span></span>
 of improvement, is that which it is scarce in the power of human
industry to multiply at all. It consists in those things which nature
produces only in certain quantities, and which being of a very
perishable nature, it is impossible to accumulate together the produce
of many different seasons. Such are the greater part of rare and
singular birds and fishes, many different sorts of game, almost all
wild-fowl, all birds of passage in particular, as well as many other
things. When wealth and the luxury which accompanies it increase, the
demand for these is likely to increase with them, and no effort of human
 industry may be able to increase the supply much beyond what it was
before this increase of the demand. The quantity of such commodities,
therefore, remaining the same, or nearly the same, while the competition
 to purchase them is continually increasing, their price may rise to any
 degree of extravagance, and seems not to be limited by any certain
boundary. If woodcocks should become so fashionable as to sell for
twenty guineas a-piece, no effort of human industry could increase the
number of those brought to market, much beyond what it is at present.
The high price paid by the Romans, in the time of their greatest
grandeur, for rare birds and fishes, may in this manner easily be
accounted for. These prices were not the effects of the low value of
silver in those times, but of the high value of such rarities and
curiosities as human industry could not multiply at pleasure. The real
value of silver was higher at Rome, for some time before and after the
fall of the republic, than it is through the greater part of Europe at
present. Three sestertii, equal to about sixpence sterling, was the
price which the republic paid for the modius or peck of the tithe <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>218<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 wheat of Sicily. This price, however, was probably below the average
market price, the obligation to deliver their wheat at this rate being
considered as a tax upon the Sicilian farmers. When the Romans,
therefore, had occasion to order more corn than the tithe of wheat
amounted to, they were bound by capitulation to pay for the surplus at
the rate of four sestertii, or eight-pence sterling, the peck;<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt617" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt617_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 and this had probably been reckoned the moderate and reasonable, that
is, the ordinary or average contract price of those times; it is equal
to about one-and-twenty shillings the quarter. Eight-and-twenty
shillings the quarter was, before the late years of scarcity, the
ordinary contract price of English wheat, which in quality is inferior
to the Sicilian, and generally sells for a lower price in the European
market. The value of silver, therefore, in those ancient times, must
have been to its value in the present, as three to four inversely; that
is, three ounces of silver would then have purchased the same quantity
of labour and commodities which four ounces will do at present. When we
read in Pliny, therefore, that Seius<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt618" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt618_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 bought a white nightingale, as a present for the empress Agrippina, at
the price of six thousand sestertii, equal to about fifty pounds of our
present money; and that Asinius Celer<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt619" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt619_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 purchased a surmullet at the price of eight thousand sestertii, equal
to about sixty-six pounds thirteen shillings and fourpence of our
present money; the extravagance of those prices, how much soever it may
surprise us, is apt, notwithstanding, to appear to us about one-third
less than it really was. Their real price, the quantity of labour and
subsistence which was given away for them, was about one-third more than
 their nominal price is apt to express to us in the present times. Seius
 gave for the nightingale the command of a quantity of labour and
subsistence equal to what 66 <span class="ital">l.</span> 13 <span class="ital">s.</span> 4 <span class="ital">d.</span> would purchase in the present times; and Asinius Celer gave for the surmullet the command of a quantity equal to what 88 <span class="ital">l.</span> 17 <span class="ital">s.</span> 9 <span class="ital">d.</span>
 ⅓, would purchase. What occasioned the extravagance of those high
prices was, not so much the abundance of silver, as the abundance of
labour and subsistence, of which those Romans had the disposal, beyond
what was necessary for their own use. The quantity of silver, of which
they had the disposal, was a good deal less than what the command of the
 same quantity of labour and subsistence would have procured to them in
the present times.</p>

 progress of improvement, is that which human industry can multiply in
proportion to the demand. It consists in those useful plants and
animals, which, in uncultivated countries, nature produces with such
profuse abundance, that they are of little or no value, and which, as
cultivation advances, are therefore forced to give place to some more
profitable produce. During a long period in the progress of improvement,
 the quantity of these is continually diminishing, while at the same
time the demand for them is continually increasing. Their real value,
therefore, the real quantity of labour which they will purchase or
command, gradually rises, till at last it gets so high as to render them
 as profitable a produce as any thing else which human industry can
raise upon the most fertile and best cultivated land. When it has got so
 high it cannot well go higher. If it did, more land and more industry
would soon be employed to increase their quantity.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_773">When the price of cattle, for example, rises so high that it is as<span class="type-margin"><span>When it becomes profitable to cultivate land to yield food for cattle, the price of cattle cannot go higher.</span></span>
 profitable to cultivate land in order to raise food for them, as in
order to raise food for man, it cannot well go higher. If it did, more
corn land would soon be turned into pasture. The extension of tillage,
by diminishing the quantity of wild pasture, diminishes the quantity of
butcher’s-meat which the country naturally produces without labour or
cultivation, and by increasing the number of those who have either corn,
 or, what comes to the same thing, the price of corn, to give in
exchange for it, increases the demand. The price of butcher’s-meat,
therefore, and consequently of cattle, must gradually rise till it gets
so high, that it becomes as profitable to employ the most fertile and
best cultivated lands in raising food for them as in raising corn. But
it must always be late in the progress of improvement before tillage can
 be so far extended as to raise the price of cattle to this height; and
till it has got to this height, if the country is advancing at all,
their price must be continually rising. There are, perhaps, some parts
of Europe in which the price of cattle has not yet got to this height.
It had not got to this height in any part of Scotland before the union.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt620" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt620_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Had the Scotch cattle been always confined to the market of Scotland,
in a country in which the quantity of land, which can be applied to no
other purpose but the feeding of cattle, is so great in proportion to
what can be applied to other purposes, it is scarce possible, perhaps,
that their price could ever have risen so high as to render it
profitable to cultivate <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>220<span class="bracket">]</span></span> land for the sake of feeding them. In England, the price of cattle, it has already been observed,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt621" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt621_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 seems, in the neighbourhood of London, to have got to this height about
 the beginning of the last century; but it was much later probably
before it got to it through the greater part of the remoter counties; in
 some of which, perhaps, it may scarce yet have got to it. Of all the
different substances, however, which compose this second sort of rude
produce, cattle is, perhaps, that of which the price, in the progress of
 improvement, first rises to this height.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_774"><span class="type-margin"><span>It must go to this height in order to secure complete cultivation.</span></span>Till
 the price of cattle, indeed, has got to this height, it seems scarce
possible that the greater part, even of those lands which are capable of
 the highest cultivation, can be completely cultivated. In all farms too
 distant from any town to carry manure from it, that is, in the far
greater part of those of every extensive country, the quantity of
well-cultivated land must be in proportion to the quantity of manure
which the farm itself produces; and this again must be in proportion to
the stock of cattle which are maintained upon it. The land is manured
either by pasturing the cattle upon it, or by feeding them in the
stable, and from thence carrying out their dung to it. But unless the
price of the cattle be sufficient to pay both the rent and profit of
cultivated land, the farmer cannot afford to pasture them upon it; and
he can still less afford to feed them in the stable. It is with the
produce of improved and cultivated land only, that cattle can be fed in
the stable; because to collect the scanty and scattered produce of waste
 and unimproved lands would require too much labour and be too
expensive. If the price of the cattle, therefore, is not sufficient to
pay for the produce of improved and cultivated land, when they are
allowed to pasture it, that price will be still less sufficient to pay
for that produce when it must be collected with a good deal of
additional labour, and brought into the stable to them. In these
circumstances, therefore, no more cattle can, with profit, be fed in the
 stable than what are necessary for tillage. But these can never afford
manure enough for keeping constantly in good condition, all the lands
which they are capable of cultivating. What they afford being
insufficient for the whole farm, will naturally be reserved for the
lands to which it can be most advantageously or conveniently applied;
the most fertile, or those, perhaps, in the neighbourhood of the
farm-yard. These, therefore, will be kept constantly in good condition
and fit for tillage. The rest will, the greater part of them, be allowed
 to lie waste, producing scarce any thing but some miserable pasture,
just sufficient to keep alive a a few straggling, half-starved cattle;
the farm, though much understocked <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>221<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 in proportion to what would be necessary for its complete cultivation,
being very frequently overstocked in proportion to its actual produce. A
 portion of this waste land, however, after having been pastured in this
 wretched manner for six or seven years together, may be ploughed up,
when it will yield, perhaps, a poor crop or two of bad oats, or of some
other coarse grain, and then, being entirely exhausted, it must be
rested and pastured again as before, and another portion ploughed up to
be in the same manner exhausted and rested again in its turn. Such
accordingly was the general system of management all over the low
country of Scotland before the union. The lands which were kept
constantly well manured and in good condition, seldom exceeded a third
or a fourth part of the whole farm, and sometimes did not amount to a
fifth or a sixth part of it. The rest were never manured, but a certain
portion of them was in its turn, notwithstanding, regularly cultivated
and exhausted. Under this system of management, it is evident, even that
 part of the lands of Scotland which is capable of good cultivation,
could produce but little in comparison of what it may be capable of
producing. But how disadvantageous soever this system may appear, yet
before the union the low price of cattle seems to have rendered it
almost unavoidable. If, notwithstanding a great rise in their price, it
still continues to prevail through a considerable part of the country,
it is owing, in many places, no doubt, to ignorance and attachment to
old customs, but in most places to the unavoidable obstructions which
the natural course of things opposes to the immediate or speedy
establishment of a better system: first, to the poverty of the tenants,
to their not having yet had time to acquire a stock of cattle sufficient
 to cultivate their lands more completely, the same rise of price which
would render it advantageous for them to maintain a greater stock,
rendering it more difficult for them to acquire it; and, secondly, to
their not having yet had time to put their lands in condition to
maintain this greater stock properly, supposing they were capable of
acquiring it. The increase of stock and the improvement of land are two
events which must go hand in hand, and of which the one can no-where
much out-run the other. Without some increase of stock, there can be
scarce any improvement of land, but there can be no considerable
increase of stock but in consequence of a considerable improvement of
land; because otherwise the land could not maintain it. These natural
obstructions to the establishment of a better system, cannot be removed
but by a long course of frugality and industry; and half a century or a
century more, perhaps, must pass away before the old system, which is
wearing out gradually, can be completely abolished <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>222<span class="bracket">]</span></span> through all the different parts of the country. Of all the commercial<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt622" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt622_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 advantages, however, which Scotland has derived from the union with
England, this rise in the price of cattle is, perhaps, the greatest. It
has not only raised the value of all highland estates, but it has,
perhaps, been the principal cause of the improvement of the low country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_775"><span class="type-margin"><span>Consequently new colonies are poorly cultivated.</span></span>In
 all new colonies the great quantity of waste land, which can for many
years be applied to no other purpose but the feeding of cattle, soon
renders them extremely abundant, and in every thing great cheapness is
the necessary consequence of great abundance. Though all the cattle of
the European colonies in America were originally carried from Europe,
they soon multiplied so much there, and became of so little value, that
even horses were allowed to run wild in the woods without any owner
thinking it worth while to claim them. It must be a long time after the
first establishment of such colonies, before it can become profitable to
 feed cattle upon the produce of cultivated land. The same causes,
therefore, the want of manure, and the disproportion between the stock
employed in cultivation, and the land which it is destined to cultivate,
 are likely to introduce there a system of husbandry not unlike that
which still continues to take place in so many parts of Scotland. Mr.
Kalm, the Swedish traveller, when he gives an account of the husbandry
of some of the English colonies in North America, as he found it in
1749, observes, accordingly, that he can with difficulty discover there
the character of the English nation, so well skilled in all the
different branches of agriculture. They make scarce any manure for their
 corn fields, he says; but when one piece of ground has been exhausted
by continual cropping, they clear and cultivate another piece of fresh
land; and when that is exhausted, proceed to a third. Their cattle are
allowed to wander through the woods and other uncultivated grounds,
where they are half-starved; having long ago extirpated almost all the
annual grasses by cropping them too early in the spring, before they had
 time to form their flowers, or to shed their seeds.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt623" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt623_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 The annual grasses were, it seems, the best natural grasses in that
part of North America; and when the Europeans first settled there, they
used to grow very thick, and to rise three or four feet high. A piece of
 ground which, when he wrote, could not maintain one cow, would in <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>223<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 former times, he was assured, have maintained four, each of which would
 have given four times the quantity of milk which that one was capable
of giving. The poorness of the pasture had, in his opinion, occasioned
the degradation of their cattle, which degenerated sensibly from one
generation to another. They were probably not unlike that stunted breed
which was common all over Scotland thirty or forty years ago, and which
is now so much mended through the greater part of the low country, not
so much by a change of the breed, though that expedient has been
employed in some places, as by a more plentiful method of feeding them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_776">Though it is late, therefore, in the progress of improvement before<span class="type-margin"><span>Cattle are the first of this second sort of rude produce to bring in the price necessary to secure cultivation,</span></span>
 cattle can bring such a price as to render it profitable to cultivate
land for the sake of feeding them; yet of all the different parts which
compose this second sort of rude produce, they are perhaps the first
which bring this price; because till they bring it, it seems impossible
that improvement can be brought near even to that degree of perfection
to which it has arrived in many parts of Europe.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_777">As cattle are among the first, so perhaps venison is among the last<span class="type-margin"><span>and venison is the last;</span></span>
 parts of this sort of rude produce which bring this price. The price of
 venison in Great Britain, how extravagant soever it may appear, is not
near sufficient to compensate the expence of a deer park, as is well
known to all those who have had any experience in the feeding of deer.
If it was otherwise, the feeding of deer would soon become an article of
 common farming; in the same manner as the feeding of those small birds
called Turdi was among the ancient Romans. Varro and Columella assure us
 that it was a most profitable article.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt624" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt624_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The fattening of ortolans, birds of passage which arrive lean in the
country, is said to be so in some parts of France. If venison continues
in fashion, and the wealth and luxury of Great Britain increase as they
have done for some time past, its price may very probably rise still
higher than it is at present.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_778">Between that period in the progress of improvement which brings<span class="type-margin"><span>other things are intermediate,</span></span>
 to its height the price of so necessary an article as cattle, and that
which brings to it the price of such a superfluity as venison, there is a
 very long interval, in the course of which many other sorts of rude
produce gradually arrive at their highest price, some sooner and some
later, according to different circumstances.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_779">Thus in every farm the offals of the barn and stables will maintain a<span class="type-margin"><span>such as poultry,</span></span> certain number of poultry. These, as they are fed with what would <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>224<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 otherwise be lost, are a mere save-all; and as they cost the farmer
scarce any thing, so he can afford to sell them for very little. Almost
all that he gets is pure gain, and their price can scarce be so low as
to discourage him from feeding this number. But in countries ill
cultivated, and, therefore, but thinly inhabited, the poultry, which are
 thus raised without expence, are often fully sufficient to supply the
whole demand. In this state of things, therefore, they are often as
cheap as butcher’s-meat, or any other sort of animal food. But the whole
 quantity of poultry, which the farm in this manner produces without
expence, must always be much smaller than the whole quantity of
butcher’s-meat which is reared upon it; and in times of wealth and
luxury what is rare, with only nearly equal merit, is always preferred
to what is common. As wealth and luxury increase, therefore, in
consequence of improvement and cultivation, the price of poultry
gradually rises above that of butcher’s-meat, till at last it gets so
high that it becomes profitable to cultivate land for the sake of
feeding them. When it has got to this height, it cannot well go higher.
If it did, more land would soon be turned to this purpose. In several
provinces of France, the feeding of poultry is considered as a very
important article in rural œconomy, and sufficiently profitable to
encourage the farmer to raise a considerable quantity of Indian corn and
 buck-wheat for this purpose. A middling farmer will there sometimes
have four hundred fowls in his yard. The feeding of poultry seems scarce
 yet to be generally considered as a matter of so much importance in
England. They are certainly, however, dearer in England than in France,
as England receives considerable supplies from France. In the progress
of improvement, the period at which every particular sort of animal food
 is dearest, must naturally be that which immediately precedes the
general practice of cultivating land for the sake of raising it. For
some time before this practice becomes general, the scarcity must
necessarily raise the price. After it has become general, new methods of
 feeding are commonly fallen upon, which enable the farmer to raise upon
 the same quantity of ground a much greater quantity of that particular
sort of animal food. The plenty not only obliges him to sell cheaper,
but in consequence of these improvements he can afford to sell cheaper;
for if he could not afford it, the plenty would not be of long
continuance. It has been probably in this manner that the introduction
of clover, turnips, carrots, cabbages, &amp;c. has contributed to sink
the common price of butcher’s-meat in the London market somewhat below
what it was about the beginning of the last century.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_780"><span class="type-margin"><span>hogs,</span></span>The hog, that finds his food among ordure, and greedily devours <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>225<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 many things rejected by every other useful animal, is, like poultry,
originally kept as a save-all. As long as the number of such animals,
which can thus be reared at little or no expence, is fully sufficient to
 supply the demand, this sort of butcher’s-meat comes to market at a
much lower price than any other. But when the demand rises beyond what
this quantity can supply, when it becomes necessary to raise food on
purpose for feeding and fattening hogs, in the same manner as for
feeding and fattening other cattle, the price necessarily rises, and
becomes proportionably either higher or lower than that of other
butcher’s-meat, according as the nature of the country, and the state of
 its agriculture, happen to render the feeding of hogs more or less
expensive than that of other cattle. In France, according to Mr. Buffon,
 the price of pork is nearly equal to that of beef.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt625" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt625_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> In most parts of Great Britain it is at present somewhat higher.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_781">The great rise in the price both of hogs and
poultry has in Great Britain been frequently imputed to the diminution
of the number of cottagers and other small occupiers of land; an event
which has in every part of Europe been the immediate forerunner of
improvement and better cultivation, but which at the same time may have
contributed to raise the price of those articles, both somewhat sooner
and somewhat faster than it would otherwise have risen. As the poorest
family can often maintain a cat or a dog, without any expence, so the
poorest occupiers of land can commonly maintain a few poultry, or a sow
and a few pigs, at very little. The little offals of their own table,
their whey, skimmed milk and butter-milk, supply those animals with a
part of their food, and they find the rest in the neighbouring fields
without doing any sensible damage to any body. By diminishing the number
 of those small occupiers, therefore, the quantity of this sort of
provisions which is thus produced at little or no expence, must
certainly have been a good deal diminished, and their price must
consequently have been raised both sooner and faster than it would
otherwise have risen. Sooner or later, however, in the progress of
improvement, it must at any rate have risen to the utmost height to
which it is capable of rising; or to the price which pays the labour and
 expence of cultivating the land which furnishes them with food as well
as these are paid upon the greater part of other cultivated land.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_782">The business of the dairy, like the feeding of hogs and poultry, is<span class="type-margin"><span>milk, butter and cheese.</span></span>
 originally carried on as a save-all. The cattle necessarily kept upon
the farm, produce more milk than either the rearing of their own young, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>226<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 or the consumption of the farmer’s family requires; and they produce
most at one particular season. But of all the productions of land, milk
is perhaps the most perishable. In the warm season, when it is most
abundant, it will scarce keep four-and-twenty hours. The farmer, by
making it into fresh butter, stores a small part of it for a week: by
making it into salt butter, for a year: and by making it into cheese, he
 stores a much greater part of it for several years. Part of all these
is reserved for the use of his own family. The rest goes to market, in
order to find the best price which is to be had, and which can scarce be
 so low as to discourage him from sending thither whatever is over and
above the use of his own family. If it is very low, indeed, he will be
likely to manage his dairy in a very slovenly and dirty manner, and will
 scarce perhaps think it worth while to have a particular room or
building on purpose for it, but will suffer the business to be carried
on amidst the smoke, filth, and nastiness of his own kitchen; as was the
 case of almost all the farmers dairies in Scotland thirty or forty
years ago, and as is the case of many of them still. The same causes
which gradually raise the price of butcher’s-meat, the increase of the
demand, and, in consequence of the improvement of the country, the
diminution of the quantity which can be fed at little or no expence,
raise, in the same manner, that of the produce of the dairy, of which
the price naturally connects with that of butcher’s-meat, or with the
expence of feeding cattle. The increase of price pays for more labour,
care, and cleanliness. The dairy becomes more worthy of the farmer’s
attention, and the quality of its produce gradually improves. The price
at last gets so high that it becomes worth while to employ some of the
most fertile and best cultivated lands in feeding cattle merely for the
purpose of the dairy; and when it has got to this height, it cannot well
 go higher. If it did, more land would soon be turned to this purpose.
It seems to have got to this height through the greater part of England,
 where much good land is commonly employed in this manner. If you except
 the neighbourhood of a few considerable towns, it seems not yet to have
 got to this height anywhere in Scotland, where common farmers seldom
employ much good land in raising food for cattle merely for the purpose
of the dairy. The price of the produce, though it has risen very
considerably within these few years, is probably still too low to admit
of it. The inferiority of the quality, indeed, compared with that of the
 produce of English dairies, is fully equal to that of the price. But
this inferiority of quality is, perhaps, rather the effect of this
lowness of price than the cause of it. Though the quality was much
better, the greater part of what is brought to market could not, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>227<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 I apprehend, in the present circumstances of the country, be disposed
of at a much better price; and the present price, it is probable, would
not pay the expence of the land and labour necessary for producing a
much better quality. Through the greater part of England,
notwithstanding the superiority of price, the dairy is not reckoned a
more profitable employment of land than the raising of corn, or the
fattening of cattle, the two great objects of agriculture. Through the
greater part of Scotland, therefore, it cannot yet be even so
profitable.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_783">The lands of no country, it is evident, can ever be completely cultivated<span class="type-margin"><span>The rise of price, being necessary for good cultivation, should be regarded with satisfaction.</span></span>
 and improved, till once the price of every produce, which human
industry is obliged to raise upon them, has got so high as to pay for
the expence of complete improvement and cultivation. In order to do
this, the price of each particular produce must be sufficient, first, to
 pay the rent of good corn land, as it is that which regulates the rent
of the greater part of other cultivated land; and secondly, to pay the
labour and expence of the farmer as well as they are commonly paid upon
good corn-land; or, in other words, to replace with the ordinary profits
 the stock which he employs about it. This rise in the price of each
particular produce, must evidently be previous to the improvement and
cultivation of the land which is destined for raising it. Gain is the
end of all improvement, and nothing could deserve that name of which
loss was to be the necessary consequence. But loss must be the necessary
 consequence of improving land for the sake of a produce of which the
price could never bring back the expence. If the complete improvement
and cultivation of the country be, as it most certainly is, the greatest
 of all public advantages, this rise in the price of all those different
 sorts of rude produce, instead of being considered as a public
calamity, ought to be regarded as the necessary forerunner and attendant
 of the greatest of all public advantages.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_784">This rise too in the nominal or money-price of all those different<span class="type-margin"><span>It is due not to a fall of silver but to a rise in the real price of the produce.</span></span>
 sorts of rude produce has been the effect, not of any degradation in
the value of silver, but of a rise in their real price. They have become
 worth, not only a greater quantity of silver, but a greater quantity of
 labour and subsistence than before. As it costs a greater quantity of
labour and subsistence to bring them to market, so when they are brought
 thither, they represent or are equivalent to a greater quantity.</p>

 third and last sort of rude produce, of which the price naturally rises
 in the progress of improvement, is that in which the efficacy of human
industry, in augmenting the quantity, is either limited or uncertain.
Though the real price of this sort of rude produce, therefore, naturally
 tends to rise in the progress of improvement, yet, according as
different accidents happen to render the efforts of human industry more
or less successful in augmenting the quantity, it may happen sometimes
even to fall, sometimes to continue the same in very different periods
of improvement, and sometimes to rise more or less in the same period.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_786"><span class="type-margin"><span><span class="ital">e.g.</span> wool and hides, which are appendages to other sorts of produce.</span></span>There
 are some sorts of rude produce which nature has rendered a kind of
appendages to other sorts; so that the quantity of the one which any
country can afford, is necessarily limited by that of the other. The
quantity of wool or of raw hides, for example, which any country can
afford, is necessarily limited by the number of great and small cattle
that are kept in it. The state of its improvement, and the nature of its
 agriculture, again necessarily determine this number.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_787"><span class="type-margin"><span>Wool and hides in early times have a larger market open to them than butcher’s-meat.</span></span>The
 same causes, which, in the progress of improvement, gradually raise the
 price of butcher’s-meat, should have the same effect, it may be
thought, upon the prices of wool and raw hides, and raise them too
nearly in the same proportion. It probably would be so, if in the rude
beginnings of improvement the market for the latter commodities was
confined within as narrow bounds as that for the former. But the extent
of their respective markets is commonly extremely different.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_788">The market for butcher’s-meat is almost
every-where confined to the country which produces it. Ireland, and some
 part of British America indeed, carry on a considerable trade in salt
provisions; but they are, I believe, the only countries in the
commercial world which do so, or which export to other countries any
considerable part of their butcher’s-meat.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_789">The market for wool and raw hides, on the
contrary, is in the rude beginnings of improvement very seldom confined
to the country which produces them. They can easily be transported to
distant countries, wool without any preparation, and raw hides with very
 little: and as they are the materials of many manufactures, the
industry of other countries may occasion a demand for them, though that
of the country which produces them might not occasion any.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_790"><span class="type-margin"><span>In thinly inhabited countries the wool and hide are more valuable in proportion to the carcase.</span></span>In
 countries ill cultivated, and therefore but thinly inhabited, the price
 of the wool and the hide bears always a much greater proportion <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>229<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 to that of the whole beast, than in countries where, improvement and
population being further advanced, there is more demand for
butcher’s-meat. Mr. Hume observes, that in the Saxon times, the fleece
was estimated at two-fifths of the value of the whole sheep, and that
this was much above the proportion of its present estimation.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt626" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt626_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 In some provinces of Spain, I have been assured, the sheep is
frequently killed merely for the sake of the fleece and the tallow. The
carcase is often left to rot upon the ground, or to be devoured by
beasts and birds of prey. If this sometimes happens even in Spain, it
happens almost constantly in Chili, at Buenos Ayres,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt627" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt627_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 and in many other parts of Spanish America, where the horned cattle are
 almost constantly killed merely for the sake of the hide and the
tallow. This too used to happen almost constantly in Hispaniola, while
it was infested by the Buccaneers, and before the settlement,
improvement, and populousness of the French plantations (which now
extend round the coast of almost the whole western half of the island)
had given some value to the cattle of the Spaniards, who still continue
to possess, not only the eastern part of the coast, but the whole inland
 and mountainous part of the country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_791">Though in the progress of improvement and population, the price<span class="type-margin"><span>In the progress of improvement the wool and hide should rise, though not so much as the carcase</span></span>
 of the whole beast necessarily rises, yet the price of the carcase is
likely to be much more affected by this rise than that of the wool and
the hide. The market for the carcase, being in the rude state of society
 confined always to the country which produces it, must necessarily be
extended in proportion to the improvement and population of that
country. But the market for the wool and the hides even of a barbarous
country often extending to the whole commercial world, it can very
seldom be enlarged in the same proportion. The state of the whole
commercial world can seldom be much affected by the improvement of any
particular country; and the market for such commodities may remain the
same, or very nearly the same, after such improvements, as before. It
should, however, in the natural course of things rather upon the whole
be somewhat extended in consequence of them. If the manufactures,
especially, of which those commodities are the materials, should ever
come to flourish in the country, the market, though it might not be much
 enlarged, would at least be brought much nearer to the place of growth
than before; and the price of those materials might at least be
increased by what had usually been the expence of transporting them to
distant countries. Though it <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>230<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 might not rise therefore in the same proportion as that of
butcher’s-meat, it ought naturally to rise somewhat, and it ought
certainly not to fall.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_792"><span class="type-margin"><span>But in England wool has fallen since 1339.</span></span>In
 England, however, notwithstanding the flourishing state of its woollen
manufacture, the price of English wool has fallen very considerably
since the time of Edward III. There are many authentic records which
demonstrate that during the reign of that prince (towards the middle of
the fourteenth century, or about 1339) what was reckoned the moderate
and reasonable price of the tod or twenty-eight pounds of English wool
was not less than ten shillings of the money of those times,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt628" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt628_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 containing, at the rate of twenty-pence the ounce, six ounces of silver
 Tower-weight, equal to about thirty shillings of our present money. In
the present times, one-and-twenty shillings the tod may be reckoned a
good price for very good English wool. The money-price of wool,
therefore, in the time of Edward III, was to its money-price in the
present times as ten to seven. The superiority of its real price was
still greater. At the rate of six shillings and eight-pence the quarter,
 ten shillings was in those ancient times the price of twelve bushels of
 wheat. At the rate of twenty-eight shillings the quarter,
one-and-twenty shillings is in the present times the price of six
bushels only. The proportion between the real prices of ancient and
modern times, therefore, is as twelve to six, or as two to one. In those
 ancient times a tod of wool would have purchased twice the quantity of
subsistence which it will purchase at present; and consequently twice
the quantity of labour, if the real recompence of labour had been the
same in both periods.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_793"><span class="type-margin"><span>This has been caused by artificial regulations.</span></span>This
 degradation both in the real and nominal value of wool, could never
have happened in consequence of the natural course of things. It has
accordingly been the effect of violence and artifice: First, of the
absolute prohibition of exporting wool from England;<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt629" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt629_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> Secondly, of the permission of importing it from Spain<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt630" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt630_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 duty free; Thirdly, of the prohibition of exporting it from Ireland to
any other country but England. In consequence of these regulations, the
market for English wool, instead of being somewhat extended in
consequence of the improvement of England, has been confined to the home
 market, where the wool of several other countries<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt631" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt631_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> is allowed to come into <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>231<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 competition with it, and where that of Ireland is forced into
competition with it. As the woollen manufactures too of Ireland are
fully as much discouraged as is consistent with justice and fair
dealing, the Irish can work up but a small part of their own wool at
home, and are, therefore, obliged to send a greater proportion of it to
Great Britain, the only market they are allowed.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_794">I have not been able to find any such authentic records concerning<span class="type-margin"><span>The real price of hides at present is somewhat lower than in the fifteenth century,</span></span>
 the price of raw hides in ancient times. Wool was commonly paid as a
subsidy to the king, and its valuation in that subsidy ascertains, at
least in some degree, what was its ordinary price. But this seems not to
 have been the case with raw hides. Fleetwood, however, from an account
in 1425, between the prior of Burcester Oxford and one of his canons,
gives us their price, at least as it was stated, upon that particular
occasion; viz. five ox hides at twelve shillings; five cow hides at
seven shillings and three pence; thirty-six sheep skins of two years old
 at nine shillings; sixteen calves skins at two shillings.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt632" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt632_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 In 1425, twelve shillings contained about the same quantity of silver
as four-and-twenty shillings of our present money. An ox hide,
therefore, was in this account valued at the same quantity of silver as 4
 <span class="ital">s.</span> ⅘ths of our present money. Its nominal
price was a good deal lower than at present. But at the rate of six
shillings and eight-pence the quarter, twelve shillings would in those
times have purchased fourteen bushels and four-fifths of a bushel of
wheat, which, at three and six-pence the bushel, would in the present
times cost 51 <span class="ital">s.</span> 4 <span class="ital">d.</span>
 An ox hide, therefore, would in those times have purchased as much corn
 as ten shillings and three-pence would purchase at present. Its real
value was equal to ten shillings and three-pence of our present money.
In those ancient times, when the cattle were half starved during the
greater part of the winter, we cannot suppose that they were of a very
large size. An ox hide which weighs four stone of sixteen pounds
averdupois, is not in the present times reckoned a bad one; and in those
 ancient times would probably have been reckoned a very good one. But at
 half a crown the stone, which at this moment (February 1773) I
understand to be the common price, such a hide would at present cost
only ten shillings. Though its nominal price, therefore, is higher in
the present than it was in those ancient times, its real price, the real
 quantity of subsistence which it will purchase or command, is rather
somewhat lower. The price of cow hides, as stated in the above account,
is nearly in the common proportion to that of ox hides. That of sheep <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>232<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 skins is a good deal above it. They had probably been sold with the
wool. That of calves skins, on the contrary, is greatly below it. In
countries where the price of cattle is very low, the calves, which are
not intended to be reared in order to keep up the stock, are generally
killed very young; as was the case in Scotland twenty or thirty years
ago. It saves the milk, which their price would not pay for. Their
skins, therefore, are commonly good for little.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_795"><span class="type-margin"><span>but their average price during the present century is probably higher.</span></span>The
 price of raw hides is a good deal lower at present than it was a few
years ago; owing probably to the taking off the duty upon seal skins,
and to the allowing, for a limited time, the importation of raw hides
from Ireland and from the plantations duty free, which was done in 1769.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt633" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt633_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Take the whole of the present century at an average, their real price
has probably been somewhat higher than it was in those ancient times.
The nature of the commodity renders it not quite so proper for being
transported to distant markets as wool. It<span class="type-margin"><span>They are not so easily transported as wool,</span></span>
 suffers more by keeping. A salted hide is reckoned inferior to a fresh
one, and sells for a lower price. This circumstance must necessarily
have some tendency to sink the price of raw hides produced in a country
which does not manufacture them, but is obliged to export them; and
comparatively to raise that of those produced in a country which does
manufacture them. It must have some tendency to sink their price in a
barbarous, and to raise it in an improved and manufacturing country. It
must have had some tendency therefore to sink<span class="type-margin"><span>and tanners have not been so much favoured by legislation as clothiers</span></span>
 it in ancient, and to raise it in modern times. Our tanners besides
have not been quite so successful as our clothiers, in convincing the
wisdom of the nation, that the safety of the commonwealth depends upon
the prosperity of their particular manufacture. They have accordingly
been much less favoured. The exportation of raw hides has, indeed, been
prohibited, and declared a nuisance:<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt634" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt634_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> but their importation from foreign countries has been subjected to a duty;<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt635" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt635_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 and though this duty has been taken off from those of Ireland and the
plantations (for the limited time of five years only), yet Ireland has
not been confined to the market of Great Britain for the sale of its
surplus hides, or of those which are not manufactured at home. The hides
 of common cattle have but within these few years been put among the
enumerated commodities which the plantations can send <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>233<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 no-where but to the mother country; neither has the commerce of Ireland
 been in this case oppressed hitherto, in order to support the
manufactures of Great Britain.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_796">Whatever regulations tend to sink the price either of wool or of<span class="type-margin"><span>Regulations which sink the price of wool or hides in an improve country raise the price of meat,</span></span>
 raw hides below what it naturally would be, must, in an improved and
cultivated country, have some tendency to raise the price of
butcher’s-meat. The price both of the great and small cattle, which are
fed on improved and cultivated land, must be sufficient to pay the rent
which the landlord, and the profit which the farmer has reason to expect
 from improved and cultivated land. If it is not, they will soon cease
to feed them. Whatever part of this price, therefore, is not paid by the
 wool and the hide, must be paid by the carcase. The less there is paid
for the one, the more must be paid for the other. In what manner this
price is to be divided upon the different parts of the beast, is
indifferent to the landlords and farmers, provided it is all paid to
them. In an improved and cultivated country, therefore, their interest
as landlords and farmers cannot be much affected by such regulations,
though their interest as consumers may, by the rise in the price of
provisions.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt636" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt636_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> It would be quite otherwise, however, in an unimproved and uncultivated<span class="type-margin"><span>but not in an unimproved country.</span></span>
 country, where the greater part of the lands could be applied to no
other purpose but the feeding of cattle, and where the wool and the hide
 made the principal part of the value of those cattle. Their interest as
 landlords and farmers would in this case be very deeply affected by
such regulations, and their interest as consumers very little. The fall
in the price of the wool and the hide, would not in this case raise the
price of the carcase; because the greater part of the lands of the
country being applicable to no other purpose but the feeding of cattle,
the same number would still continue to be fed. The same quantity of
butcher’s-meat would still come to market. The demand for it would be no
 greater than before. Its price, therefore, would be the same as before.
 The whole price of cattle would fall, and along with it both the rent
and the profit of all those lands of which cattle was the principal
produce, that is, of the greater part of the lands of the country. The
perpetual prohibition of the exportation of wool, which is commonly, but
 very falsely, ascribed to Edward III,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt637" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt637_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 would, in the then circumstances of the country, have been the most
destructive regulation which could well have been thought of. It would
not <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>234<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 only have reduced the actual value of the greater part of the lands of
the kingdom, but by reducing the price of the most important species of
small cattle, it would have retarded very much its subsequent
improvement.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_797"><span class="type-margin"><span>The Union sank the price of Scotch wool, while it raised the price of Scotch meat.</span></span>The
 wool of Scotland fell very considerably in its price in consequence of
the union with England, by which it was excluded from the great market
of Europe, and confined to the narrow one of Great Britain. The value of
 the greater part of the lands in the southern counties of Scotland,
which are chiefly a sheep country, would have been very deeply affected
by this event, had not the rise in the price of butcher’s-meat fully
compensated the fall in the price of wool.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_798"><span class="type-margin"><span>The efficacy of industry in increasing wool and hides is both limited and uncertain.</span></span>As
 the efficacy of human industry, in increasing the quantity either of
wool or of raw hides, is limited, so far as it depends upon the produce
of the country where it is exerted; so it is uncertain so far as it
depends upon the produce of other countries. It so far depends, not so
much upon the quantity which they produce, as upon that which they do
not manufacture; and upon the restraints which they may or may not think
 proper to impose upon the exportation of this sort of rude produce.
These circumstances, as they are altogether independent of domestic
industry, so they necessarily render the efficacy of its efforts more or
 less uncertain. In multiplying this sort of rude produce, therefore,
the efficacy of human industry is not only limited, but uncertain.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_799"><span class="type-margin"><span>The same thing is true of fish, which naturally rise in the progress of improvement</span></span>In
 multiplying another very important sort of rude produce, the quantity
of fish that is brought to market, it is likewise both limited and
uncertain. It is limited by the local situation of the country, by the
proximity or distance of its different provinces from the sea, by the
number of its lakes and rivers, and by what may be called the fertility
or barrenness of those seas, lakes and rivers, as to this sort of rude
produce. As population increases, as the annual produce of the land and
labour of the country grows greater and greater, there come to be more
buyers of fish, and those buyers too have a greater quantity and variety
 of other goods, or, what is the same thing, the price of a greater
quantity and variety of other goods, to buy with. But it will generally
be impossible to supply the great and extended market without employing a
 quantity of labour greater than in proportion to what had been
requisite for supplying the narrow and confined one. A market which,
from requiring only one thousand, comes to require annually ten thousand
 ton of fish, can seldom be supplied without employing more than ten
times the quantity of labour which had before been sufficient to supply
it. The fish must generally be sought for at <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>235<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 a greater distance, larger vessels must be employed, and more expensive
 machinery of every kind made use of. The real price of this commodity,
therefore, naturally rises in the progress of improvement. It has
accordingly done so, I believe, more or less in every country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_800">Though the success of a particular day’s fishing may be a very uncertain<span class="type-margin"><span>The connexion of success in fishing with the state of improvement is uncertain.</span></span>
 matter, yet, the local situation of the country being supposed, the
general efficacy of industry in bringing a certain quantity of fish to
market, taking the course of a year, or of several years together, it
may perhaps be thought, is certain enough; and it, no doubt, is so. As
it depends more, however, upon the local situation of the country, than
upon the state of its wealth and industry; as upon this account it may
in different countries be the same in very different periods of
improvement, and very different in the same period; its connection with
the state of improvement is uncertain, and it is of this sort of
uncertainty that I am here speaking.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_801">In increasing the quantity of the different minerals and metals which<span class="type-margin"><span>In increasing minerals the efficacy of industry is not limited but uncertain.</span></span>
 are drawn from the bowels of the earth, that of the more precious ones
particularly, the efficacy of human industry seems not to be limited,
but to be altogether uncertain.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_802">The quantity of the precious metals which is
to be found in any country is not limited by any thing in its local
situation, such as the fertility or barrenness of its own mines.<span class="type-margin"><span>The quantity of the precious metals in a country depends on its power of purchasing and the fertility of the mines.</span></span>
 Those metals frequently abound in countries which possess no mines.
Their quantity in every particular country seems to depend upon two
different circumstances; first, upon its power of purchasing, upon the
state of its industry, upon the annual produce of its land and labour,
in consequence of which it can afford to employ a greater or a smaller
quantity of labour and subsistence in bringing or purchasing such
superfluities as gold and silver, either from its own mines or from
those of other countries; and, secondly, upon the fertility or
barrenness of the mines which may happen at any particular time to
supply the commercial world with those metals. The quantity of those
metals in the countries most remote from the mines, must be more or less
 affected by this fertility or barrenness, on account of the easy and
cheap transportation of those metals, of their small bulk and great
value. Their quantity in China and Indostan must have been more or less
affected by the abundance of the mines of America.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_803">So far as their quantity in any particular country depends upon the<span class="type-margin"><span>So far as it depends on the former circumstance the real price is likely to rise with improvement;</span></span>
 former of those two circumstances (the power of purchasing), their real
 price, like that of all other luxuries and superfluities, is likely to
rise with the wealth and improvement of the country, and to fall with
its <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>236<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 poverty and depression. Countries which have a great quantity of labour
 and subsistence to spare, can afford to purchase any particular
quantity of those metals at the expence of a greater quantity of labour
and subsistence, than countries which have less to spare.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_804"><span class="type-margin"><span>so far as it depends on the latter circumstance the real price will vary with the fertility of the mines,</span></span>So
 far as their quantity in any particular country depends upon the latter
 of those two circumstances (the fertility or barrenness of the mines
which happen to supply the commercial world) their real price, the real
quantity of labour and subsistence which they will purchase or exchange
for, will, no doubt, sink more or less in proportion to the fertility,
and rise in proportion to the barrenness, of those mines.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_805"><span class="type-margin"><span>which has no connexion with the state of industry.</span></span>The
 fertility or barrenness of the mines, however, which may happen at any
particular time to supply the commercial world, is a circumstance which,
 it is evident, may have no sort of connection with the state of
industry in a particular country. It seems even to have no very
necessary connection with that of the world in general. As arts and
commerce, indeed, gradually spread themselves over a greater and a
greater part of the earth, the search for new mines, being extended over
 a wider surface, may have somewhat a better chance for being
successful, than when confined within narrower bounds. The discovery of
new mines, however, as the old ones come to be gradually exhausted, is a
 matter of the greatest uncertainty, and such as no human skill or
industry can ensure. All indications, it is acknowledged, are doubtful,
and the actual discovery and successful working of a new mine can alone
ascertain the reality of its value, or even of its existence. In this
search there seem to be no certain limits either to the possible
success, or to the possible disappointment of human industry. In the
course of a century or two, it is possible that new mines may be
discovered more fertile than any that have ever yet been known; and it
is just equally possible that the most fertile mine then known may be
more barren than any that was wrought before the discovery of the mines
of America. Whether the one or the other of those two events may happen
to take place, is of very little importance to the real wealth and
prosperity of the world, to the real value of the annual produce of the
land and labour of mankind. Its nominal value, the quantity of gold and
silver by which this annual produce could be expressed or represented,
would, no doubt, be very different; but its real value, the real
quantity of labour which it could purchase or command, would be
precisely the same. A shilling might in the one case represent no more
labour than a penny does at present; and a penny in the other might
represent as much as a shilling does now. But in the one case he who had
 a shilling in his pocket, would be no <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>237<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 richer than he who has a penny at present; and in the other he who had a
 penny would be just as rich as he who has a shilling now. The cheapness
 and abundance of gold and silver plate, would be the sole advantage
which the world could derive from the one event, and the dearness and
scarcity of those trifling superfluities the only inconveniency it could
 suffer from the other.</p>

<h2 id="lf0206-01_head_033"><span class="ital">Conclusion of the Digression concerning the Variations in the Value of Silver</span></h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-01_806">THE greater part of the writers who have collected the money prices<span class="type-margin"><span>The high value of the precious metals is no proof of poverty and barbarism,</span></span>
 of things in ancient times, seem to have considered the low money price
 of corn, and of goods in general, or, in other words, the high value of
 gold and silver, as a proof, not only of the scarcity of those metals,
but of the poverty and barbarism of the country at the time when it took
 place. This notion is connected with the system of political œconomy
which represents national wealth as consisting in the abundance, and
national poverty in the scarcity, of gold and silver; a system which I
shall endeavour to explain and examine at great length in the fourth
book of this enquiry. I shall only observe at present, that the high
value of the precious metals can be no proof of the poverty or barbarism
 of any particular country at the time when it took place. It is a proof
 only of the barrenness of the mines which happened at that time to
supply the commercial world. A poor country, as it cannot afford to buy
more, so it can as little afford to pay dearer for gold and silver than a
 rich one; and the value of those metals, therefore, is not likely to be
 higher in the former than in the latter. In China, a country much
richer than any part of Europe,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt638" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt638_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 the value of the precious metals is much higher than in any part of
Europe. As the wealth of Europe, indeed, has increased greatly since the
 discovery of the mines of America, so the value of gold and silver has
gradually diminished. This diminution of their value, however, has not
been owing to the increase of the real wealth of Europe, of the annual
produce of its land and labour, but to the accidental discovery of more
abundant mines than any that were known before. The increase of the
quantity of gold and silver in Europe, and the increase of its
manufactures and agriculture, are two events which, though they have
happened nearly about the same time, yet have arisen from very different
 causes, and have scarce any natural connection with one <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>238<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 another. The one has arisen from a mere accident, in which neither
prudence nor policy either had or could have any share: The other from
the fall of the feudal system, and from the establishment of a
government which afforded to industry the only encouragement which it
requires, some tolerable security that it shall enjoy the fruits of its
own labour. Poland, where the feudal system still continues to take
place, is at this day as beggarly a country as it was before the
discovery of America. The money price of corn, however, has risen; the
real value of the precious metals has fallen in Poland, in the same
manner as in other parts of Europe. Their quantity, therefore, must have
 increased there as in other places, and nearly in the same proportion
to the annual produce of its land and labour. This increase of the
quantity of those metals, however, has not, it seems, increased that
annual produce, has neither improved the manufactures and agriculture of
 the country, nor mended the circumstances of its inhabitants. Spain and
 Portugal, the countries which possess the mines, are, after Poland,
perhaps, the two most beggarly countries in Europe. The value of the
precious metals, however, must be lower in Spain and Portugal than in
any other part of Europe; as they come from those countries to all other
 parts of Europe, loaded, not only with a freight and an insurance, but
with the expence of smuggling, their exportation being either
prohibited, or subjected to a duty. In proportion to the annual produce
of the land and labour, therefore, their quantity must be greater in
those countries than in any other part of Europe: Those countries,
however, are poorer than the greater part of Europe. Though the feudal
system has been abolished in Spain and Portugal, it has not been
succeeded by a much better.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_807">As the low value of gold and silver,
therefore, is no proof of the wealth and flourishing state of the
country where it takes place; so neither is their high value, or the low
 money price either of goods in general, or of corn in particular, any
proof of its poverty and barbarism.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_808"><span class="type-margin"><span>but the low price of cattle, poultry, game, &amp;c., is a proof of poverty or barbarism.</span></span>But
 though the low money price either of goods in general, or of corn in
particular, be no proof of the poverty or barbarism of the times, the
low money price of some particular sorts of goods, such as cattle,
poultry, game of all kinds, &amp;c.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt639" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt639_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 in proportion to that of corn, is a most decisive one. It clearly
demonstrates, first, their great abundance in proportion to that of
corn, and consequently the great extent of the land which they occupied
in proportion to what was occupied by corn; and, secondly, the low value
 of this land in proportion to that of corn land, and consequently the
uncultivated and unimproved state of the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>239<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 far greater part of the lands of the country. It clearly demonstrates
that the stock and population of the country did not bear the same
proportion to the extent of its territory, which they commonly do in
civilized countries, and that society was at that time, and in that
country, but in its infancy. From the high or low money price either of
goods in general, or of corn in particular, we can infer only that the
mines which at that time happened to supply the commercial world with
gold and silver, were fertile or barren, not that the country was rich
or poor. But from the high or low money price of some sorts of goods in
proportion to that of others, we can infer, with a degree of probability
 that approaches almost to certainty, that it was rich or poor, that the
 greater part of its lands were improved or unimproved, and that it was
either in a more or less barbarous state, or in a more or less civilized
 one.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_809">Any rise in the money price of goods which proceeded altogether<span class="type-margin"><span>A
 rise of price due entirely to degradation of silver would affect all
goods equally, but corn has risen much less than other provisions,</span></span>
 from the degradation of the value of silver, would affect all sorts of
goods equally, and raise their price universally a third, or a fourth,
or a fifth part higher, according as silver happened to lose a third, or
 a fourth, or a fifth part of its former value.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt640" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt640_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 But the rise in the price of provisions, which has been the subject of
so much reasoning and conversation, does not affect all sorts of
provisions equally. Taking the course of the present century at an
average, the price of corn, it is acknowledged, even by those who
account for this rise by the degradation of the value of silver, has
risen much less than that of some other sorts of provisions. The rise in
 the price of those other sorts of provisions, therefore, cannot be
owing altogether to the degradation of the value of silver. Some other
causes must be taken into the account, and those which have been above
assigned, will, perhaps, without having recourse to the supposed
degradation of the value of silver, sufficiently explain this rise in
those particular sorts of provisions of which the price has actually
risen in proportion to that of corn.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_810">As to the price of corn itself, it has, during the sixty-four first years<span class="type-margin"><span>and has indeed been somewhat lower in 1701-64 than in 1637-1700,</span></span>
 of the present century, and before the late extraordinary course of bad
 seasons, been somewhat lower than it was during the sixty-four last
years of the preceding century. This fact is attested, not only by the
accounts of Windsor market,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt641" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt641_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> but by the public fiars<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt642" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt642_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 of all the different counties of Scotland, and by the accounts of
several different markets in France, which have been collected with
great diligence and fidelity <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>240<span class="bracket">]</span></span> by Mr. Messance,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt643" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt643_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> and by Mr. Duprè de St. Maur.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt644" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt644_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 The evidence is more complete than could well have been expected in a
matter which is naturally so very difficult to be ascertained.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_811"><span class="type-margin"><span>while its recent high price has been due only to bad seasons.</span></span>As
 to the high price of corn during these last ten or twelve years, it can
 be sufficiently accounted for from the badness of the seasons, without
supposing any degradation in the value of silver.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_812">The opinion, therefore, that silver is
continually sinking in its value, seems not to be founded upon any good
observations, either upon the prices of corn, or upon those of other
provisions.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_813"><span class="type-margin"><span>The distinction between a rise of prices and a fall in the value of silver is not useless:</span></span>The
 same quantity of silver, it may, perhaps, be said, will in the present
times, even according to the account which has been here given, purchase
 a much smaller quantity of several sorts of provisions than it would
have done during some part of the last century; and to ascertain whether
 this change be owing to a rise in the value of those goods, or to a
fall in the value of silver, is only to establish a vain and useless
distinction, which can be of no sort of service to the man who has only a
 certain quantity of silver to go to market with, or a certain fixed
revenue in money. I certainly do not pretend that the knowledge of this
distinction will enable him to buy cheaper. It may not, however, upon
that account be altogether useless.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_814"><span class="type-margin"><span>it affords an easy proof of the prosperity of the country,</span></span>It
 may be of some use to the public by affording an easy proof of the
prosperous condition of the country. If the rise in the price of some
sorts of provisions be owing altogether to a fall in the value of
silver, it is owing to a circumstance from which nothing can be inferred
 but the fertility of the American mines. The real wealth of the
country, the annual produce of its land and labour, may, notwithstanding
 this circumstance, be either gradually declining, as in Portugal and
Poland; or gradually advancing, as in most other parts of Europe. But if
 this rise in the price of some sorts of provisions be owing to a rise
in the real value of the land which produces them, to its increased
fertility; or, in consequence of more extended improvement and good
cultivation, to its having been rendered fit for producing corn; it is
owing to a circumstance which indicates in the clearest manner the
prosperous and advancing state of the country. The land constitutes by
far the greatest, the most important, and the most durable part of the
wealth of every extensive country. It may surely be of some use, or, at
least, it may give some satisfaction to the Public, to have so decisive a
 proof of the increasing value of by far the greatest, the most
important, and the most durable part of its wealth.</p>

<p id="Smith_0206-01_815">It may too be of some use to the Public in regulating the pecuniary<span class="type-margin"><span>and may be of use in regulating the wages of the inferior servants of the state.</span></span>
 reward of some of its inferior servants. If this rise in the price of
some sorts of provisions be owing to a fall in the value of silver,
their pecuniary reward, provided it was not too large before, ought
certainly to be augmented in proportion to the extent of this fall. If
it is not augmented, their real recompence will evidently be so much
diminished. But if this rise of price is owing to the increased value,
in consequence of the improved fertility of the land which produces such
 provisions, it becomes a much nicer matter to judge either in what
proportion any pecuniary reward ought to be augmented, or whether it
ought to be augmented at all. The extension of improvement and
cultivation, as it necessarily raises more or less, in proportion to the
 price of corn, that of every sort of animal food, so it as necessarily
lowers that of, I believe, every sort of vegetable food. It raises the
price of animal food; because a great part of the land which produces
it, being rendered fit for producing corn, must afford to the landlord
and farmer the rent and profit of corn land. It lowers the price of
vegetable food; because, by increasing the fertility of the land, it
increases its abundance. The improvements of agriculture too introduce
many sorts of vegetable food, which, requiring less land and not more
labour than corn, come much cheaper to market. Such are potatoes and
maize, or what is called Indian corn, the two most important
improvements which the agriculture of Europe, perhaps, which Europe
itself, has received from the great extension of its commerce and
navigation. Many sorts of vegetable food, besides, which in the rude
state of agriculture are confined to the kitchen-garden, and raised only
 by the spade, come in its improved state to be introduced into common
fields, and to be raised by the plough: such as turnips, carrots,
cabbages, &amp;c. If in the progress of improvement, therefore, the real
 price of one species of food necessarily rises, that of another as
necessarily falls, and it becomes a matter of more nicety to judge how
far the rise in the one may be compensated by the fall in the other.
When the real price of butcher’s-meat has once got to its height (which,
 with regard to every sort, except, perhaps, that of hogs flesh, it
seems to have done through a great part of England more than a century
ago), any rise which can afterwards happen in that of any other sort of
animal food, cannot much affect the circumstances of the inferior ranks
of people. The circumstances of the poor through a great part of England
 cannot surely be so much distressed by any rise in the price of
poultry, fish, wild-fowl, or venison, as they must be relieved by the

<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-01_817"><span class="type-margin"><span>But the natural effect of improvement is to diminish the price of manufactures.</span></span>IT
 is the natural effect of improvement, however, to diminish gradually
the real price of almost all manufactures. That of the manufacturing
workmanship diminishes, perhaps, in all of them without exception. In
consequence of better machinery, of greater dexterity, and of a more
proper division and distribution of work, all of which are the natural
effects of improvement, a much smaller quantity of labour becomes
requisite for executing any particular piece of work; and though, in
consequence of the flourishing circumstances of the society, the real
price of labour should rise very considerably, yet the great diminution
of the quantity will generally much more than compensate the greatest
rise which can happen in the price.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt645" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt645_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_818"><span class="type-margin"><span>In a few manufactures the rise in the price of raw material counterbalances improvement in execution,</span></span>There
 are, indeed, a few manufactures, in which the necessary rise in the
real price of the rude materials will more than compensate all the
advantages which improvement can introduce into the execution of the
work. In carpenters and joiners work, and in the coarser sort of cabinet
 work, the necessary rise in the real price of barren timber, in
consequence of the improvement of land, will more than compensate all
the advantages which can be derived from the best machinery, the
greatest dexterity, and the most proper division and distribution of
work.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_819"><span class="type-margin"><span>but in other cases price falls considerably.</span></span>But
 in all cases in which the real price of the rude materials either does
not rise at all, or does not rise very much, that of the manufactured
commodity sinks very considerably.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_820"><span class="type-margin"><span>Since 1600 this has been most remarkable in manufactures made of the coarser metals.</span></span>This
 diminution of price has, in the course of the present and preceding
century, been most remarkable in those manufactures of which the
materials are the coarser metals. A better movement of a watch, than
about the middle of the last century could have been bought for twenty
pounds, may now perhaps be had for twenty shillings. In the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>243<span class="bracket">]</span></span> work of cutlers and locksmiths, in all the toys<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt646" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt646_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 which are made of the coarser metals, and in all those goods which are
commonly known by the name of Birmingham and Sheffield ware, there has
been, during the same period, a very great reduction of price, though
not altogether so great as in watch-work. It has, however, been
sufficient to astonish the workmen of every other part of Europe, who in
 many cases acknowledge that they can produce no work of equal goodness
for double, or even for triple the price. There are perhaps no
manufactures in which the division of labour can be carried further, or
in which the machinery employed admits of a greater variety of
improvements, than those of which the materials are the coarser metals.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_821">In the clothing manufacture there has, during the same period, been<span class="type-margin"><span>Clothing has not fallen much in the same period,</span></span>
 no such sensible reduction of price. The price of superfine cloth, I
have been assured, on the contrary, has, within these five-and-twenty or
 thirty years, risen somewhat in proportion to its quality; owing, it
was said, to a considerable rise in the price of the material, which
consists altogether of Spanish wool. That of the Yorkshire cloth, which
is made altogether of English wool, is said indeed, during the course of
 the present century, to have fallen a good deal in proportion to its
quality. Quality, however, is so very disputable a matter, that I look
upon all information of this kind as somewhat uncertain. In the clothing
 manufacture, the division of labour is nearly the same now as it was a
century ago, and the machinery employed is not very different. There
may, however, have been some small improvements in both, which may have
occasioned some reduction of price.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_822">But<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt647" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt647_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> the reduction will appear much more sensible and undeniable,<span class="type-margin"><span>but very considerably since the fifteenth century.</span></span>
 if we compare the price of this manufacture in the present times with
what it was in a much remoter period, towards the end of the fifteenth
century, when the labour was probably much less subdivided, and the
machinery employed much more imperfect, than it is at present.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_823">In 1487, being the 4th of Henry VII.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt648" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt648_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> it was enacted, that “whosoever<span class="type-margin"><span>Fine cloth has fallen to less than one-third of its price in 1487,</span></span>
 shall sell by retail a broad yard of the finest scarlet grained, or of
other grained cloth of the finest making, above sixteen shillings, shall
 forfeit forty shillings for every yard so sold.” Sixteen shillings,
therefore, containing about the same quantity of silver as
four-and-twenty shillings of our present money, was, at that time,
reckoned not an unreasonable price for a yard of the finest cloth; and
as this is a sumptuary law, such cloth, it is probable, had usually been
 sold <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>244<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 somewhat dearer. A guinea may be reckoned the highest price in the
present times. Even though the quality of the cloths, therefore, should
be supposed equal, and that of the present times is most probably much
superior, yet, even upon this supposition, the money price of the finest
 cloth appears to have been considerably reduced since the end of the
fifteenth century. But its real price has been much more reduced. Six
shillings and eight-pence was then, and long afterwards, reckoned the
average price of a quarter of wheat. Sixteen shillings, therefore, was
the price of two quarters and more than three bushels of wheat. Valuing a
 quarter of wheat in the present times at eight-and-twenty shillings,
the real price of a yard of fine cloth must, in those times, have been
equal to at least three pounds six shillings and sixpence of our present
 money. The man who bought it must have parted with the command of a
quantity of labour and subsistence equal to what that sum would purchase
 in the present times.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_824"><span class="type-margin"><span>and coarse cloth has fallen to less than one half of its price in 1463.</span></span>The reduction in the real price of the coarse manufacture, though considerable, has not been so great as in that of the fine.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_825">In 1463, being the 3d of Edward IV.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt649" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt649_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 it was enacted, that “no servant in husbandry, nor common labourer, nor
 servant to any artificer inhabiting out of a city or burgh, shall use
or wear in their clothing any cloth above two shillings the broad yard.”
 In the 3d of Edward IV. two shillings contained very nearly the same
quantity of silver as four of our present money. But the Yorkshire cloth
 which is now sold at four shillings the yard, is probably much superior
 to any that was then made for the wearing of the very poorest order of
common servants. Even the money price of their clothing, therefore, may,
 in proportion to the quality, be somewhat cheaper in the present than
it was in those ancient times. The real price is certainly a good deal
cheaper. Ten-pence was then reckoned what is called the moderate and
reasonable price of a bushel of wheat. Two shillings, therefore, was the
 price of two bushels and near two pecks of wheat, which in the present
times, at three shillings and sixpence the bushel, would be worth eight
shillings and nine-pence. For a yard of this cloth the poor servant must
 have parted with the power of purchasing a quantity of subsistence
equal to what eight shillings and nine-pence would purchase in the
present times. This is a sumptuary law too, restraining the luxury and
extravagance of the poor. Their clothing, therefore, had commonly been
much more expensive.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>245<span class="bracket">]</span></span>

 wearing hose, of which the price should exceed fourteen-pence the pair,
 equal to about eight-and-twenty pence of our present money. But
fourteen-pence was in those times the price of a bushel and near two
pecks of wheat; which, in the present times, at three and sixpence the
bushel, would cost five shillings and three-pence. We should in the
present times consider this as a very high price for a pair of stockings
 to a servant of the poorest and lowest order. He must, however, in
those times have paid what was really equivalent to this price for them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_827">In the time of Edward IV. the art of knitting stockings was probably<span class="type-margin"><span>when they were made of common cloth.</span></span>
 not known in any part of Europe. Their hose were made of common cloth,
which may have been one of the causes of their dearness. The first
person that wore stockings in England is said to have been Queen
Elizabeth. She received them as a present from the Spanish ambassador.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt650" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt650_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_828">Both in the coarse and in the fine woollen manufacture, the<span class="type-margin"><span>The machinery for making cloth has been much improved,</span></span>
 machinery employed was much more imperfect in those ancient, than it is
 in the present times. It has since received three very capital
improvements, besides, probably, many smaller ones of which it may be
difficult to ascertain either the number or the importance. The three
capital improvements are: first, The exchange of the rock and spindle
for the spinning-wheel, which, with the same quantity of labour, will
perform more than double the quantity of work. Secondly, the use of
several very ingenious machines which facilitate and abridge in a still
greater proportion the winding of the worsted and woollen yarn, or the
proper arrangement of the warp and woof before they are put into the
loom; an operation which, previous to the inventions of those machines,
must have been extremely tedious and troublesome. Thirdly, The
employment of the fulling mill for thickening the cloth, instead of
treading it in water. Neither wind nor water mills of any kind were
known in England so early as the beginning of the sixteenth <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>246<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 century, nor, so far as I know, in any other part of Europe north of
the Alps. They had been introduced into Italy some time before.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_829"><span class="type-margin"><span>which explains the fall of price.</span></span>The
 consideration of these circumstances may, perhaps, in some measure
explain to us why the real price both of the coarse and of the fine
manufacture, was so much higher in those ancient, than it is in the
present times. It cost a greater quantity of labour to bring the goods
to market. When they were brought thither, therefore, they must have
purchased or exchanged for the price of a greater quantity.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_830"><span class="type-margin"><span>The coarse manufacture was a household one,</span></span>The
 coarse manufacture probably was, in those ancient times, carried on in
England, in the same manner as it always has been in countries where
arts and manufactures are in their infancy. It was probably a houshold
manufacture, in which every different part of the work was occasionally
performed by all the different members of almost every private family;
but so as to be their work only when they had nothing else to do, and
not to be the principal business from which any of them derived the
greater part of their subsistence. The work which is performed in this
manner, it has already been observed,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt651" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt651_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> comes always much cheaper to market than that which is the principal or sole fund<span class="type-margin"><span>but the fine was carried on in Flanders by people who subsisted on it, and was subject to customs duty,</span></span>
 of the workman’s subsistence. The fine manufacture, on the other hand,
was not in those times carried on in England, but in the rich and
commercial country of Flanders; and it was probably conducted then, in
the same manner as now, by people who derived the whole, or the
principal part of their subsistence from it. It was besides a foreign
manufacture, and must have paid some duty, the ancient custom of tonnage
 and poundage at least, to the king. This duty, indeed, would not
probably be very great. It was not then the policy of Europe to
restrain, by high duties, the importation of foreign manufactures, but
rather to encourage it, in order that merchants might be enabled to
supply, at as easy a rate as possible, the great men with the
conveniencies and luxuries which they wanted, and which the industry of
their own country could not afford them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_831"><span class="type-margin"><span>which explains why the coarse was in those times lower in proportion to the fine.</span></span>The
 consideration of these circumstances may perhaps in some measure
explain to us why, in those ancient times, the real price of the coarse
manufacture was, in proportion to that of the fine, so much lower than
in the present times.</p>

 improvement in the circumstances of the society tends either directly
or indirectly to raise the real rent of land, to increase the real
wealth of the landlord, his power of purchasing the labour, or the
produce of the labour of other people.</p>

 land, which is first the effect of extended improvement and
cultivation, and afterwards the cause of their being still further
extended, the rise in the price of cattle, for example, tends too to
raise the rent of land directly, and in a still greater proportion. The
real value of the landlord’s share, his real command of the labour of
other people, not only rises with the real value of the produce, but the
 proportion of his share to the whole produce rises with it. That
produce, after the rise in its real price, requires no more labour to
collect it than before. A smaller proportion of it will, therefore, be
sufficient to replace, with the ordinary profit, the stock which employs
 that labour. A greater proportion of it must, consequently, belong to
the landlord.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_835">All those improvements in the productive powers of labour, which<span class="type-margin"><span>Improvements which reduce the price of manufactures raise it indirectly,</span></span>
 tend directly to reduce the real price of manufactures, tend indirectly
 to raise the real rent of land. The landlord exchanges that part of his
 rude produce, which is over and above his own consumption, or what
comes to the same thing, the price of that part of it, for manufactured
produce. Whatever reduces the real price of the latter, raises that of
the former. An equal quantity of the former becomes thereby equivalent
to a greater quantity of the latter; and the landlord is enabled to
purchase a greater quantity of the conveniencies, ornaments, or
luxuries, which he has occasion for.</p>

 the quantity of useful labour employed within it, tends indirectly to
raise the real rent of land. A certain proportion of this labour
naturally goes to the land. A greater number of men and cattle are
employed in its cultivation, the produce increases with the increase of
the stock which is thus employed in raising it, and the rent increases
with the produce.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>248<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_837"><span class="type-margin"><span>The contrary circumstances lower rent.</span></span>The
 contrary circumstances, the neglect of cultivation and improvement, the
 fall in the real price of any part of the rude produce of land, the
rise in the real price of manufactures from the decay of manufacturing
art and industry, the declension of the real wealth of the society, all
tend, on the other hand, to lower the real rent of land, to reduce the
real wealth of the landlord, to diminish his power of purchasing either
the labour, or the produce of the labour of other people.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_838"><span class="type-margin"><span>There are three parts of produce and three original orders of society.</span></span>The
 whole annual produce of the land and labour of every country, or what
comes to the same thing, the whole price of that annual produce,
naturally divides itself, it has already been observed,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt653" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt653_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 into three parts; the rent of land, the wages of labour, and the
profits of stock; and constitutes a revenue to three different orders of
 people; to those who live by rent, to those who live by wages, and to
those who live by profit. These are the three great, original and
constituent orders of every civilized society, from whose revenue that
of every other order is ultimately derived.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_839"><span class="type-margin"><span>The interest of the proprietors of land is inseparably connected with the general interest of the society.</span></span>The
 interest of the first of those three great orders, it appears from what
 has been just now said, is strictly and inseparably connected with the
general interest of the society. Whatever either promotes or obstructs
the one, necessarily promotes or obstructs the other. When the public
deliberates concerning any regulation of commerce or police, the
proprietors of land never can mislead it, with a view to promote the
interest of their own particular order; at least, if they have any
tolerable knowledge of that interest. They are, indeed, too often
defective in this tolerable knowledge. They are the only one of the
three orders whose revenue costs them neither labour nor care, but comes
 to them, as it were, of its own accord, and independent of any plan or
project of their own. That indolence, which is the natural effect of the
 ease and security of their situation, renders them too often, not only
ignorant, but incapable of that application of mind which is necessary
in order to foresee and understand the consequences of any public
regulation.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_840"><span class="type-margin"><span>So also is that of those who live by wages.</span></span>The
 interest of the second order, that of those who live by wages, is as
strictly connected with the interest of the society as that of the
first. The wages of the labourer, it has already been shewn,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt654" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt654_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 are never so high as when the demand for labour is continually rising,
or when the quantity employed is every year increasing considerably.
When this real wealth of the society becomes stationary, his wages are
soon reduced to what is barely enough to enable him to bring up a
family, or to continue the race of labourers. When the society <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>249<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 declines, they fall even below this. The order of proprietors may,
perhaps, gain more by the prosperity of the society, than that of
labourers: but there is no order that suffers so cruelly from its
decline. But though the interest of the labourer is strictly connected
with that of the society, he is incapable either of comprehending that
interest, or of understanding its connexion with his own. His condition
leaves him no time to receive the necessary information, and his
education and habits are commonly such as to render him unfit to judge
even though he was fully informed. In the public deliberations,
therefore, his voice is little heard and less regarded, except upon some
 particular occasions, when his clamour is animated, set on, and
supported by his employers, not for his, but their own particular
purposes.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_841">His employers constitute the third order, that of those who live by<span class="type-margin"><span>but the interest of those who live by profit has not the same connexion with the general interest of the society.</span></span>
 profit. It is the stock that is employed for the sake of profit, which
puts into motion the greater part of the useful labour of every society.
 The plans and projects of the employers of stock regulate and direct
all the most important operations of labour, and profit is the end
proposed by all those plans and projects. But the rate of profit does
not, like rent and wages, rise with the prosperity, and fall with the
declension, of the society. On the contrary, it is naturally low in
rich, and high in poor countries, and it is always highest in the
countries which are going fastest to ruin. The interest of this third
order, therefore, has not the same connexion with the general interest
of the society as that of the other two. Merchants and master
manufacturers are, in this order, the two classes of people who commonly
 employ the largest capitals, and who by their wealth draw to themselves
 the greatest share of the public consideration. As during their whole
lives they are engaged in plans and projects, they have frequently more
acuteness of understanding than the greater part of country gentlemen.
As their thoughts, however, are commonly exercised rather about the
interest of their own particular branch of business, than about that of
the society, their judgment, even when given with the greatest candour
(which it has not been upon every occasion), is much more to be depended
 upon with regard to the former of those two objects, than with regard
to the latter. Their superiority over the country gentleman is, not so
much in their knowledge of the public interest, as in their having a
better knowledge of their own interest than he has of his. It is by this
 superior knowledge of their own interest that they have frequently
imposed upon his generosity, and persuaded him to give up both his own
interest and that of the public, from a very simple but honest
conviction, that their interest, and not his, was the interest of the
public, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>250<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 The interest of the dealers, however, in any particular branch of trade
 or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even
opposite to, that of the public. To widen the market and to narrow the
competition, is always the interest of the dealers. To widen the market
may frequently be agreeable enough to the interest of the public; but to
 narrow the competition must always be against it, and can serve only to
 enable the dealers, by raising their profits above what they naturally
would be, to levy, for their own benefit, an absurd tax upon the rest of
 their fellow-citizens. The proposal of any new law or regulation of
commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to
with great precaution, and ought never to be adopted till after having
been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but
 with the most suspicious attention. It comes from an order of men,
whose interest is never exactly the same with that of the public, who
have generally an interest to deceive and even to oppress the public,
and who accordingly have, upon many occasions, both deceived and
oppressed it.</p>

<h2 id="lf0206-01_label_725">BOOK II: Of the Nature, Accumulation, and Employment of Stock</h2>
<div id="lf0206-01_div_037" class="type-introduction">
<h2 id="lf0206-01_head_038">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-01_843"><span class="type-margin"><span>In the rude state of society stock is unnecessary.</span></span>IN
 that rude state of society in which there is no division of labour, in
which exchanges are seldom made, and in which every man provides every
thing for himself, it is not necessary that any stock should be
accumulated or stored up beforehand, in order to carry on the business
of the society. Every man endeavours to supply by his own industry his
own occasional wants as they occur. When he is hungry, he goes to the
forest to hunt; when his coat is worn out, he clothes himself with the
skin of the first large animal he kills: and when his hut begins to go
to ruin, he repairs it, as well as he can, with the trees and the turf
that are nearest it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_844"><span class="type-margin"><span>Division of labour makes it necessary.</span></span>But
 when the division of labour has once been thoroughly introduced, the
produce of a man’s own labour can supply but a very small part of his
occasional wants. The far greater part of them are supplied by the
produce of other mens labour, which he purchases with the produce, or,
what is the same thing, with the price of the produce of his own. But
this purchase cannot be made till such time as the produce of his own
labour has not only been completed, but sold. A stock of goods of
different kinds, therefore, must be stored up somewhere sufficient to
maintain him, and to supply him with the materials and tools of his
work, till such time, at least, as both these events can be brought
about. A weaver cannot apply himself entirely to his peculiar business,
unless there is beforehand stored up somewhere, either in his own
possession or in that of some other person, a stock sufficient to
maintain him, and to supply him with the materials and tools of his
work, till he has not only completed but sold his web. <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>259<span class="bracket">]</span></span> This accumulation must, evidently, be previous to his applying his industry for so long a time to such a peculiar business.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt669" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt669_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_845">As the accumulation of stock must, in the nature of things, be<span class="type-margin"><span>Accumulation of stock and division of labour advance together.</span></span> previous to the division of labour, so labour can be more and more subdivided<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt670" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt670_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 in proportion only as stock is previously more and more accumulated.
The quantity of materials which the same number of people can work up,
increases in a great proportion as labour comes to be more and more
subdivided; and as the operations of each workman are gradually reduced
to a greater degree of simplicity, a variety of new machines come to be
invented for facilitating and abridging those operations. As the
division of labour advances, therefore, in order to give constant
employment to an equal number of workmen, an equal stock of provisions,
and a greater stock of materials and tools than what would have been
necessary in a ruder state of things, must be accumulated beforehand.
But the number of workmen in every branch of business generally
increases with the division of labour in that branch, or rather it is
the increase of their number which enables them to class and subdivide
themselves in this manner.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_846">As the accumulation of stock is previously necessary for carrying on<span class="type-margin"><span>Accumulation causes the same quantity of industry to produce more.</span></span>
 this great improvement in the productive powers of labour, so that
accumulation naturally leads to this improvement. The person who employs
 his stock in maintaining labour, necessarily wishes to employ it in
such a manner as to produce as great a quantity of work as possible. He
endeavours, therefore, both to make among his workmen the most proper
distribution of employment, and to furnish them with the best machines
which he can either invent or afford to purchase. His abilities in both
these respects are generally in proportion to the extent of his stock,
or to the number of people whom it can employ. The quantity of industry,
 therefore, not only increases in every country with the increase of the
 stock which employs it, but, in consequence of that increase, the same
quantity of industry produces a much greater quantity of work.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_847">Such are in general the effects of the increase of stock upon industry and its productive powers.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_848">In the following book I have endeavoured to explain the nature of<span class="type-margin"><span>This Book treats of the nature of stock, the effects of its accumulation, and its different employments.</span></span>
 stock, the effects of its accumulation into capitals of different
kinds, and the effects of the different employments of those capitals.
This book is divided into five chapters. In the first chapter, I have
endeavoured to show what are the different parts or branches into which <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>260<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 the stock, either of an individual, or of a great society, naturally
divides itself. In the second, I have endeavoured to explain the nature
and operation of money considered as a particular branch of the general
stock of the society. The stock which is accumulated into a capital, may
 either be employed by the person to whom it belongs, or it may be lent
to some other person. In the third and fourth chapters, I have
endeavoured to examine the manner in which it operates in both these
situations. The fifth and last chapter treats of the different effects
which the different employments of capital immediately produce upon the
quantity both of national industry, and of the annual produce of land
and labour.</p>

<div id="lf0206-01_div_038" class="type-chapter">
<h2 id="lf0206-01_label_728">CHAPTER I: OF THE DIVISION OF STOCK</h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-01_849">WHEN the stock which a man possesses is no more than sufficient<span class="type-margin"><span>A man does not think of obtaining revenue from a small stock,</span></span>
 to maintain him for a few days or a few weeks, he seldom thinks of
deriving any revenue from it. He consumes it as sparingly as he can, and
 endeavours by his labour to acquire something which may supply its
place before it be consumed altogether. His revenue is, in this case,
derived from his labour only. This is the state of the greater part of
the labouring poor in all countries.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_850">But when he possesses stock sufficient to maintain him for months<span class="type-margin"><span>but when he has more than enough for immediate consumption, he endeavours to derive a revenue from the rest,</span></span>
 or years, he naturally endeavours to derive a revenue from the greater
part of it; reserving only so much for his immediate consumption as may
maintain him till this revenue begins to come in. His whole stock,
therefore, is distinguished into two parts. That part which, he expects,
 is to afford him this revenue, is called his capital. The other is that
 which supplies his immediate consumption; and which consists either,
first, in that portion of his whole stock which was originally reserved
for this purpose; or, secondly, in his revenue, from whatever source
derived, as it gradually comes in; or, thirdly, in such things as had
been purchased by either of these in former years, and which are not yet
 entirely consumed; such as a stock of clothes, household furniture, and
 the like. In one, or other, or all of these three articles, consists
the stock which men commonly reserve for their own immediate
consumption.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_851">There are two different ways in which a capital may be employed so<span class="type-margin"><span>using it either as</span></span> as to yield a revenue or profit to its employer.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_852">First, it may be employed in raising, manufacturing, or purchasing<span class="type-margin"><span>(1) circulating capital,</span></span>
 goods, and selling them again with a profit. The capital employed in
this manner yields no revenue or profit to its employer, while it either
 remains in his possession, or continues in the same shape. The goods of
 the merchant yield him no revenue or profit till he sells them for <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>262<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 money, and the money yields him as little till it is again exchanged
for goods. His capital is continually going from him in one shape, and
returning to him in another, and it is only by means of such
circulation, or successive exchanges, that it can yield him any profit.
Such capitals, therefore, may very properly be called circulating
capitals.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_853"><span class="type-margin"><span>or (2) fixed capital.</span></span>Secondly,
 it may be employed in the improvement of land, in the purchase of
useful machines and instruments of trade, or in such-like things as
yield a revenue or profit without changing masters, or circulating any
further. Such capitals, therefore, may very properly be called fixed
capitals.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_854"><span class="type-margin"><span>Different proportions of fixed and circulating capital are required in different trades.</span></span>Different occupations require very different proportions between the fixed and circulating capitals employed in them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_855">The capital of a merchant, for example, is
altogether a circulating capital. He has occasion for no machines or
instruments of trade, unless his shop, or warehouse, be considered as
such.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_856">Some part of the capital of every master
artificer or manufacturer must be fixed in the instruments of his trade.
 This part, however, is very small in some, and very great in others. A
master taylor requires no other instruments of trade but a parcel of
needles. Those of the master shoemaker are a little, though but a very
little, more expensive. Those of the weaver rise a good deal above those
 of the shoemaker. The far greater part of the capital of all such
master artificers, however, is circulated, either in the wages of their
workmen, or in the price of their materials, and repaid with a profit by
 the price of the work.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_857">In other works a much greater fixed capital is
 required. In a great iron-work, for example, the furnace for melting
the ore, the forge, the slitt-mill, are instruments of trade which
cannot be erected without a very great expence. In coal-works, and mines
 of every kind, the machinery necessary both for drawing out the water
and for other purposes, is frequently still more expensive.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_858">That part of the capital of the farmer which
is employed in the instruments of agriculture is a fixed; that which is
employed in the wages and maintenance of his labouring servants, is a
circulating capital. He makes a profit of the one by keeping it in his
own possession, and of the other by parting with it. The price or value
of his labouring cattle is a fixed capital in the same manner as that of
 the instruments of husbandry: Their maintenance is a circulating
capital in the same manner as that of the labouring servants. The farmer
 makes his profit by keeping the labouring cattle, and by parting with
their maintenance. Both the price and the maintenance of the cattle
which are bought in and fattened, not for labour, but for sale, are a <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>263<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 circulating capital. The farmer makes his profit by parting with them. A
 flock of sheep or a herd of cattle that, in a breeding country, is
bought in, neither for labour, nor for sale, but in order to make a
profit by their wool, by their milk, and by their increase, is a fixed
capital. The profit is made by keeping them. Their maintenance is a
circulating capital. The profit is made by parting with it; and it comes
 back with both its own profit, and the profit upon the whole price of
the cattle, in the price of the wool, the milk, and the increase. The
whole value of the seed too is properly a fixed capital. Though it goes
backwards and forwards between the ground and the granary, it never
changes masters, and therefore does not properly circulate. The farmer
makes his profit, not by its sale, but by its increase.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_859">The general stock of any country or society is the same with that of<span class="type-margin"><span>The stock of a society is divided in the same way into</span></span>
 all its inhabitants or members, and therefore naturally divides itself
into the same three portions, each of which has a distinct function or
office.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_860">The First, is that portion which is reserved for immediate consumption,<span class="type-margin"><span>(1) the portion reserved for immediate consumption,</span></span>
 and of which the characteristic is, that it affords no revenue or
profit. It consists in the stock of food, clothes, household furniture,
&amp;c., which have been purchased by their proper consumers, but which
are not yet entirely consumed. The whole stock of mere dwelling-houses
too subsisting at any one time in the country, make a part of this first
 portion. The stock that is laid out in a house, if it is to be the
dwelling-house of the proprietor, ceases from that moment to serve in
the function of a capital, or to afford any revenue to its owner. A
dwelling-house, as such, contributes nothing to the revenue of its
inhabitant; and though it is, no doubt, extremely useful to him, it is
as his clothes and household furniture are useful to him, which,
however, make a part of his expence, and not of his revenue. If it is to
 be let to a tenant for rent, as the house itself can produce nothing,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt671" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt671_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 the tenant must always pay the rent out of some other revenue which he
derives either from labour, or stock, or land. Though a house,
therefore, may yield a revenue to its proprietor, and thereby serve in
the function of a capital to him, it cannot yield any to the public, nor
 serve in the function of a capital to it, and the revenue of the whole
body of the people can never be in the smallest degree increased by it.
Clothes, and household furniture, in the same manner, sometimes yield <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>264<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 a revenue, and thereby serve in the function of a capital to particular
 persons. In countries where masquerades are common, it is a trade to
let out masquerade dresses for a night. Upholsterers frequently let
furniture by the month or by the year. Undertakers let the furniture of
funerals by the day and by the week. Many people let furnished houses,
and get a rent, not only for the use of the house, but for that of the
furniture. The revenue, however, which is derived from such things, must
 always be ultimately drawn from some other source of revenue. Of all
parts of the stock, either of an individual, or of a society, reserved
for immediate consumption, what is laid out in houses is most slowly
consumed. A stock of clothes may last several years: a stock of
furniture half a century or a century: but a stock of houses, well built
 and properly taken care of, may last many centuries. Though the period
of their total consumption, however, is more distant, they are still as
really a stock reserved for immediate consumption as either clothes or
household furniture.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_861"><span class="type-margin"><span>(2) the fixed capital, which consists of</span></span>The
 Second of the three portions into which the general stock of the
society divides itself, is the fixed capital; of which the
characteristic is, that it affords a revenue or profit without
circulating or changing masters. It consists chiefly of the four
following articles:</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_862"><span class="type-margin"><span>(<span class="ital">a</span>) useful machines,</span></span>First, of all useful machines and instruments of trade which facilitate and abridge labour:</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_863"><span class="type-margin"><span>(<span class="ital">b</span>) profitable buildings,</span></span>Secondly,
 of all those profitable buildings which are the means of procuring a
revenue, not only to their proprietor who lets them for a rent, but to
the person who possesses them and pays that rent for them; such as
shops, warehouses, workhouses, farmhouses, with all their necessary
buildings; stables, granaries, &amp;c. These are very different from
mere dwelling houses. They are a sort of instruments of trade, and may
be considered in the same light:</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_864"><span class="type-margin"><span>(<span class="ital">c</span>) improvements of land,</span></span>Thirdly,
 of the improvements of land, of what has been profitably laid out in
clearing, draining, enclosing, manuring, and reducing it into the
condition most proper for tillage and culture. An improved farm may very
 justly be regarded in the same light as those useful machines which
facilitate and abridge labour, and by means of which, an equal
circulating capital can afford a much greater revenue to its employer.
An improved farm is equally advantageous and more durable than any of
those machines, frequently requiring no other repairs than the most
profitable application of the farmer’s capital employed in cultivating
it:</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_865"><span class="type-margin"><span>and (<span class="ital">d</span>) acquired and useful abilities,</span></span>Fourthly,
 of the acquired and useful abilities of all the inhabitants or members
of the society. The acquisition of such talents, by the maintenance of
the acquirer during his education, study, or apprenticeship, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>265<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 always costs a real expence, which is a capital fixed and realized, as
it were, in his person. Those talents, as they make a part of his
fortune, so do they likewise of that of the society to which he belongs.
 The improved dexterity of a workman may be considered in the same light
 as a machine or instrument of trade which facilitates and abridges
labour, and which, though it costs a certain expence, repays that
expence with a profit.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt672" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt672_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_866">The Third and last of the three portions into which the general stock<span class="type-margin"><span>and (3) the circulating capital, which consists of</span></span>
 of the society naturally divides itself, is the circulating capital; of
 which the characteristic is, that it affords a revenue only by
circulating or changing masters. It is composed likewise of four parts:</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_867">First, of the money by means of which all the other three are<span class="type-margin"><span>(<span class="ital">a</span>) the money,</span></span> circulated and distributed to their proper consumers:<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt673" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt673_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_868">Secondly, of the stock of provisions which are in the possession of<span class="type-margin"><span>(<span class="ital">b</span>) the stock of provisions in the possession of the sellers,</span></span>
 the butcher, the grazier, the farmer, the corn-merchant, the brewer,
&amp;c. and from the sale of which they expect to derive a profit:</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_869">Thirdly, of the materials, whether altogether rude, or more or less<span class="type-margin"><span>(<span class="ital">c</span>) the materials of clothes, furniture and buildings,</span></span>
 manufactured, of clothes, furniture and building, which are not yet
made up into any of those three shapes, but which remain in the hands of
 the growers, the manufacturers, the mercers, and drapers, the
timber-merchants, the carpenters and joiners, the brick-makers, &amp;c.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_870">Fourthly, and lastly, of the work which is made up and completed,<span class="type-margin"><span>and (<span class="ital">d</span>) completed work in the hands of the merchant or manufacturer.</span></span>
 but which is still in the hands of the merchant or manufacturer, and
not yet disposed of or distributed to the proper consumers; such as the
finished work which we frequently find ready-made in the shops of the
smith, the cabinet-maker, the goldsmith, the jeweller, the
china-merchant, &amp;c. The circulating capital consists in this manner,
 of the provisions, materials, and finished work of all kinds that are
in the hands of their respective dealers, and of the money that is
necessary for circulating and distributing them to those who are finally
 to use, or to consume them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_871">Of these four parts three, provisions, materials, and finished work,<span class="type-margin"><span>The last three parts of the circulating capital are regularly withdrawn from it.</span></span>
 are, either annually, or in a longer or shorter period, regularly
withdrawn from it, and placed either in the fixed capital or in the
stock reserved for immediate consumption.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_872">Every fixed capital is both originally derived
 from, and requires to be continually supported by a circulating
capital. All useful machines and instruments of trade are originally
derived from a circulating capital,<span class="type-margin"><span>Every fixed capital is derived from and supported by a circulating capital,</span></span> which furnishes the materials of which they are made, and the maintenance <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>266<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of the workmen who make them. They require too a capital of the same kind to keep them in constant repair.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_873"><span class="type-margin"><span>and cannot yield any revenue without it.</span></span>No
 fixed capital can yield any revenue but by means of a circulating
capital. The most useful machines and instruments of trade will produce
nothing without the circulating capital which affords the materials they
 are employed upon, and the maintenance of the workmen who employ them.
Land, however improved, will yield no revenue without a circulating
capital, which maintains the labourers who cultivate and collect its
produce.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_874"><span class="type-margin"><span>The end of both fixed and circulating capital is to maintain and augment the other part of the stock.</span></span>To
 maintain and augment the stock which may be reserved for immediate
consumption, is the sole end and purpose both of the fixed and
circulating capitals. It is this stock which feeds, clothes, and lodges
the people. Their riches or poverty depends upon the abundant or sparing
 supplies which those two capitals can afford to the stock reserved for
immediate consumption.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_875"><span class="type-margin"><span>The circulating capital is kept up by the produce of land, mines, and fisheries,</span></span>So
 great a part of the circulating capital being continually withdrawn
from it, in order to be placed in the other two branches of the general
stock of the society; it must in its turn require continual supplies,
without which it would soon cease to exist. These supplies are
principally drawn from three sources, the produce of land, of mines, and
 of fisheries. These afford continual supplies of provisions and
materials, of which part is afterwards wrought up into finished work,
and by which are replaced the provisions, materials, and finished work
continually withdrawn from the circulating capital. From mines too is
drawn what is necessary for maintaining and augmenting that part of it
which consists in money. For though, in the ordinary course of business,
 this part is not, like the other three, necessarily withdrawn from it,
in order to be placed in the other two branches of the general stock of
the society, it must, however, like all other things, be wasted and worn
 out at last, and sometimes too be either lost or sent abroad, and must,
 therefore, require continual, though, no doubt, much smaller supplies.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_876"><span class="type-margin"><span>which require both fixed and circulating capitals to cultivate them,</span></span>Land,
 mines, and fisheries, require all both a fixed and a circulating
capital to cultivate them: and their produce replaces with a profit, not
 only those capitals, but all the others in the society. Thus the farmer
 annually replaces to the manufacturer the provisions which he had
consumed and the materials which he had wrought up the year before; and
the manufacturer replaces to the farmer the finished work which he had
wasted and worn out in the same time. This is the real exchange that is
annually made between those two orders of people, though it seldom
happens that the rude produce of the one and the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>267<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 manufactured produce of the other, are directly bartered for one
another; because it seldom happens that the farmer sells his corn and
his cattle, his flax and his wool, to the very same person of whom he
chuses to purchase the clothes, furniture, and instruments of trade
which he wants. He sells, therefore, his rude produce for money, with
which he can purchase, wherever it is to be had, the manufactured
produce he has occasion for. Land even replaces, in part at least, the
capitals with which fisheries and mines are cultivated. It is the
produce of land which draws the fish from the waters; and it is the
produce of the surface of the earth which extracts the minerals from its
 bowels.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_877">The produce of land, mines, and fisheries, when their natural fertility<span class="type-margin"><span>and, when their fertility is equal, yield produce proportionate to the capital employed</span></span>
 is equal, is in proportion to the extent and proper application of the
capitals employed about them. When the capitals are equal and equally
well applied, it is in proportion to their natural fertility.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_878">In all countries where there is tolerable security, every man of<span class="type-margin"><span>Where there is tolerable security all stock is employed in one or other of the three ways.</span></span>
 common understanding will endeavour to employ whatever stock he can
command, in procuring either present enjoyment or future profit. If it
is employed in procuring present enjoyment, it is a stock reserved for
immediate consumption. If it is employed in procuring future profit, it
must procure this profit either by staying with him, or by going from
him. In the one case it is a fixed, in the other it is a circulating
capital. A man must be perfectly crazy who, where there is tolerable
security, does not employ all the stock which he commands, whether it be
 his own or borrowed of other people, in some one or other of those
three ways.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_879">In those unfortunate countries, indeed, where men are continually<span class="type-margin"><span>But in countries where violence prevails much stock is buried and concealed.</span></span>
 afraid of the violence of their superiors, they frequently bury and
conceal a great part of their stock, in order to have it always at hand
to carry with them to some place of safety, in case of their being
threatened with any of those disasters to which they consider themselves
 as at all times exposed. This is said to be a common practice in
Turkey, in Indostan, and, I believe, in most other governments of Asia.
It seems to have been a common practice among our ancestors during the
violence of the feudal government. Treasure-trove was in those times
considered as no contemptible part of the revenue of the greatest
sovereigns in Europe. It consisted in such treasure as was found
concealed in the earth, and to which no particular person could prove
any right. This was regarded in those times as so important an object,
that it was always considered as belonging to the sovereign, and neither
 to the finder nor to the proprietor of the land, unless the right to it
 had <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>268<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 been conveyed to the latter by an express clause in his charter. It was
 put upon the same footing with gold and silver mines, which, without a
special clause in the charter, were never supposed to be comprehended in
 the general grant of the lands, though mines of lead, copper, tin, and
coal were, as things of smaller consequence.</p>

<h2 id="lf0206-01_label_732">CHAPTER II: OF MONEY CONSIDERED AS A
PARTICULAR BRANCH OF THE GENERAL STOCK OF THE SOCIETY, OR OF THE EXPENCE
 OF MAINTAINING THE NATIONAL CAPITAL</h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-01_880">IT has been shewn in the first Book, that the price of the greater<span class="type-margin"><span>Prices are divided into three parts, wages, profits, and rent,</span></span>
 part of commodities resolves itself into three parts, of which one pays
 the wages of the labour, another the profits of the stock, and a third
the rent of the land which had been employed in producing and bringing
them to market: that there are, indeed, some commodities of which the
price is made up of two of those parts only, the wages of labour, and
the profits of stock: and a very few in which it consists altogether in
one, the wages of labour: but that the price of every commodity
necessarily resolves itself into some one, or other, or all of these
three parts; every part of it which goes neither to rent nor to wages,
being necessarily profit to somebody.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_881">Since this is the case, it has been observed, with regard to every<span class="type-margin"><span>and the whole annual produce is divided into the same three parts;</span></span>
 particular commodity, taken separately; it must be so with regard to
all the commodities which compose the whole annual produce of the land
and labour of every country, taken complexly. The whole price or
exchangeable value of that annual produce, must resolve itself into the
same three parts, and be parcelled out among the different inhabitants
of the country, either as the wages of their labour, the profits of
their stock, or the rent of their land.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_882">But though the whole value of the annual produce of the land and<span class="type-margin"><span>but we may distinguish between gross and net revenue.</span></span>
 labour of every country is thus divided among and constitutes a revenue
 to its different inhabitants; yet as in the rent of a private estate we
 distinguish between the gross rent and the neat rent, so may we
likewise in the revenue of all the inhabitants of a great country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_883">The gross rent of a private estate comprehends whatever is paid by<span class="type-margin"><span>Gross rent is the whole sum paid by the farmer; net rent what is left free to the landlord.</span></span>
 the farmer; the neat rent, what remains free to the landlord, after
deducting the expence of management, of repairs, and all other necessary
 charges; or what, without hurting his estate, he can afford to place in
 <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>270<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 his stock reserved for immediate consumption, or to spend upon his
table, equipage, the ornaments of his house and furniture, his private
enjoyments and amusements. His real wealth is in proportion, not to his
gross, but to his neat rent.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_884"><span class="type-margin"><span>Gross revenue
is the whole annual produce: net revenue what is left free after
deducting the maintenance of fixed and circulating capital.</span></span>The
 gross revenue of all the inhabitants of a great country, comprehends
the whole annual produce of their land and labour; the neat revenue,
what remains free to them after deducting the expence of maintaining;
first, their fixed; and, secondly, their circulating capital; or what,
without encroaching upon their capital, they can place in their stock
reserved for immediate consumption, or spend upon their subsistence,
conveniencies, and amusements. Their real wealth too is in proportion,
not to their gross, but to their neat revenue.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_885">The whole expence of maintaining the fixed
capital, must evidently be excluded from the neat revenue of the
society. Neither the materials necessary for supporting their useful
machines and instruments of trade,<span class="type-margin"><span>The whole expence of maintaining the fixed capital must be excluded,</span></span>
 their profitable buildings, &amp;c. nor the produce of the labour
necessary for fashioning those materials into the proper form, can ever
make any part of it. The price of that labour may indeed make a part of
it; as the workmen so employed may place the whole value of their wages
in their stock reserved for immediate consumption. But in other sorts of
 labour, both the price and the produce go to this stock, the price to
that of the workmen, the produce to that of other people, whose
subsistence, conveniencies, and amusements, are augmented by the labour
of those workmen.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_886"><span class="type-margin"><span>since the only object of the fixed capital is to increase the productive powers of labour,</span></span>The
 intention of the fixed capital is to increase the productive powers of
labour, or to enable the same number of labourers to perform a much
greater quantity of work. In a farm where all the necessary buildings,
fences, drains, communications, &amp;c. are in the most perfect good
order, the same number of labourers and labouring cattle will raise a
much greater produce, than in one of equal extent and equally good
ground, but not furnished with equal conveniencies. In manufactures the
same number of hands, assisted with the best machinery, will work up a
much greater quantity of goods than with more imperfect instruments of
trade. The expence which is properly laid out upon a fixed capital of
any kind, is always repaid with great profit, and increases the annual
produce by a much greater value than that of the support which such
improvements require. This support, however, still requires a certain
portion of that produce. A certain quantity of materials, and the labour
 of a certain number of workmen, both of which might have been
immediately employed to augment the food, clothing and lodging, the
subsistence and conveniencies of the society, are thus diverted to <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>271<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 another employment, highly advantageous indeed, but still different
from this one. It is upon this account that all such improvements in<span class="type-margin"><span>and any cheapening or simplification is regarded as a good.</span></span>
 mechanics, as enable the same number of workmen to perform an equal
quantity of work with cheaper and simpler machinery than had been usual
before, are always regarded as advantageous to every society. A certain
quantity of materials, and the labour of a certain number of workmen,
which had before been employed in supporting a more complex and
expensive machinery, can afterwards be applied to augment the quantity
of work which that or any other machinery is useful only for performing.
 The undertaker of some great manufactory who employs a thousand a-year
in the maintenance of his machinery, if he can reduce this expence to
five hundred, will naturally<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt674" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt674_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 employ the other five hundred in purchasing an additional quantity of
materials to be wrought up by an additional number of workmen. The
quantity of that work, therefore, which his machinery was useful only
for performing, will naturally be augmented, and with it all the
advantage and conveniency which the society can derive from that work.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_887">The expence of maintaining the fixed capital in a great country,<span class="type-margin"><span>The cost of maintaining the fixed capital is like the cost of repairs on an estate,</span></span>
 may very properly be compared to that of repairs in a private estate.
The expence of repairs may frequently be necessary for supporting the
produce of the estate, and consequently both the gross and the neat rent
 of the landlord. When by a more proper direction, however, it can be
diminished without occasioning any diminution of produce, the gross rent
 remains at least the same as before, and the neat rent is necessarily
augmented.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_888">But though the whole expence of maintaining the fixed capital is<span class="type-margin"><span>but the expence of maintaining the last three parts of the circulating capital is not to be deducted,</span></span>
 thus necessarily excluded from the neat revenue of the society, it is
not the same case with that of maintaining the circulating capital. Of
the four parts of which this latter capital is composed, money,
provisions, materials, and finished work, the three last, it has already
 been observed, are regularly withdrawn from it, and placed either in
the fixed capital of the society, or in their stock reserved for
immediate consumption. Whatever portion of those consumable goods is not
 employed in maintaining the former, goes all to the latter, and makes a
 part of the neat revenue of the society. The maintenance of those three
 parts of the circulating capital, therefore, withdraws no portion of
the annual produce from the neat revenue of the society, besides what is
 necessary for maintaining the fixed capital.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>272<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_889"><span class="type-margin"><span>the circulating capital of the society being different in this respect from that of an individual</span></span>The
 circulating capital of a society is in this respect different from that
 of an individual. That of an individual is totally excluded from making
 any part of his neat revenue, which must consist altogether in his
profits. But though the circulating capital of every individual makes a
part of that of the society to which he belongs, it is not upon that
account totally excluded from making a part likewise of their neat
revenue. Though the whole goods in a merchant’s shop must by no means be
 placed in his own stock reserved for immediate consumption, they may in
 that of other people, who, from a revenue derived from other funds, may
 regularly replace their value to him, together with its profits,
without occasioning any diminution either of his capital or of theirs.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt675" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt675_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_890"><span class="type-margin"><span>The maintenance of the money alone must be deducted.</span></span>Money,
 therefore, is the only part of the circulating capital of a society, of
 which the maintenance can occasion any diminution in their neat
revenue.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_891"><span class="type-margin"><span>The money resembles the fixed capital, since</span></span>The
 fixed capital, and that part of the circulating capital which consists
in money, so far as they affect the revenue of the society, bear a very
great resemblance to one another.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_892"><span class="type-margin"><span>(1) the maintenance of the stock of money is part of the gross but not of the net revenue,</span></span>First,
 as those machines and instruments of trade, &amp;c. require a certain
expence, first to erect them, and afterwards to support them, both which
 expences, though they make a part of the gross, are deductions from the
 neat revenue of the society; so the stock of money which circulates in
any country must require a certain expence, first to collect it, and
afterwards to support it, both which expences, though they make a part
of the gross, are, in the same manner, deductions from the neat revenue
of the society. A certain quantity of very valuable materials, gold and
silver, and of very curious labour, instead of augmenting the stock
reserved for immediate consumption, the subsistence, conveniencies, and
amusements of individuals, is employed in supporting that great but
expensive instrument of commerce, by means of which every individual in
the society has his subsistence, conveniencies, and amusements,
regularly distributed to him in their proper proportion.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_893"><span class="type-margin"><span>and (2) the money itself forms no part of the net revenue.</span></span>Secondly,
 as the machines and instruments of trade, &amp;c. which compose the
fixed capital either of an individual or of a society, make no part
either of the gross or of the neat revenue of either; so money, by means
 of which the whole revenue of the society is regularly distributed
among all its different members, makes itself no part of that revenue.
The great wheel of circulation is altogether different from <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>273<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 the goods which are circulated by means of it. The revenue of the
society consists altogether in those goods, and not in the wheel which
circulates them. In computing either the gross or the neat revenue of
any society, we must always, from their whole annual circulation of
money and goods, deduct the whole value of the money, of which not a
single farthing can ever make any part of either.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt676" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt676_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_894">It is the ambiguity of language only which can make this proposition<span class="type-margin"><span>It
 only appears to do so from the ambiguity of language, sums of money
being often used to indicate the goods purchaseable as well as the coins
 themselves.</span></span> appear either doubtful or paradoxical. When properly explained and understood, it is almost self-evident.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_895">When we talk of any particular sum of money,
we sometimes mean nothing but the metal pieces of which it is composed;
and sometimes we include in our meaning some obscure reference to the
goods which can be had in exchange for it, or to the power of purchasing
 which the possession of it conveys. Thus when we say, that the
circulating money of England has been computed at eighteen millions, we
mean only to express the amount of the metal pieces, which some writers
have computed, or rather have supposed to circulate in that country. But
 when we say that a man is worth fifty or a hundred pounds a-year, we
mean commonly to express not only the amount of the metal pieces which
are annually paid to him, but the value of the goods which he can
annually purchase or consume. We mean commonly to ascertain what is or
ought to be his way of living, or the quantity and quality of the
necessaries and conveniencies of life in which he can with propriety
indulge himself.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_896">When, by any particular sum of money, we mean not only to express<span class="type-margin"><span>We must not add both together.</span></span>
 the amount of the metal pieces of which it is composed, but to include
in its signification some obscure reference to the goods which can be
had in exchange for them, the wealth or revenue which it in this case
denotes, is equal only to one of the two values which are thus intimated
 somewhat ambiguously by the same word, and to the latter more properly
than to the former, to the money’s worth more properly than to the
money.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_897">Thus if a guinea be the weekly pension of a particular person, he<span class="type-margin"><span>If a man has a guinea a week he enjoys a guinea’s worth of subsistence, &amp;c.,</span></span>
 can in the course of the week purchase with it a certain quantity of
subsistence, conveniencies, and amusements. In proportion as this
quantity is great or small, so are his real riches, his real weekly
revenue. His weekly revenue is certainly not equal both to the guinea,
and to what can be purchased with it, but only to one or <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>274<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 other of those two equal values; and to the latter more properly than
to the former, to the guinea’s worth rather than to the guinea.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_898"><span class="type-margin"><span>and his real revenue is that subsistence, &amp;c.</span></span>If
 the pension of such a person was paid to him, not in gold, but in a
weekly bill for a guinea, his revenue surely would not so properly
consist in the piece of paper, as in what he could get for it. A guinea
may be considered as a bill for a certain quantity of necessaries and
conveniencies upon all the tradesmen in the neighbourhood. The revenue
of the person to whom it is paid, does not so properly consist in the
piece of gold, as in what he can get for it, or in what he can exchange
it for. If it could be exchanged for nothing, it would, like a bill upon
 a bankrupt, be of no more value than the most useless piece of paper.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_899"><span class="type-margin"><span>The same is true of all the inhabitants of a country.</span></span>Though
 the weekly or yearly revenue of all the different inhabitants of any
country, in the same manner, may be, and in reality frequently is paid
to them in money, their real riches, however, the real weekly or yearly
revenue of all of them taken together, must always be great or small in
proportion to the quantity of consumable goods which they can all of
them purchase with this money. The whole revenue of all of them taken
together is evidently not equal to both the money and the consumable
goods; but only to one or other of those two values, and to the latter
more properly than to the former.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_900">Though we frequently, therefore, express a
person’s revenue by the metal pieces which are annually paid to him, it
is because the amount of those pieces regulates the extent of his power
of purchasing, or the value of the goods which he can annually afford to
 consume. We still consider his revenue as consisting in this power of
purchasing or consuming, and not in the pieces which convey it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_901"><span class="type-margin"><span>The coins
annually paid to an individual often equal his revenue, but the stock of
 coin in a society is never equal to its whole revenue.</span></span>But
 if this is sufficiently evident even with regard to an individual, it
is still more so with regard to a society. The amount of the metal
pieces which are annually paid to an individual, is often precisely
equal to his revenue, and is upon that account the shortest and best
expression of its value. But the amount of the metal pieces which
circulate in a society, can never be equal to the revenue of all its
members. As the same guinea which pays the weekly pension of one man
to-day, may pay that of another to-morrow, and that of a third the day
thereafter, the amount of the metal pieces which annually circulate in
any country, must always be of much less value than the whole money
pensions annually paid with them. But the power of purchasing, or<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt677" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt677_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 the goods which can successively be bought with the whole of those
money pensions as they are successively paid, must always be precisely <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>275<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of the same value with those pensions; as must likewise be the revenue
of the different persons to whom they are paid. That revenue, therefore,
 cannot consist in those metal pieces, of which the amount is so much
inferior to its value, but in the power of purchasing, in the goods
which can successively be bought with them as they circulate from hand
to hand.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_902">Money, therefore, the great wheel of circulation, the great instrument<span class="type-margin"><span>Money is therefore no part of the revenue of the society.</span></span>
 of commerce, like all other instruments of trade, though it makes a
part and a very valuable part of the capital, makes no part of the
revenue of the society to which it belongs; and though the metal pieces
of which it is composed, in the course of their annual circulation,
distribute to every man the revenue which properly belongs to him, they
make themselves no part of that revenue.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_903">Thirdly, and lastly, the machines and instruments of trade, &amp;c.<span class="type-margin"><span>(3) Every saving in the cost of maintaining the stock of money is an improvement.</span></span>
 which compose the fixed capital, bear this further resemblance to that
part of the circulating capital which consists in money; that as every
saving in the expence of erecting and supporting those machines, which
does not diminish the productive powers of labour, is an improvement of
the neat revenue of the society; so every saving in the expence of
collecting and supporting that part of the circulating capital which
consists in money, is an improvement of exactly the same kind.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_904">It is sufficiently obvious, and it has partly
too been explained already, in what manner every saving in the expence
of supporting the fixed capital is an improvement of the neat revenue of
 the society. The whole capital of the undertaker of every work is
necessarily divided between his fixed and his circulating capital. While
 his whole capital remains the same, the smaller the one part, the
greater must necessarily be the other. It is the circulating capital
which furnishes the materials and wages of labour, and puts industry
into motion. Every saving, therefore, in the expence of maintaining the
fixed capital, which does not diminish the productive powers of labour,
must increase the fund which puts industry into motion, and consequently
 the annual produce of land and labour, the real revenue of every
society.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_905">The substitution of paper in the room of gold and silver money,<span class="type-margin"><span>The substitution of paper for gold money is an improvement.</span></span>
 replaces a very expensive instrument of commerce with one much less
costly, and sometimes equally convenient. Circulation comes to be
carried on by a new wheel, which it costs less both to erect and to
maintain than the old one. But in what manner this operation is
performed, and in what manner it tends to increase either the gross or
the neat revenue of the society, is not altogether so obvious, and may
therefore require some further explication.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>276<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_906"><span class="type-margin"><span>Bank notes are the best sort of paper money.</span></span>There
 are several different sorts of paper money; but the circulating notes
of banks and bankers are the species which is best known, and which
seems best adapted for this purpose.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_907">When the people of any particular country have
 such confidence in the fortune, probity, and prudence of a particular
banker, as to believe that he is always ready to pay upon demand such of
 his promissory notes as are likely to be at any time presented to him;
those notes come to have the same currency as gold and silver money,
from the confidence that such money can at any time be had for them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_908"><span class="type-margin"><span>When a banker
lends out £100,000 in notes and keeps in hand only £20,000 in gold and
silver, £80,000 in gold and silver is spared from the circulation:</span></span>A
 particular banker lends among his customers his own promissory notes,
to the extent, we shall suppose, of a hundred thousand pounds. As those
notes serve all the purposes of money, his debtors pay him the same
interest as if he had lent them so much money. This interest is the
source of his gain. Though some of those notes are continually coming
back upon him for payment, part of them continue to circulate for months
 and years together. Though he has generally in circulation, therefore,
notes to the extent of a hundred thousand pounds, twenty thousand pounds
 in gold and silver may, frequently, be a sufficient provision for
answering occasional demands. By this operation, therefore, twenty
thousand pounds in gold and silver perform all the functions which a
hundred thousand could otherwise have performed. The same exchanges may
be made, the same quantity of consumable goods may be circulated and
distributed to their proper consumers, by means of his promissory notes,
 to the value of a hundred thousand pounds, as by an equal value of gold
 and silver money. Eighty thousand pounds of gold and silver, therefore,
 can, in this manner, be spared from the circulation of the country; and
 if different operations of the same kind should, at the same time, be
carried on by many different banks and bankers, the whole circulation
may thus be conducted with a fifth part only of the gold and silver
which would otherwise have been requisite.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_909"><span class="type-margin"><span>and if many bankers do the same, four-fifths of the gold and silver previously circulating may be sent abroad,</span></span>Let
 us suppose, for example, that the whole circulating money of some
particular country amounted, at a particular time, to one million
sterling, that sum being then sufficient for circulating the whole
annual produce of their land and labour. Let us suppose too, that some
time thereafter, different banks and bankers issued promissory notes,
payable to the bearer, to the extent of one million, reserving in their
different coffers two hundred thousand pounds for answering occasional
demands. There would remain, therefore, in circulation, eight hundred
thousand pounds in gold and silver, and a million of bank notes, or
eighteen hundred thousand pounds of paper and money <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>277<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 together. But the annual produce of the land and labour of the country
had before required only one million to circulate and distribute it to
its proper consumers, and that annual produce cannot be immediately
augmented by those operations of banking. One million, therefore, will
be sufficient to circulate it after them. The goods to be bought and
sold being precisely the same as before, the same quantity of money will
 be sufficient for buying and selling them. The channel of circulation,
if I may be allowed such an expression, will remain precisely the same
as before. One million we have supposed sufficient to fill that channel.
 Whatever, therefore, is poured into it beyond this sum, cannot run in
it, but must overflow. One million eight hundred thousand pounds are
poured into it. Eight hundred thousand pounds, therefore, must overflow,
 that sum being over and above what can be employed in the circulation
of the country. But though this sum cannot be employed at home, it is
too valuable to be allowed to lie idle. It will, therefore, be sent
abroad, in order to seek that profitable employment which it cannot find
 at home. But the paper cannot go abroad; because at a distance from the
 banks which issue it, and from the country in which payment of it can
be exacted by law, it will not be received in common payments. Gold and
silver, therefore, to the amount of eight hundred thousand pounds will
be sent abroad, and the channel of home circulation will remain filled
with a million of paper, instead of the million of those metals which
filled it before.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_910">But though so great a quantity of gold and silver is thus sent abroad,<span class="type-margin"><span>and exchanged for goods.</span></span>
 we must not imagine that it is sent abroad for nothing, or that its
proprietors make a present of it to foreign nations. They will exchange
it for foreign goods of some kind or another, in order to supply the
consumption either of some other foreign country, or of their own.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_911">If they employ it in purchasing goods in one foreign country in<span class="type-margin"><span>either
 to supply the consumption of another country, in which case the profit
will be an addition to the net revenue of the country,</span></span>
order to supply the consumption of another, or in what is called the
carrying trade, whatever profit they make will be an addition to the
neat revenue of their own country. It is like a new fund, created for
carrying on a new trade; domestic business being now transacted by
paper, and the gold and silver being converted into a fund for this new
trade.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_912">If they employ it in purchasing foreign goods
for home consumption, they may either, first, purchase such goods as are
 likely to be consumed by idle people who produce nothing, such as
foreign wines, foreign silks, &amp;c.;<span class="type-margin"><span>or
 to supply home consumption (1) of luxuries, (2) of materials, tools and
 provisions wherewith industrious people are maintained and employed.</span></span> or, secondly, they may purchase an additional stock of materials, tools, and provisions, in order to maintain and employ an <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>278<span class="bracket">]</span></span> additional number of industrious people, who re-produce, with a profit, the value of their annual consumption.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_913">So far as it is employed in the first way, it
promotes prodigality, increases expence and consumption without
increasing production, or establishing any permanent fund for supporting
 that expence, and is in every respect hurtful to the society.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_914"><span class="type-margin"><span>If to supply
luxuries, prodigality and consumption are increased, if to supply
materials, &amp;c., a permanent fund for supporting consumption is
provided.</span></span>So far as it is employed in the second way, it
promotes industry; and though it increases the consumption of the
society, it provides a permanent fund for supporting that consumption,
the people who consume re-producing, with a profit, the whole value of
their annual consumption. The gross revenue of the society, the annual
produce of their land and labour, is increased by the whole value which
the labour of those workmen adds to the materials upon which they are
employed; and their neat revenue by what remains of this value, after
deducting what is necessary for supporting the tools and instruments of
their trade.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_915"><span class="type-margin"><span>The greater part of the gold and silver sent abroad purchases materials, &amp;c.</span></span>That
 the greater part of the gold and silver which, being forced abroad by
those operations of banking, is employed in purchasing foreign goods for
 home consumption, is and must be employed in purchasing those of this
second kind, seems not only probable but almost unavoidable. Though some
 particular men may sometimes increase their expence very considerably
though their revenue does not increase at all, we may be assured that no
 class or order of men ever does so; because, though the principles of
common prudence do not always govern the conduct of every individual,
they always influence that of the majority of every class or order. But
the revenue of idle people, considered as a class or order, cannot, in
the smallest degree, be increased by those operations of banking. Their
expence in general, therefore, cannot be much increased by them, though
that of a few individuals among them may, and in reality sometimes is.
The demand of idle people, therefore, for foreign goods, being the same,
 or very nearly the same, as before, a very small part of the money,
which being forced abroad by those operations of banking, is employed in
 purchasing foreign goods for home consumption, is likely to be employed
 in purchasing those for their use. The greater part of it will
naturally be destined for the employment of industry, and not for the
maintenance of idleness.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_916"><span class="type-margin"><span>The quantity
of industry which the circulating capital can employ is determined by
the provisions, materials, and finished work, and not at all by the
quantity of money.</span></span>When we compute the quantity of industry
 which the circulating capital of any society can employ, we must always
 have regard to those parts of it only, which consist in provisions,
materials, and finished work: the other, which consists in money, and
which serves only to <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>279<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 circulate those three, must always be deducted. In order to put
industry into motion, three things are requisite; materials to work
upon, tools to work with, and the wages or recompence for the sake of
which the work is done. Money is neither a material to work upon, nor a
tool to work with; and though the wages of the workman are commonly paid
 to him in money, his real revenue, like that of all other men,
consists, not in the money, but in the money’s worth; not in the metal
pieces, but in what can be got for them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_917">The quantity of industry which any capital can
 employ, must, evidently, be equal to the number of workmen whom it can
supply with materials, tools, and a maintenance suitable to the nature
of the work. Money may be requisite for purchasing the materials and
tools of the work, as well as the maintenance of the workmen. But the
quantity of industry which the whole capital can employ, is certainly
not equal both to the money which purchases, and to the materials,
tools, and maintenance, which are purchased with it; but only to one or
other of those two values, and to the latter more properly than to the
former.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_918">When paper is substituted in the room of gold and silver money, the<span class="type-margin"><span>The
 substitution of paper for gold and silver increases the materials,
tools, and maintenance at the expense of the gold and silver money.</span></span>
 quantity of the materials, tools, and maintenance, which the whole
circulating capital can supply, may be increased by the whole value of
gold and silver which used to be employed in purchasing them. The whole
value of the great wheel of circulation and distribution, is added to
the goods which are circulated and distributed by means of it. The
operation, in some measure, resembles that of the undertaker of some
great work, who, in consequence of some improvement in mechanics, takes
down his old machinery, and adds the difference between its price and
that of the new to his circulating capital, to the fund from which he
furnishes materials and wages to his workmen.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt678" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt678_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_919">What is the proportion which the circulating money of any country<span class="type-margin"><span>The quantity of money bears a small proportion to the whole produce, but a large one to that part destined to maintain industry.</span></span>
 bears to the whole value of the annual produce circulated by means of
it, it is, perhaps, impossible to determine. It has been computed by
different authors at a fifth, at a tenth, at a twentieth, and at a
thirtieth part of that value.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt679" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt679_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 But how small soever the proportion which the circulating money may
bear to the whole value of the annual produce, as but a part, and
frequently but a small part, of that produce, is ever destined for the
maintenance of industry, it must always bear a very considerable
proportion to that part. When, therefore, by the substitution of paper,
the gold and silver necessary for circulation is <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>280<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 reduced to, perhaps, a fifth part of the former quantity, if the value
of only the greater part of the other four-fifths be added to the funds
which are destined for the maintenance of industry, it must make a very
considerable addition to the quantity of that industry, and,
consequently, to the value of the annual produce of land and labour.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_920"><span class="type-margin"><span>An operation of this kind has been carried out in Scotland with excellent effects.</span></span>An
 operation of this kind has, within these five-and-twenty or thirty
years, been performed in Scotland, by the erection of new banking
companies in almost every considerable town, and even in some country
villages.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt680" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt680_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The effects of it have been precisely those above described. The
business of the country is almost entirely carried on by means of the
paper of those different banking companies, with which purchases and
payments of all kinds are commonly made. Silver very seldom appears
except in the change of a twenty shillings bank note, and gold still
seldomer. But though the conduct of all those different companies has
not been unexceptionable, and has accordingly required an act of
parliament to regulate it; the country,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt681" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt681_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 notwithstanding, has evidently derived great benefit from their trade. I
 have heard it asserted, that the trade of the city of Glasgow, doubled
in about fifteen years after the first erection of the banks there; and
that the trade of Scotland has more than quadrupled since the first
erection of the two public banks at Edinburgh, of which the one, called
The Bank of Scotland, was established by act of parliament in 1695; the
other, called The Royal Bank, by royal charter in 1727.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt682" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt682_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 Whether the trade, either of Scotland in general, or of the city of
Glasgow in particular, has really increased in so great a proportion,
during so short a period, I do not pretend to know. If either of them
has increased in this proportion, it seems to be an effect too great to
be accounted for by the sole operation of this cause. That the trade and
 industry of Scotland, however, have increased very considerably during
this period, and that the banks have contributed a good deal to this
increase, cannot be doubted.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_921"><span class="type-margin"><span>There was at the Union at least a million sterling of gold and silver money, and now there is not half a million.</span></span>The
 value of the silver money which circulated in Scotland before the
union, in 1707, and which, immediately after it, was brought into the
bank of Scotland in order to be re-coined, amounted to 411,117 <span class="ital">l.</span> 10 <span class="ital">s.</span> 9 <span class="ital">d.</span>
 sterling. No account has been got of the gold coin; but it appears from
 the ancient accounts of the mint of Scotland, that the value of the
gold annually coined somewhat exceeded that of the silver.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt683" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt683_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> There were a good many people too upon this occasion, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>281<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 who, from a diffidence of repayment, did not bring their silver into
the bank of Scotland: and there was, besides, some English coin, which
was not called in.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt684" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt684_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The whole value of the gold and silver, therefore, which circulated in
Scotland before the union, cannot be estimated at less than a million
sterling. It seems to have constituted almost the whole circulation of
that country; for though the circulation of the bank of Scotland, which
had then no rival, was considerable, it seems to have made but a very
small part of the whole. In the present times the whole circulation of
Scotland cannot be estimated at less than two millions, of which that
part which consists in gold and silver, most probably, does not amount
to half a million. But though the circulating gold and silver of
Scotland have suffered so great a diminution during this period, its
real riches and prosperity do not appear to have suffered any. Its
agriculture, manufactures, and trade, on the contrary, the annual
produce of its land and labour, have evidently been augmented.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_922">It is chiefly by discounting bills of exchange, that is, by advancing<span class="type-margin"><span>Notes are ordinarily issued by discounting bills,</span></span>
 money upon them before they are due, that the greater part of banks and
 bankers issue their promissory notes. They deduct always, upon whatever
 sum they advance, the legal interest till the bill shall become due.
The payment of the bill, when it becomes due, replaces to the bank the
value of what had been advanced, together with a clear profit of the
interest. The banker who advances to the merchant whose bill he
discounts, not gold and silver, but his own promissory notes, has the
advantage of being able to discount to a greater amount by the whole
value of his promissory notes, which he finds by experience, are
commonly in circulation. He is thereby enabled to make his clear gain of
 interest on so much a larger sum.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_923">The commerce of Scotland, which at present is not very great, was<span class="type-margin"><span>but the Scotch banks in vented the system of cash accounts,</span></span>
 still more inconsiderable when the two first banking companies were
established; and those companies would have had but little trade, had
they confined their business to the discounting of bills of exchange.
They invented, therefore, another method of issuing their promissory
notes; by granting, what they called, cash accounts, that is by giving
credit to the extent of a certain sum (two or three thousand pounds, for
 example), to any individual who could procure two persons of undoubted
credit and good landed estate to become surety for him, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>282<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 that whatever money should be advanced to him, within the sum for which
 the credit had been given, should be repaid upon demand, together with
the legal interest. Credits of this kind are, I believe, commonly
granted by banks and bankers in all different parts of the world. But
the easy terms upon which the Scotch banking companies accept of
re-payment are, so far as I know, peculiar to them, and have, perhaps,
been the principal cause, both of the great trade of those companies,
and of the benefit which the country has received from it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_924"><span class="type-margin"><span>which enable them to issue notes readily,</span></span>Whoever
 has a credit of this kind with one of those companies, and borrows a
thousand pounds upon it, for example, may repay this sum piece-meal, by
twenty and thirty pounds at a time, the company discounting a
proportionable part of the interest of the great sum from the day on
which each of those small sums is paid in, till the whole be in this
manner repaid. All merchants, therefore, and almost all men of business,
 find it convenient to keep such cash accounts with them, and are
thereby interested to promote the trade of those companies, by readily
receiving their notes in all payments, and by encouraging all those with
 whom they have any influence to do the same. The banks, when their
customers apply to them for money, generally advance it to them in their
 own promissory notes. These the merchants pay away to the manufacturers
 for goods, the manufacturers to the farmers for materials and
provisions, the farmers to their landlords for rent, the landlords repay
 them to the merchants for the conveniencies and luxuries with which
they supply them, and the merchants again return them to the banks in
order to balance their cash accounts, or to replace what they may have
borrowed of them; and thus almost the whole money business of the
country is transacted by means of them. Hence the great trade of those
companies.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_925"><span class="type-margin"><span>and make it possible for every merchant to carry on a greater trade than he otherwise could.</span></span>By
 means of those cash accounts every merchant can, without imprudence,
carry on a greater trade than he otherwise could do. If there are two
merchants, one in London, and the other in Edinburgh, who employ equal
stocks in the same branch of trade, the Edinburgh merchant can, without
imprudence, carry on a greater trade, and give employment to a greater
number of people than the London merchant. The London merchant must
always keep by him a considerable sum of money, either in his own
coffers, or in those of his banker, who gives him no interest for it, in
 order to answer the demands continually coming upon him for payment of
the goods which he purchases upon credit. Let the ordinary amount of
this sum be supposed five hundred pounds. The value of the goods in his
warehouse must always be less by five hundred pounds than it would have
been, had he not been <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>283<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 obliged to keep such a sum unemployed. Let us suppose that he generally
 disposes of his whole stock upon hand, or of goods to the value of his
whole stock upon hand, once in the year. By being obliged to keep so
great a sum unemployed, he must sell in a year five hundred pounds worth
 less goods than he might otherwise have done. His annual profits must
be less by all that he could have made by the sale of five hundred
pounds worth more goods; and the number of people employed in preparing
his goods for the market, must be less by all those that five hundred
pounds more stock could have employed. The merchant in Edinburgh, on the
 other hand, keeps no money unemployed for answering such occasional
demands. When they actually come upon him, he satisfies them from his
cash account with the bank, and gradually replaces the sum borrowed with
 the money or paper which comes in from the occasional sales of his
goods. With the same stock, therefore, he can, without imprudence, have
at all times in his warehouse a larger quantity of goods than the London
 merchant; and can thereby both make a greater profit himself, and give
constant employment to a greater number of industrious people who
prepare those goods for the market. Hence the great benefit which the
country has derived from this trade.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_926">The facility of discounting bills of exchange, it may be thought<span class="type-margin"><span>The Scotch banks can of course discount bills when required.</span></span>
 indeed, gives the English merchants a conveniency equivalent to the
cash accounts of the Scotch merchants. But the Scotch merchants, it must
 be remembered, can discount their bills of exchange as easily as the
English merchants; and have, besides, the additional conveniency of
their cash accounts.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_927">The whole paper money of every kind which can easily circulate in<span class="type-margin"><span>The whole of the paper money can never exceed the gold and silver which would have been required in its absence.</span></span>
 any country never can exceed the value of the gold and silver, of which
 it supplies the place, or which (the commerce being supposed the same)
would circulate there, if there was no paper money. If twenty shilling
notes, for example, are the lowest paper money current in Scotland, the
whole of that currency which can easily circulate there cannot exceed
the sum of gold and silver which would be necessary for transacting the
annual exchanges of twenty shillings value and upwards usually
transacted within that country. Should the circulating paper at any time
 exceed that sum, as the excess could neither be sent abroad nor be
employed in the circulation of the country, it must immediately return
upon the banks to be exchanged for gold and silver. Many people would
immediately perceive that they had more of this paper than was necessary
 for transacting their business at home, and as they could not send it
abroad, they would immediately demand payment of it from <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>284<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 the banks. When this superfluous paper was converted into gold and
silver, they could easily find a use for it by sending it abroad; but
they could find none while it remained in the shape of paper. There
would immediately, therefore, be a run upon the banks to the whole
extent of this superfluous paper, and, if they shewed any difficulty or
backwardness in payment, to a much greater extent; the alarm, which this
 would occasion, necessarily increasing the run.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_928"><span class="type-margin"><span>The peculiar expenses of a bank are (1) the keeping and (2) the replenishing of a stock of money with which to repay notes.</span></span>Over
 and above the expences which are common to every branch of trade; such
as the expence of house-rent, the wages of servants, clerks,
accountants, &amp;c.; the expences peculiar to a bank consist chiefly in
 two articles: First, in the expence of keeping at all times in its
coffers, for answering the occasional demands of the holders of its
notes, a large sum of money, of which it loses the interest: And,
secondly, in the expence of replenishing those coffers as fast as they
are emptied by answering such occasional demands.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_929"><span class="type-margin"><span>A bank which issues too much paper will much increase both the first</span></span>A
 banking company, which issues more paper than can be employed in the
circulation of the country, and of which the excess is continually
returning upon them for payment, ought to increase the quantity of gold
and silver, which they keep at all times in their coffers, not only in
proportion to this excessive increase of their circulation, but in a
much greater proportion; their notes returning upon them much faster
than in proportion to the excess of their quantity. Such a company,
therefore, ought to increase the first article of their expence, not
only in proportion to this forced increase of their business, but in a
much greater proportion.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_930"><span class="type-margin"><span>and the second expense.</span></span>The
 coffers of such a company too, though they ought to be filled much
fuller, yet must empty themselves much faster than if their business was
 confined within more reasonable bounds, and must require, not only a
more violent, but a more constant and uninterrupted exertion of expence
in order to replenish them. The coin too, which is thus continually
drawn in such large quantities from their coffers, cannot be employed in
 the circulation of the country. It comes in place of a paper which is
over and above what can be employed in that circulation, and is
therefore over and above what can be employed in it too. But as that
coin will not be allowed to lie idle, it must, in one shape or another,
be sent abroad, in order to find that profitable employment which it
cannot find at home; and this continual exportation of gold and silver,
by enhancing the difficulty, must necessarily enhance still further the
expence of the bank, in finding new gold and silver in order to
replenish those coffers, which empty themselves so very rapidly. Such a
company, therefore, must, in proportion to this forced <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>285<span class="bracket">]</span></span> increase of their business, increase the second article of their expence still more than the first.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_931">Let us suppose that all the paper of a particular bank, which the circulation<span class="type-margin"><span>as may be shown by an example.</span></span>
 of the country can easily absorb and employ, amounts exactly to forty
thousand pounds; and that for answering occasional demands, this bank is
 obliged to keep at all times in its coffers ten thousand pounds in gold
 and silver. Should this bank attempt to circulate forty-four thousand
pounds, the four thousand pounds which are over and above what the
circulation can easily absorb and employ, will return upon it almost as
fast as they are issued. For answering occasional demands, therefore,
this bank ought to keep at all times in its coffers, not eleven thousand
 pounds only, but fourteen thousand pounds. It will thus gain nothing by
 the interest of the four thousand pounds excessive circulation; and it
will lose the whole expence of continually collecting four thousand
pounds in gold and silver, which will be continually going out of its
coffers as fast as they are brought into them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_932">Had every particular banking company always understood and<span class="type-margin"><span>Banks have sometimes not understood this,</span></span>
 attended to its own particular interest, the circulation never could
have been overstocked with paper money. But every particular banking
company has not always understood or attended to its own particular
interest, and the circulation has frequently been overstocked with paper
 money.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_933">By issuing too great a quantity of paper, of which the excess was<span class="type-margin"><span><span class="ital">e.g.,</span> the Bank of England,</span></span>
 continually returning, in order to be exchanged for gold and silver,
the bank of England was for many years together obliged to coin gold to
the extent of between eight hundred thousand pounds and a million a
year; or at an average, about eight hundred and fifty thousand pounds.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt685" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt685_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 For this great coinage the bank (in consequence of the worn and
degraded state into which the gold coin had fallen a few years ago) was
frequently obliged to purchase gold bullion at the high price of four
pounds an ounce, which it soon after issued in coin at 3 <span class="ital">l.</span> 17 <span class="ital">s.</span> 10½ <span class="ital">d.</span>
 an ounce, losing in this manner between two and a half and three per
cent. upon the coinage of so very large a sum. Though the bank therefore
 paid no seignorage, though the government was properly at the expence
of the coinage, this liberality of government did not prevent altogether
 the expence of the bank.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>286<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_934"><span class="type-margin"><span>and the Scotch banks.</span></span>The
 Scotch banks, in consequence of an excess of the same kind, were all
obliged to employ constantly agents at London to collect money for them,
 at an expence which was seldom below one and a half or two per cent.
This money was sent down by the waggon, and insured by the carriers at
an additional expence of three quarters per cent. or fifteen shillings
on the hundred pounds. Those agents were not always able to replenish
the coffers of their employers so fast as they were emptied. In this
case the resource of the banks was, to draw upon their correspondents in
 London bills of exchange to the extent of the sum which they wanted.
When those correspondents afterwards drew upon them for the payment of
this sum, together with the interest and a commission, some of those
banks, from the distress into which their excessive circulation had
thrown them, had sometimes no other means of satisfying this draught but
 by drawing a second set of bills either upon the same, or upon some
other correspondents in London; and the same sum, or rather bills for
the same sum, would in this manner make sometimes more than two or three
 journies: the debtor bank, paying always the interest and commission
upon the whole accumulated sum. Even those Scotch banks which never
distinguished themselves by their extreme imprudence, were sometimes
obliged to employ this ruinous resource.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_935">The gold coin which was paid out either by the
 bank of England, or by the Scotch banks, in exchange for that part of
their paper which was over and above what could be employed in the
circulation of the country, being likewise over and above what could be
employed in that circulation, was sometimes sent abroad in the shape of
coin, sometimes melted down and sent abroad in the shape of bullion, and
 sometimes melted down and sold to the bank of England at the high price
 of four pounds an ounce. It was the newest, the heaviest, and the best
pieces only which were carefully picked out of the whole coin, and
either sent abroad or melted down. At home, and while they remained<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt686" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt686_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 in the shape of coin, those heavy pieces were of no more value than the
 light: But they were of more value abroad, or when melted down into
bullion, at home. The bank of England, notwithstanding their great
annual coinage, found to their astonishment, that there was every year
the same scarcity of coin as there had been the year before; and that
notwithstanding the great quantity of good and new coin which was every
year issued from the bank, the state of the coin, instead of growing
better and better, became every year worse and worse. Every year they
found themselves under the necessity of coining <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>287<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 nearly the same quantity of gold as they had coined the year before,
and from the continual rise in the price of gold bullion, in consequence
 of the continual wearing and clipping of the coin, the expence of this
great annual coinage became every year greater and greater. The bank of
England, it is to be observed, by supplying its own coffers with coin,
is indirectly obliged to supply the whole kingdom, into which coin is
continually flowing from those coffers in a great variety of ways.
Whatever coin therefore was wanted to support this excessive circulation
 both of Scotch and English paper money, whatever vacuities this
excessive circulation occasioned in the necessary coin of the kingdom,
the bank of England was obliged to supply them. The Scotch banks, no
doubt, paid all of them very dearly for their own imprudence and
inattention. But the bank of England paid very dearly, not only for its
own imprudence, but for the much greater imprudence of almost all the
Scotch banks.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_936">The over-trading of some bold projectors in both parts of the united<span class="type-margin"><span>The excessive circulation was caused by overtrading</span></span> kingdom, was the original cause of this excessive circulation of paper money.</p>

 of any kind, is not either the whole capital with which he trades, or
even any considerable part of that capital; but that part of it only,
which he would otherwise be obliged to keep by him unemployed, and in
ready money for answering occasional demands. If the paper money which
the bank advances never exceeds this value, it can never exceed the
value of the gold and silver, which would necessarily circulate in the
country if there was no paper money; it can never exceed the quantity
which the circulation of the country can easily absorb and employ.</p>

 by a real creditor upon a real debtor, and which, as soon as it becomes
 due, is really paid by that debtor; it only advances to him a part of
the value which he would otherwise be obliged to keep by him unemployed
and in ready money for answering occasional demands. The payment of the
bill, when it becomes due, replaces to the bank the value of what it had
 advanced, together with the interest. The coffers of the bank, so far
as its dealings are confined to such customers, resemble a water pond,
from which, though a stream is continually running out, yet another is
continually running in, fully equal to that which runs out; so that,
without any further care or attention, the pond keeps always equally, or
 very near equally full. Little or no expence can ever be necessary for
replenishing the coffers of such a bank.</p>

<p id="Smith_0206-01_939"><span class="type-margin"><span>Cash accounts should be carefully watched to secure the same end,</span></span>A
 merchant, without over-trading, may frequently have occasion for a sum
of ready money, even when he has no bills to discount. When a bank,
besides discounting his bills, advances him likewise upon such
occasions, such sums upon his cash account, and accepts of a piece meal
repayment as the money comes in from the occasional sale of his goods,
upon the easy terms of the banking companies of Scotland; it dispenses
him entirely from the necessity of keeping any part of his stock by him
unemployed and in ready money for answering occasional demands. When
such demands actually come upon him, he can answer them sufficiently
from his cash account. The bank, however, in dealing with such
customers, ought to observe with great attention, whether in the course
of some short period (of four, five, six, or eight months, for example)
the sum of the repayments which it commonly receives from them, is, or
is not, fully equal to that of the advances which it commonly makes to
them. If, within the course of such short periods, the sum of the
repayments from certain customers is, upon most occasions, fully equal
to that of the advances, it may safely continue to deal with such
customers. Though the stream which is in this case continually running
out from its coffers may be very large, that which is continually
running into them must be at least equally large; so that without any
further care or attention those coffers are likely to be always equally
or very near equally full; and scarce ever to require any extraordinary
expence to replenish them. If, on the contrary, the sum of the
repayments from certain other customers falls commonly very much short
of the advances which it makes to them, it cannot with any safety
continue to deal with such customers, at least if they continue to deal
with it in this manner. The stream which is in this case continually
running out from its coffers is necessarily much larger than that which
is continually running in; so that, unless they are replenished by some
great and continual effort of expence, those coffers must soon be
exhausted altogether.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_940"><span class="type-margin"><span>as they were for a long time by the Scotch banks, which required frequent and regular operations,</span></span>The
 banking companies of Scotland, accordingly, were for a long time very
careful to require frequent and regular repayments from all their
customers, and did not care to deal with any person, whatever might be
his fortune or credit, who did not make, what they called, frequent and
regular operations with them. By this attention, besides saving almost
entirely the extraordinary expence of replenishing their coffers, they
gained two other very considerable advantages.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_941"><span class="type-margin"><span>and thus (1) were able to judge of the circumstances of their debtors,</span></span>First,
 by this attention they were enabled to make some tolerable judgment
concerning the thriving or declining circumstances of their debtors,
without being obliged to look out for any other evidence <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>289<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 besides what their own books afforded them; men being for the most part
 either regular or irregular in their repayments, according as their
circumstances are either thriving or declining. A private man who lends
out his money to perhaps half a dozen or a dozen of debtors, may, either
 by himself or his agents, observe and enquire both constantly and
carefully into the conduct and situation of each of them. But a banking
company, which lends money to perhaps five hundred different people, and
 of which the attention is continually occupied by objects of a very
different kind, can have no regular information concerning the conduct
and circumstances of the greater part of its debtors beyond what its own
 books afford it.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt687" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt687_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 In requiring frequent and regular repayments from all their customers,
the banking companies of Scotland had probably this advantage in view.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_942">Secondly, by this attention they secured themselves from the<span class="type-margin"><span>and (2) were secured against issuing too much paper.</span></span>
 possibility of issuing more paper money than what the circulation of
the country could easily absorb and employ. When they observed, that
within moderate periods of time the repayments of a particular customer
were upon most occasions fully equal to the advances which they had made
 to him, they might be assured that the paper money which they had
advanced to him, had not at any time exceeded the quantity of gold and
silver which he would otherwise have been obliged to keep by him for
answering occasional demands; and that, consequently, the paper money,
which they had circulated by his means, had not at any time exceeded the
 quantity of gold and silver which would have circulated in the country,
 had there been no paper money. The frequency, regularity and amounts of
 his repayments would sufficiently demonstrate that the amount of their
advances had at no time exceeded that part of his capital which he would
 otherwise have been obliged to keep by him unemployed and in ready
money for answering occasional demands; that is, for the purpose of
keeping the rest of his capital in constant employment. It is this part
of his capital only which, within moderate periods of time, is
continually returning to every dealer in the shape of money, whether
paper or coin, and continually going from him in the same shape. If the
advances of the bank had commonly exceeded this part of his capital, the
 ordinary amount of his repayments could not, within moderate periods of
 time, have equalled the ordinary amount of its advances. The stream
which, by means of his dealings, was continually running into the
coffers of the bank, could not have been equal to the stream <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>290<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 which, by means of the same dealings, was continually running out. The
advances of the bank paper, by exceeding the quantity of gold and silver
 which, had there been no such advances, he would have been obliged to
keep by him for answering occasional demands, might soon come to exceed
the whole quantity of gold and silver which (the commerce being supposed
 the same) would have circulated in the country had there been no paper
money; and consequently to exceed the quantity which the circulation of
the country could easily absorb and employ; and the excess of this paper
 money would immediately have returned upon the bank in order to be
exchanged for gold and silver. This second advantage, though equally
real, was not perhaps so well understood by all the different banking
companies of Scotland as the first.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_943"><span class="type-margin"><span>Bankers’ loans ought to be only for moderate periods of time.</span></span>When,
 partly by the conveniency of discounting bills, and partly by that of
cash accounts, the creditable traders of any country can be dispensed
from the necessity of keeping any part of their stock by them unemployed
 and in ready money for answering occasional demands, they can
reasonably expect no farther assistance from banks and bankers, who,
when they have gone thus far, cannot, consistently with their own
interest and safety, go farther. A bank cannot, consistently with its
own interest, advance to a trader the whole or even the greater part of
the circulating capital with which he trades; because, though that
capital is continually returning to him in the shape of money, and going
 from him in the same shape, yet the whole of the returns is too distant
 from the whole of the outgoings, and the sum of his repayments could
not equal the sum of its advances within such moderate periods of time
as suit the conveniency of a bank. Still less could a bank afford to
advance him any considerable part of his fixed capital; of the capital
which the undertaker of an iron forge, for example, employs in erecting
his forge and smelting-house, his work-houses and warehouses, the
dwelling-houses of his workmen, &amp;c.; of the capital which the
undertaker of a mine employs in sinking his shafts, in erecting engines
for drawing out the water, in making roads and waggon-ways, &amp;c.; of
the capital which the person who undertakes to improve land employs in
clearing, draining, enclosing, manuring and ploughing waste and
uncultivated fields, in building farm-houses, with all their necessary
appendages of stables, granaries, &amp;c. The returns of the fixed
capital are in almost all cases much slower than those of the
circulating capital; and such expences, even when laid out with the
greatest prudence and judgment, very seldom return to the undertaker
till after a period of many years, a period by far too distant to suit
the conveniency of a <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>291<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 bank. Traders and other undertakers may, no doubt, with great
propriety, carry on a very considerable part of their projects with
borrowed money. In justice to their creditors, however, their own
capital ought, in this case, to be sufficient to ensure, if I may say
so, the capital of those creditors; or to render it extremely improbable
 that those creditors should incur any loss, even though the success of
the project should fall very much short of the expectation of the
projectors. Even with this precaution too, the money which is borrowed,
and which it is meant should not be repaid till after a period of
several years, ought not to be borrowed of a bank, but ought to be
borrowed upon bond or mortgage, of such private people as propose to
live upon the interest of their money, without taking the trouble
themselves to employ the capital; and who are upon that account willing
to lend that capital to such people of good credit as are likely to keep
 it for several years. A bank, indeed, which lends its money without the
 expence of stampt paper, or of attornies fees for drawing bonds and
mortgages, and which accepts of repayment upon the easy terms of the
banking companies of Scotland; would, no doubt, be a very convenient
creditor to such traders and undertakers. But such traders and
undertakers would, surely, be most inconvenient debtors to such a bank.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_944">It is now more than five-and-twenty years since the paper money<span class="type-margin"><span>More than twenty-five years ago the proper amount of paper money had been reached in Scotland,</span></span>
 issued by the different banking companies of Scotland was fully equal,
or rather was somewhat more than fully equal, to what the circulation of
 the country could easily absorb and employ.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt688" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt688_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Those companies, therefore, had so long ago given all the assistance to
 the traders and other undertakers of Scotland which it is possible for
banks and bankers, consistently with their own interest, to give. They
had even done somewhat more. They had over-traded a little, and had
brought upon themselves that loss, or at least that diminution of
profit, which in this particular business never fails to attend the
smallest degree of overtrading. Those traders and other undertakers,
having got so much<span class="type-margin"><span>but the traders were not content,</span></span>
 assistance from banks and bankers, wished to get still more. The banks,
 they seem to have thought, could extend their credits to whatever sum
might be wanted, without incurring any other expence besides that of a
few reams of paper. They complained of the contracted views and
dastardly spirit of the directors of those banks, which did not, they
said, extend their credits in proportion to the extension of the trade
of the country; meaning, no doubt, by the extension of that trade the
extension of their own projects beyond what they could <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>292<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 carry on, either with their own capital, or with what they had credit
to borrow of private people in the usual way of bond or mortgage. The
banks, they seem to have thought, were in honour bound to supply the
deficiency, and to provide them with all the capital which they wanted
to trade with. The banks, however, were of a different opinion, and upon
 their refusing to extend their credits, some of those traders had
recourse to an expedient which, for a time, served their purpose, though
 at a much greater expence, yet as effectually as the<span class="type-margin"><span>and some of them resorted to drawing and redrawing,</span></span>
 utmost extension of bank credits could have done. This expedient was no
 other than the well-known shift of drawing and re-drawing; the shift to
 which unfortunate traders have sometimes recourse when they are upon
the brink of bankruptcy. The practice of raising money in this manner
had been long known in England, and during the course of the late war,
when the high profits of trade afforded a great temptation to
over-trading, is said to have been carried on to a very great extent.
From England it was brought into Scotland, where, in proportion to the
very limited commerce, and to the very moderate capital of the country,
it was soon carried on to a much greater extent than it ever had been in
 England.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_945"><span class="type-margin"><span>which shall be explained</span></span>The
 practice of drawing and re-drawing is so well known to all men of
business, that it may perhaps be thought unnecessary to give any account
 of it. But as this book may come into the hands of many people who are
not men of business, and as the effects of this practice upon the
banking trade are not perhaps generally understood even by men of
business themselves, I shall endeavour to explain it as distinctly as I
can.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_946"><span class="type-margin"><span>Bills of exchange have extraordinary legal privileges.</span></span>The
 customs of merchants, which were established when the barbarous laws of
 Europe did not enforce the performance of their contracts, and which
during the course of the two last centuries have been adopted into the
laws of all European nations, have given such extraordinary privileges
to bills of exchange, that money is more readily advanced upon them,
than upon any other species of obligation; especially when they are made
 payable within so short a period as two or three months after their
date. If, when the bill becomes due, the acceptor does not pay it as
soon as it is presented, he becomes from that moment a bankrupt. The
bill is protested, and returns upon the drawer, who, if he does not
immediately pay it, becomes likewise a bankrupt. If, before it came to
the person who presents it to the acceptor for payment, it had passed
through the hands of several other persons, who had successively
advanced to one another the contents of it either in money or goods, and
 who to express that each of them had in his turn received <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>293<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 those contents, had all of them in their order endorsed, that is,
written their names upon the back of the bill; each endorser becomes in
his turn liable to the owner of the bill for those contents, and, if he
fails to pay, he becomes too from that moment a bankrupt. Though the
drawer, acceptor, and endorsers of the bill should, all of them, be
persons of doubtful credit; yet still the shortness of the date gives
some security to the owner of the bill. Though all of them may be very
likely to become bankrupts; it is a chance if they all become so in so
short a time. The house is crazy, says a weary traveller to himself, and
 will not stand very long; but it is a chance if it falls to-night, and I
 will venture, therefore, to sleep in it to-night.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_947">The trader A in Edinburgh, we shall suppose, draws a bill upon B in<span class="type-margin"><span>So two persons, one in London and one in Edinburgh, would draw bills on each other.</span></span>
 London, payable two months after date. In reality B in London owes
nothing to A in Edinburgh; but he agrees to accept of A’s bill, upon
condition that before the term of payment he shall redraw upon A in
Edinburgh for the same sum, together with the interest and a commission,
 another bill, payable likewise two months after date. B accordingly,
before the expiration of the first two months, re-draws this bill upon A
 in Edinburgh; who again, before the expiration of the second two
months, draws a second bill upon B in London, payable likewise two
months after date; and before the expiration of the third two months, B
in London re-draws upon A in Edinburgh another bill, payable also two
months after date. This practice has sometimes gone on, not only for
several months, but for several years together, the bill always
returning upon A in Edinburgh, with the accumulated interest and
commission of all the former bills. The interest was five per cent. in
the year, and the commission was never less than one half per cent. on
each draught. This commission being repeated more than six times in the
year, whatever money A might raise by this expedient must necessarily
have cost him something more than eight per cent. in the year, and
sometimes a great deal more; when either the price of the commission
happened to rise, or when he was obliged to pay compound interest upon
the interest and commission of former bills. This practice was called
raising money by circulation.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_948">In a country where the ordinary profits of stock in the greater part<span class="type-margin"><span>Much money was raised in this expensive way.</span></span>
 of mercantile projects are supposed to run between six and ten per
cent., it must have been a very fortunate speculation of which the
returns could not only repay the enormous expence at which the money was
 thus borrowed for carrying it on; but afford, besides, a good surplus
profit to the projector. Many vast and extensive projects, however, were
 undertaken, and for several years carried on without <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>294<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 any other fund to support them besides what was raised at this enormous
 expence. The projectors, no doubt, had in their golden dreams the most
distinct vision of this great profit. Upon their awaking, however,
either at the end of their projects, or when they were no longer able to
 carry them on, they very seldom, I believe, had the good fortune to
find it.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt689" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt689_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_949"><span class="type-margin"><span>The bill on London would be discounted in Edinburgh, and the bill on Edinburgh discounted in London,</span></span>The
 bills which A in Edinburgh drew upon B in London, he regularly
discounted two months before they were due with some bank or banker in
Edinburgh; and the bills which B in London redrew upon A in Edinburgh,
he as regularly discounted either with the bank of England, or with some
 other bankers in London. Whatever was advanced upon such circulating
bills, was, in Edinburgh, advanced in the paper of the Scotch banks, and
 in London, when they were discounted at the bank of England, in the
paper of that bank. Though the bills upon which this paper had been
advanced, were all of them re-paid in their turn as soon as they became
due; yet the value which had been really advanced upon the first bill,
was never<span class="type-margin"><span>and each was always replaced by another.</span></span>
 really returned to the banks which advanced it; because, before each
bill became due, another bill was always drawn to somewhat a greater
amount than the bill which was soon to be paid; and the discounting of
this other bill was essentially necessary towards the payment of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>295<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 that which was soon to be due. This payment, therefore, was altogether
fictitious. The stream, which, by means of those circulating bills of
exchange, had once been made to run out from the coffers of the banks,
was never replaced by any stream which really run into them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_950">The paper which was issued upon those circulating bills of exchange,<span class="type-margin"><span>The amount thus advanced by the banks was in excess of the limit laid down above, but this was not perceived at first.</span></span>
 amounted, upon many occasions, to the whole fund destined for carrying
on some vast and extensive project of agriculture, commerce, or
manufactures; and not merely to that part of it which, had there been no
 paper money, the projector would have been obliged to keep by him,
unemployed and in ready money for answering occasional demands. The
greater part of this paper was, consequently, over and above the value
of the gold and silver which would have circulated in the country, had
there been no paper money. It was over and above, therefore, what the
circulation of the country could easily absorb and employ, and upon that
 account immediately returned upon the banks in order to be exchanged
for gold and silver, which they were to find as they could. It was a
capital which those projectors had very artfully contrived to draw from
those banks, not only without their knowledge or deliberate consent, but
 for some time, perhaps, without their having the most distant suspicion
 that they had really advanced it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_951">When two people, who are continually drawing and re-drawing<span class="type-margin"><span>When the banks found it out they made difficulties about discounting,</span></span>
 upon one another, discount their bills always with the same banker, he
must immediately discover what they are about, and see clearly that they
 are trading, not with any capital of their own, but with the capital
which he advances to them. But this discovery is not altogether so easy
when they discount their bills sometimes with one banker, and sometimes
with another, and when the same two persons do not constantly draw and
re-draw upon one another, but occasionally run the round of a great
circle of projectors, who find it for their interest to assist one
another in this method of raising money, and to render it, upon that
account, as difficult as possible to distinguish between a real and a
fictitious bill of exchange; between a bill drawn by a real creditor
upon a real debtor, and a bill for which there was properly no real
creditor but the bank which discounted it; nor any real debtor but the
projector who made use of the money. When a banker had even made this
discovery, he might sometimes make it too late, and might find that he
had already discounted the bills of those projectors to so great an
extent, that, by refusing to discount any more, he would necessarily
make them all bankrupts, and thus, by <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>296<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 ruining them, might perhaps ruin himself. For his own interest and
safety, therefore, he might find it necessary, in this very perilous
situation, to go on for some time, endeavouring, however, to withdraw
gradually, and upon that account making every day greater and greater
difficulties about discounting, in order to force those projectors by
degrees to have recourse, either to other bankers, or to other methods
of raising money; so as that he himself might, as soon as possible, get
out of the circle. The difficulties, accordingly, which the bank of
England, which the principal bankers in London, and which even the more
prudent Scotch banks began, after a certain<span class="type-margin"><span>which alarmed and enraged the projectors,</span></span>
 time, and when all of them had already gone too far, to make about
discounting, not only alarmed, but enraged in the highest degree those
projectors. Their own distress, of which this prudent and necessary
reserve of the banks was, no doubt, the immediate occasion, they called
the distress of the country; and this distress of the country, they
said, was altogether owing to the ignorance, pusillanimity, and bad
conduct of the banks, which did not give a sufficiently liberal aid to
the spirited undertakings of those who exerted themselves in order to
beautify, improve, and enrich the country. It was the duty of the banks,
 they seemed to think, to lend for as long a time, and to as great an
extent as they might wish to borrow. The banks, however, by refusing in
this manner to give more credit to those, to whom they had already given
 a great deal too much, took the only method by which it was now
possible to save either their own credit, or the public credit of the
country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_952"><span class="type-margin"><span>then the Ayr bank was established and advanced money very freely,</span></span>In the midst of this clamour and distress, a new bank<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt690" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt690_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 was established in Scotland for the express purpose of relieving the
distress of the country. The design was generous; but the execution was
imprudent, and the nature and causes of the distress which it meant to <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>297<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 relieve, were not, perhaps, well understood. This bank was more liberal
 than any other had ever been, both in granting cash accounts, and in
discounting bills of exchange. With regard to the latter, it seems to
have made scarce any distinction between real and circulating bills, but
 to have discounted all equally. It was the avowed principle of this
bank to advance, upon any reasonable security, the whole capital which
was to be employed in those<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt691" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt691_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 improvements of which the returns are the most slow and distant, such
as the improvements of land. To promote such improvements was even said
to be the chief of the public spirited purposes for which it was
instituted. By its liberality in granting cash accounts, and in
discounting bills of exchange, it, no doubt, issued great quantities of
its bank notes. But those bank notes being, the greater part of them,
over and above what the circulation of the country could easily absorb
and employ, returned upon it, in order to be exchanged for gold and
silver, as fast as they were issued. Its<span class="type-margin"><span>but soon got into difficulties,</span></span>
 coffers were never well filled. The capital which had been subscribed
to this bank at two different subscriptions, amounted to one hundred and
 sixty thousand pounds, of which eighty per cent. only was paid up. This
 sum ought to have been paid in at several different instalments. A
great part of the proprietors, when they paid in their first instalment,
 opened a cash account with the bank; and the directors, thinking
themselves obliged to treat their own proprietors with the same
liberality with which they treated all other men, allowed many of them
to borrow upon this cash account what they paid in upon all their
subsequent instalments. Such payments, therefore, only put into one
coffer, what had the moment before been taken out of another. But had
the coffers of this bank been filled ever so well, its excessive
circulation must have emptied them faster than they could have been
replenished by any other expedient but the ruinous one of drawing upon
London, and when the bill became due, paying it, together with interest
and commission, by another draught upon the same place. Its coffers
having been filled so very ill, it is said to have been driven to this
resource within a very few months after it began to do business. The
estates of the proprietors of this bank were worth several millions, and
 by their subscription to the original bond or contract of the bank,
were really pledged for answering all its engagements.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt692" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt692_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 By means of the great credit which so great a pledge necessarily gave
it, it was, notwithstanding its too liberal conduct, enabled to carry on
 business for <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>298<span class="bracket">]</span></span> more than two years.<span class="type-margin"><span>and was obliged to stop in two years.</span></span>
 When it was obliged to stop, it had in the circulation about two
hundred thousand pounds in bank notes. In order to support the
circulation of those notes, which were continually returning upon it as
fast as they were issued, it had been constantly in the practice of
drawing bills of exchange upon London, of which the number and value
were continually increasing, and, when it stopt, amounted to upwards of
six hundred thousand pounds. This bank, therefore, had, in little more
than the course of two years, advanced to different people upwards of
eight hundred thousand pounds at five per cent. Upon the two hundred
thousand pounds which it circulated in bank notes, this five per cent.
might, perhaps, be considered as clear gain, without any other deduction
 besides the expence of management. But upon upwards of six hundred
thousand pounds, for which it was continually drawing bills of exchange
upon London, it was paying, in the way of interest and commission,
upwards of eight per cent., and was consequently losing more than three
per cent. upon more than three-fourths of all its dealings.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_953"><span class="type-margin"><span>Its action and failure increased the distress of projectors and the country generally,</span></span>The
 operations of this bank seem to have produced effects quite opposite to
 those which were intended by the particular persons who planned and
directed it. They seem to have intended to support the spirited
undertakings, for as such they considered them, which were at that time
carrying on in different parts of the country; and at the same time, by
drawing the whole banking business to themselves, to supplant all the
other Scotch banks; particularly those established at Edinburgh, whose
backwardness in discounting bills of exchange had given some offence.
This bank, no doubt, gave some temporary relief to those projectors, and
 enabled them to carry on their projects for about two years longer than
 they could otherwise have done. But it thereby only enabled them to get
 so much deeper into debt, so that when ruin came, it fell so much the
heavier both upon them and upon their creditors. The operations of this
bank, therefore, instead of relieving, in reality aggravated in the
long-run the distress which those projectors had brought both upon
themselves and upon their country. It would have been much better for
themselves, their creditors and their country, had the greater part of
them been obliged to stop two<span class="type-margin"><span>but relieved the other Scotch banks.</span></span>
 years sooner than they actually did. The temporary relief, however,
which this bank afforded to those projectors, proved a real and
permanent relief to the other Scotch banks. All the dealers in
circulating bills of exchange, which those other banks had become so
backward in discounting, had recourse to this new bank, where they were
received with open arms. Those other banks, therefore, were enabled to
get <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>299<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 very easily out of that fatal circle, from which they could not
otherwise have disengaged themselves without incurring a considerable
loss, and perhaps too even some degree of discredit.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_954">In the long-run, therefore, the operations of
this bank increased the real distress of the country which it meant to
relieve; and effectually relieved from a very great distress those
rivals whom it meant to supplant.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_955">At the first setting out of this bank, it was the opinion of some<span class="type-margin"><span>Another plan would have been to raise money on the securities pledged by borrowers:</span></span>
 people, that how fast soever its coffers might be emptied, it might
easily replenish them by raising money upon the securities of those to
whom it had advanced its paper. Experience, I believe, soon convinced
them that this method of raising money was by much too slow to answer
their purpose; and that coffers which originally were so ill filled, and
 which emptied themselves so very fast, could be replenished by no other
 expedient but the ruinous one of drawing bills upon London, and when
they became due, paying them by other draughts upon the same place with
accumulated interest and commission. But though they had been able by
this method to raise money as fast as they wanted it; yet, instead of
making a profit, they must have suffered a loss by every such operation;
 so that in the long-run they<span class="type-margin"><span>this would have been a losing business,</span></span>
 must have ruined themselves as a mercantile company, though, perhaps,
not so soon as by the more expensive practice of drawing and re-drawing.
 They could still have made nothing by the interest of the paper, which,
 being over and above what the circulation of the country could absorb
and employ, returned upon them, in order to be exchanged for gold and
silver, as fast as they issued it; and for the payment of which they
were themselves continually obliged to borrow money. On the contrary,
the whole expence of this borrowing, of employing agents to look out for
 people who had money to lend, of negociating with those people, and of
drawing the proper bond or assignment, must have fallen upon them, and
have been so much clear loss upon the balance of their accounts. The
project of replenishing their coffers in this manner may be compared to
that of a man who had a water-pond from which a stream was continually
running out, and into which no stream was continually running, but who
proposed to keep it always equally full by employing a number of people
to go continually with buckets to a well at some miles distance in order
 to bring water to replenish it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_956">But though this operation had proved, not only practicable, but<span class="type-margin"><span>and even if profitable would have been hurtful to the country.</span></span>
 profitable to the bank as a mercantile company; yet the country could
have derived no benefit from it; but, on the contrary, must have <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>300<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 suffered a very considerable loss by it. This operation could not
augment in the smallest degree the quantity of money to be lent. It
could only have erected this bank into a sort of general loan office for
 the whole country. Those who wanted to borrow, must have applied to
this bank, instead of applying to the private persons who had lent it
their money. But a bank which lends money, perhaps, to five hundred
different people, the greater part of whom its directors can know very
little about, is not likely to be more judicious in the choice of its
debtors, than a private person who lends out his money among a few
people whom he knows, and in whose sober and frugal conduct he thinks he
 has good reason to confide. The debtors of such a bank, as that whose
conduct I have been giving some account of, were likely, the greater
part of them, to be chimerical projectors, the drawers and re-drawers of
 circulating bills of exchange, who would employ the money in
extravagant undertakings, which, with all the assistance that could be
given them, they would probably never be able to complete, and which, if
 they should be completed, would never repay the expence which they had
really cost, would never afford a fund capable of maintaining a quantity
 of labour equal to that which had been employed about them. The sober
and frugal debtors of private persons, on the contrary, would be more
likely to employ the money borrowed in sober undertakings which were
proportioned to their capitals, and which, though they might have less
of the grand and the marvellous, would have more of the solid and the
profitable, which would repay with a large profit whatever had been laid
 out upon them, and which would thus afford a fund capable of
maintaining a much greater quantity of labour than that which had been
employed about them. The success of this operation, therefore, without
increasing in the smallest degree the capital of the country, would only
 have transferred a great part of it from prudent and profitable, to
imprudent and unprofitable undertakings.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_957"><span class="type-margin"><span>Law’s scheme has been sufficiently explained by Du Verney and Du Tot</span></span>That
 the industry of Scotland languished for want of money to employ it, was
 the opinion of the famous Mr. Law. By establishing a bank of a
particular kind, which he seems to have imagined might issue paper to
the amount of the whole value of all the lands in the country, he
proposed to remedy this want of money. The parliament of Scotland, when
he first proposed his project, did not think proper to adopt it.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt693" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt693_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> It was afterwards adopted, with some variations, by the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>301<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 duke of Orleans, at that time regent of France. The idea of the
possibility of multiplying paper money to almost any extent, was the
real foundation of what is called the Mississippi scheme, the most
extravagant project both of banking and stock-jobbing that, perhaps, the
 world ever saw. The different operations of this scheme are explained
so fully, so clearly, and with so much order and distinctness, by Mr. Du
 Verney, in his Examination of the Political Reflections upon Commerce
and Finances of Mr. Du Tot,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt694" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt694_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> that I shall not give any account of them.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt695" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt695_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 The principles upon which it was founded are explained by Mr. Law
himself, in a discourse concerning money and trade, which he published
in Scotland when he first proposed his project.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt696" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt696_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 The splendid, but visionary ideas which are set forth in that and some
other works upon the same principles, still continue to make an
impression upon many people, and have, perhaps, in part, contributed to
that excess of banking, which has of late been complained of both in
Scotland and in other places.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_958">The bank of England is the greatest bank of circulation in Europe.<span class="type-margin"><span>The bank of England was established in 1694,</span></span>
 It was incorporated, in pursuance of an act of parliament, by a charter
 under the great seal, dated the 27th of July, 1694. It at that time
advanced to government the sum of one million two hundred thousand
pounds, for an annuity of one hundred thousand pounds: or for 96,000 <span class="ital">l.</span> a year interest, at the rate of eight per cent., and 4,000 <span class="ital">l.</span>
 a year for the expence of management. The credit of the new government,
 established by the Revolution, we may believe, must have been very low,
 when it was obliged to borrow at so high an interest.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_959">In 1697 the bank was allowed to enlarge its capital stock by an<span class="type-margin"><span>enlarged its stock in 1697</span></span> ingraftment of 1,001,171 <span class="ital">l.</span> 10 <span class="ital">s.</span> Its whole capital stock, therefore, amounted at this time to 2,201,171 <span class="ital">l.</span> 10 <span class="ital">s.</span>

 In 1696, tallies had been at forty, and fifty, and sixty per cent.
discount, and bank notes at twenty per cent.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt697" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt697_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 During the great recoinage of the silver, which was going on at this
time, the bank had thought proper to discontinue the payment of its
notes, which necessarily occasioned their discredit.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>302<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_960"><span class="type-margin"><span>in 1708,</span></span>In pursuance of the 7th Anne, c. vii. the bank advanced and paid into the exchequer, the sum of 400,000 <span class="ital">l.;</span> making in all the sum of 1,600,000 <span class="ital">l.</span> which it had advanced upon its original annuity of 96,000 <span class="ital">l.</span> interest and 4,000 <span class="ital">l.</span>
 for expence of management. In 1708, therefore, the credit of government
 was as good as that of private persons, since it could borrow at six
per cent. interest, the common legal and market rate of those times. In
pursuance of the same act, the bank cancelled exchequer bills to the
amount of 1,775,027 <span class="ital">l.</span> 17 <span class="ital">s.</span> 10½ <span class="ital">d.</span>
 at six per cent. interest, and was at the same time allowed to take in
subscriptions for doubling its capital. In 1708, therefore, the capital
of the bank amounted to 4,402,343 <span class="ital">l.;</span> and it had advanced to government the sum of 3,375,027 <span class="ital">l.</span> 17<span class="ital">s.</span> 10½ <span class="ital">d.</span></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_961"><span class="type-margin"><span>in 1709 and 1710,</span></span>By a call of fifteen per cent. in 1709, there was paid in and made stock 656,204 <span class="ital">l.</span> 1 <span class="ital">s.</span> 9 d.; and by another of ten per cent. in 1710, 501,448 <span class="ital">l.</span> 12 <span class="ital">s.</span> 11 <span class="ital">d.</span> In consequence of those two calls, therefore, the bank capital amounted to 5,559,995 <span class="ital">l.</span> 14 <span class="ital">s.</span> 8 <span class="ital">d.</span></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_962"><span class="type-margin"><span>in 1717, and later.</span></span>In
 pursuance of the 3d George I. c. 8. the bank delivered up two millions
of exchequer bills to be cancelled. It had at this time, therefore,
advanced to government 5,375,027 <span class="ital">l.</span> 17 <span class="ital">s.</span> 10 <span class="ital">d.</span><a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt698" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt698_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> In pursuance of the 8th George I. c. 21. the bank purchased of the South Sea Company, stock to the amount of 4,000,000 <span class="ital">l.:</span>
 and in 1722, in consequence of the subscriptions which it had taken in
for enabling it to make this purchase, its capital stock was increased
by 3,400,000 <span class="ital">l.</span> At this time, therefore, the bank had advanced to the public 9,375,027 <span class="ital">l.</span> 17 <span class="ital">s.</span> 10½<span class="ital">d.;</span> and its capital stock amounted only to 8,959,995 <span class="ital">l.</span> 14 <span class="ital">s.</span> 8 <span class="ital">d.</span>
 It was upon this occasion that the sum which the bank had advanced to
the public, and for which it received interest, began first to exceed
its capital stock, or the sum for which it paid a dividend to the
proprietors of bank stock; or, in other words, that the bank began to
have an undivided capital, over and above its divided one. It has
continued to have an undivided capital of the same kind ever since. In
1746, the bank had, upon different occasions, advanced to the public
11,686,800 <span class="ital">l.</span> and its divided capital had been raised by different calls and subscriptions to 10,780,000 <span class="ital">l.</span><a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt699" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt699_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 The state of those two sums has continued to be the same ever since. In
 pursuance of the 4th of George III. c. 25. the bank agreed to pay to
government for the renewal of its charter 110,000 <span class="ital">l.</span> without interest or repayment. This sum, therefore, did not increase either of those two other sums.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>303<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_963">The dividend of the bank has varied according to the variations in<span class="type-margin"><span>The
 rate of interest received by it from the public has been reduced from 8

 the rate of the interest which it has, at different times, received for
 the money it had advanced to the public, as well as according to other
circumstances. This rate of interest has gradually been reduced from
eight to three per cent. For some years past the bank dividend has been
at five and a half per cent.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_964">The stability of the bank of England is equal to that of the British<span class="type-margin"><span>It acts as a great engine of state.</span></span>
 government. All that it has advanced to the public must be lost before
its creditors can sustain any loss. No other banking company in England
can be established by act of parliament, or can consist of more than six
 members. It acts, not only as an ordinary bank, but as a great engine
of state. It receives and pays the greater part of the annuities which
are due to the creditors of the public, it circulates exchequer bills,
and it advances to government the annual amount of the land and malt
taxes, which are frequently not paid up till some years thereafter. In
those different operations, its duty to the public may sometimes have
obliged it, without any fault of its directors, to overstock the
circulation with paper money. It likewise discounts merchants bills, and
 has, upon several different occasions, supported the credit of the
principal houses, not only of England, but of Hamburgh and Holland. Upon
 one occasion, in 1763, it is said to have advanced for this purpose, in
 one week, about 1,600,000 <span class="ital">l.;</span> a great part of
 it in bullion. I do not, however, pretend to warrant either the
greatness of the sum, or the shortness of the time. Upon other
occasions, this great company has been reduced to the necessity of
paying in sixpences.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt700" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt700_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_965">It is not by augmenting the capital of the country, but by rendering<span class="type-margin"><span>The operations of banking turn dead stock into productive capital,</span></span>
 a greater part of that capital active and productive than would
otherwise be so, that the most judicious operations of banking can
increase the industry of the country. That part of his capital which a
dealer is obliged to keep by him unemployed, and in ready money for
answering occasional demands, is so much dead stock, which, so long as
it remains in this situation, produces nothing either to him or to his
country. The judicious operations of banking enable him to convert this
dead stock into active and productive stock; into materials to work
upon, into tools to work with, and into provisions and subsistence to
work for; into stock which produces something both to himself<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt701" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt701_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> and to his country. The gold and silver money which circulates in any <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>304<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 country, and by means of which the produce of its land and labour is
annually circulated and distributed to the proper consumers, is, in the
same manner as the ready money of the dealer, all dead stock. It is a
very valuable part of the capital of the country, which produces nothing
 to the country. The judicious operations of banking, by substituting
paper in the room of a great part of this gold and silver, enables the
country to convert a great part of this dead stock into active and
productive stock; into stock which produces something to the country.
The gold and silver money which circulates in any country may very
properly be compared to a highway, which, while it circulates and
carries to market all the grass and corn of the country, produces itself
 not a single pile of either. The judicious operations of banking, by
providing, if I may be allowed so violent a metaphor, a sort of
waggon-way through the air; enable the country to convert, as it were, a
 great part of its highways into good pastures and corn-fields, and
thereby to increase very considerably the annual produce of<span class="type-margin"><span>but make its commerce and industry somewhat less secure</span></span>
 its land and labour. The commerce and industry of the country, however,
 it must be acknowledged, though they may be somewhat augmented, cannot
be altogether so secure, when they are thus, as it were, suspended upon
the Dædalian wings of paper money, as when they travel about upon the
solid ground of gold and silver. Over and above the accidents to which
they are exposed from the unskilfulness of the conductors of this paper
money, they are liable to several others, from which no prudence or
skill of those conductors can guard them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_966"><span class="type-margin"><span>Precautions should be taken to prevent the greater part of the circulation being filled with paper.</span></span>An
 unsuccessful war, for example, in which the enemy got possession of the
 capital, and consequently of that treasure which supported the credit
of the paper money, would occasion a much greater confusion in a country
 where the whole circulation was carried on by paper, than in one where
the greater part of it was carried on by gold and silver. The usual
instrument of commerce having lost its value, no exchanges could be made
 but either by barter or upon credit. All taxes having been usually paid
 in paper money, the prince would not have wherewithal either to pay his
 troops, or to furnish his magazines; and the state of the country would
 be much more irretrievable than if the greater part of its circulation
had consisted in gold and silver. A prince, anxious to maintain his
dominions at all times in the state in which he can most easily defend
them, ought, upon this account, to guard, not only against that
excessive multiplication of paper money which ruins the very banks which
 issue it; but even against that multiplication of it, which enables
them to fill the greater part of the circulation of the country with it.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>305<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_967">The circulation of every country may be considered as divided into<span class="type-margin"><span>Circulation may be divided into that between dealers and that between dealers and consumers.</span></span>
 two different branches; the circulation of the dealers with one
another, and the circulation between the dealers and the consumers.
Though the same pieces of money, whether paper or metal, may be employed
 sometimes in the one circulation and sometimes in the other; yet as
both are constantly going on at the same time, each requires a certain
stock of money of one kind or another, to carry it on. The value of the
goods circulated between the different dealers, never can exceed the
value of those circulated between the dealers and the consumers;
whatever is bought by the dealers, being ultimately destined to be sold
to the consumers. The circulation between the dealers, as it is carried
on by wholesale, requires generally a pretty large sum for every
particular transaction. That between the dealers and the consumers, on
the contrary, as it is generally carried on by retail, frequently
requires but very small ones, a shilling, or even a halfpenny, being
often sufficient. But small sums circulate much faster than large ones. A
 shilling changes masters more frequently than a guinea, and a halfpenny
 more frequently than a shilling Though the annual purchases of all the
consumers, therefore, are at least equal in value to those of all the
dealers, they can generally be transacted with a much smaller quantity
of money; the same pieces, by a more rapid circulation, serving as the
instrument of many more purchases of the one kind than of the other.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_968">Paper money may be so regulated, as either to confine itself very<span class="type-margin"><span>The circulation of paper may be confined to the former by not allowing notes for small sums.</span></span>
 much to the circulation between the different dealers, or to extend
itself likewise to a great part of that between the dealers and the
consumers. Where no bank notes are circulated under ten pounds value, as
 in London,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt702" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt702_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 paper money confines itself very much to the circulation between the
dealers. When a ten pound bank note comes into the hands of a consumer,
he is generally obliged to change it at the first shop where he has
occasion to purchase five shillings worth of goods; so that it often
returns into the hands of a dealer, before the consumer has spent the
fortieth part of the money. Where bank notes are issued for so small
sums as twenty shillings, as in Scotland, paper money extends itself to a
 considerable part of the circulation between dealers and consumers.
Before the act of parliament, which put a stop to the circulation of ten
 and five shilling notes,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt703" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt703_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> it filled a still greater part of that circulation. In the currencies of North America, paper was <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>306<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 commonly issued for so small a sum as a shilling, and filled almost the
 whole of that circulation. In some paper currencies of Yorkshire, it
was issued even for so small a sum as a sixpence.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_969"><span class="type-margin"><span>The issue of such notes enables mean people to become bankers.</span></span>Where
 the issuing of bank notes for such very small sums is allowed and
commonly practised, many mean people are both enabled and encouraged to
become bankers. A person whose promissory note for five pounds, or even
for twenty shillings, would be rejected by every body, will get it to be
 received without scruple when it is issued for so small a sum as a
sixpence. But the frequent bankruptcies to which such beggarly bankers
must be liable, may occasion a very considerable inconveniency, and
sometimes even a very great calamity, to many poor people who had
received their notes in payment.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_970"><span class="type-margin"><span>None for less than £5 should be issued.</span></span>It
 were better, perhaps, that no bank notes were issued in any part of the
 kingdom for a smaller sum than five pounds. Paper money would then,
probably, confine itself, in every part of the kingdom, to the
circulation between the different dealers, as much as it does at present
 in London, where no bank notes are issued under ten pounds value; five
pounds being, in most parts of the kingdom, a sum which, though it will
purchase, perhaps, little more than half the quantity of goods, is as
much considered, and is as seldom spent all at once, as ten pounds are
amidst the profuse expence of London.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_971"><span class="type-margin"><span>This would secure the circulation of plenty of gold and silver,</span></span>Where
 paper money, it is to be observed, is pretty much confined to the
circulation between dealers and dealers, as at London, there is always
plenty of gold and silver. Where it extends itself to a considerable
part of the circulation between dealers and consumers, as in Scotland,
and still more in North America, it banishes gold and silver almost
entirely from the country; almost all the ordinary transactions of its
interior commerce being thus carried on by paper. The suppression of ten
 and five shilling bank notes, somewhat relieved the scarcity of gold
and silver in Scotland; and the suppression of twenty shilling notes,
would probably relieve it still more. Those metals are said to have
become more abundant in America, since the suppression of some of their
paper currencies. They are said, likewise, to have been more abundant
before the institution of those currencies.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_972"><span class="type-margin"><span>and would not prevent banks from giving sufficient assistance to traders.</span></span>Though
 paper money should be pretty much confined to the circulation between
dealers and dealers, yet banks and bankers might still be able to give
nearly the same assistance to the industry and commerce of the country,
as they had done when paper money filled almost the whole circulation.
The ready money which a dealer is obliged to keep by him, for answering
occasional demands, is destined altogether for the circulation between
himself and other dealers, of whom he buys <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>307<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 goods. He has no occasion to keep any by him for the circulation
between himself and the consumers, who are his customers, and who bring
ready money to him, instead of taking any from him. Though no paper
money, therefore, was allowed to be issued, but for such sums as would
confine it pretty much to the circulation between dealers and dealers;
yet, partly by discounting real bills of exchange, and partly by lending
 upon cash accounts, banks and bankers might still be able to relieve
the greater part of those dealers from the necessity of keeping any
considerable part of their stock by them, unemployed and in ready money,
 for answering occasional demands. They might still be able to give the
utmost assistance which banks and bankers can, with propriety, give to
traders of every kind.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_973">To restrain private people, it may be said, from receiving in payment<span class="type-margin"><span>A law against small notes would be a violation of natural liberty necessary for the security of the society.</span></span>
 the promissory notes of a banker, for any sum whether great or small,
when they themselves are willing to receive them; or, to restrain a
banker from issuing such notes, when all his neighbours are willing to
accept of them, is a manifest violation of that natural liberty which it
 is the proper business of law, not to infringe, but to support. Such
regulations may, no doubt, be considered as in some respect a violation
of natural liberty. But those exertions of the natural liberty of a few
individuals, which might endanger the security of the whole society,
are, and ought to be, restrained by the laws of all governments; of the
most free, as well as of the most despotical. The obligation of building
 party walls, in order to prevent the communication of fire, is a
violation of natural liberty, exactly of the same kind with the
regulations of the banking trade which are here proposed.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_974">A paper money consisting in bank notes, issued by people of undoubted<span class="type-margin"><span>Paper money payable on demand is equal to gold and silver,</span></span>
 credit, payable upon demand without any condition, and in fact always
readily paid as soon as presented, is, in every respect, equal in value
to gold and silver money; since gold and silver money can at any time be
 had for it. Whatever is either bought or sold for such paper, must
necessarily be bought or sold as cheap as it could have been for gold
and silver.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_975">The increase of paper money, it has been said, by augmenting the<span class="type-margin"><span>and does not raise prices;</span></span>
 quantity, and consequently diminishing the value of the whole currency,
 necessarily augments the money price of commodities. But as the
quantity of gold and silver, which is taken from the currency, is always
 equal to the quantity of paper which is added to it, paper money does
not necessarily increase the quantity of the whole currency. From the
beginning of the last century to the present time, provisions never were
 cheaper in Scotland than in 1759, though, from the circulation of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>308<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 ten and five shilling bank notes, there was then more paper money in
the country than at present. The proportion between the price of
provisions in Scotland and that in England, is the same now as before
the great multiplication of banking companies in Scotland. Corn is, upon
 most occasions, fully as cheap in England as in France; though there is
 a great deal of paper money in England, and scarce any in France. In
1751 and in 1752, when Mr. Hume published his Political Discourses,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt704" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt704_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 and soon after the great multiplication of paper money in Scotland,
there was a very sensible rise in the price of provisions, owing,
probably, to the badness of the seasons, and not to the multiplication
of paper money.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_976"><span class="type-margin"><span>but paper not repayable on demand would fall below gold and silver,</span></span>It
 would be otherwise, indeed, with a paper money consisting in promissory
 notes, of which the immediate payment depended, in any respect, either
upon the good will of those who issued them; or upon a condition which
the holder of the notes might not always have it in his power to fulfil;
 or of which the payment was not exigible till after a certain number of
 years, and which in the mean time bore no interest. Such a paper money
would, no doubt, fall more or less below the value of gold and silver,
according as the difficulty or uncertainty of obtaining immediate
payment was supposed to be greater or less; or according to the greater
or less distance of time at which payment was exigible.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_977"><span class="type-margin"><span>as happened in Scotland during the prevalence of the Optional Clause,</span></span>Some
 years ago the different banking companies of Scotland were in the
practice of inserting into their bank notes, what they called an
Optional Clause, by which they promised payment to the bearer, either as
 soon as the note should be presented, or, in the option of the
directors, six months after such presentment, together with the legal
interest for the said six months. The directors of some of those banks
sometimes took advantage of this optional clause, and sometimes
threatened those who demanded gold and silver in exchange for a
considerable number of their notes, that they would take advantage of
it, unless such demanders would content themselves with a part of what
they demanded. The promissory notes of those banking companies
constituted at that time the far greater part of the currency of
Scotland, which this uncertainty of payment necessarily degraded below
the value of gold and silver money. During the continuance of this abuse
 (which prevailed chiefly in 1762, 1763, and 1764), while the exchange
between London and Carlisle was at par, that between London and Dumfries
 would sometimes be four per cent. against Dumfries, though this town <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>309<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 is not thirty miles distant from Carlisle. But at Carlisle, bills were
paid in gold and silver; whereas at Dumfries they were paid in Scotch
bank notes, and the uncertainty of getting those bank notes exchanged
for gold and silver coin had thus degraded them four per cent. below the
 value of that coin. The same act of parliament which suppressed ten and
 five shilling bank notes, suppressed likewise this optional clause,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt705" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt705_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 and thereby restored the exchange between England and Scotland to its
natural rate, or to what the course of trade and remittances might
happen to make it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_978">In the paper currencies of Yorkshire, the payment of so small a sum<span class="type-margin"><span>and must have happened in regard to the Yorkshire currencies when small sums were repayable in guineas.</span></span>
 as a sixpence sometimes depended upon the condition that the holder of
the note should bring the change of a guinea to the person who issued
it; a condition, which the holders of such notes might frequently find
it very difficult to fulfil, and which must have degraded this currency
below the value of gold and silver money. An act of parliament,
accordingly, declared all such clauses unlawful, and suppressed, in the
same manner as in Scotland, all promissory notes, payable to the bearer,
 under twenty shillings value.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt706" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt706_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_979">The paper currencies of North America consisted, not in bank notes<span class="type-margin"><span>The North American paper currencies consisted of government notes repayable at a distant date,</span></span>
 payable to the bearer on demand, but in a government paper, of which
the payment was not exigible till several years after it was issued: And
 though the colony governments paid no interest to the holders of this
paper, they declared it to be, and in fact rendered it, a legal tender
of payment for the full value for which it was issued. But allowing the
colony security to be perfectly good, a hundred pounds payable fifteen
years hence, for example, in a country where interest is at six per
cent. is worth little more than forty pounds ready money. To oblige a
creditor, therefore, to accept of this as full payment for a debt of a
hundred pounds actually paid down in ready money, was an act of such
violent injustice, as has scarce, perhaps, been attempted by the
government of any other country which pretended to be free. It bears the
 evident marks of having originally been, what the honest and downright
Doctor Douglas assures us it was, a scheme of fraudulent debtors to
cheat their creditors.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt707" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt707_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 The government of Pensylvania, indeed, pretended, upon their first
emission of paper money, in 1722, to render their paper of equal value
with gold and silver, by enacting penalties against all those <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>310<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 who made any difference in the price of their goods when they sold them
 for a colony paper, and when they sold them for gold and silver; a
regulation equally tyrannical, but much less effectual than that which
it was meant to support. A positive law may render a shilling a legal
tender for a guinea; because it may direct the courts of justice to
discharge the debtor who has made that tender. But no positive law can
oblige a person who sells goods, and who is at liberty to sell or not to
 sell, as he pleases, to accept of a shilling as equivalent to a guinea
in<span class="type-margin"><span>and depreciated the currency to a great degree.</span></span>
 the price of them. Notwithstanding any regulation of this kind, it
appeared by the course of exchange with Great Britain, that a hundred
pounds sterling was occasionally considered as equivalent, in some of
the colonies, to a hundred and thirty pounds, and in others to so great a
 sum as eleven hundred pounds currency; this difference in the value
arising from the difference in the quantity of paper emitted in the
different colonies, and in the distance and probability of the term of
its final discharge and redemption.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_980"><span class="type-margin"><span>They were therefore justly prohibited.</span></span>No
 law, therefore, could be more equitable than the act of parliament, so
unjustly complained of in the colonies, which declared that no paper
currency to be emitted there in time coming, should be a legal tender of
 payment.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt708" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt708_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_981"><span class="type-margin"><span>Pennsylvania was moderate in its issues, and its currency never went below the real par.</span></span>Pensylvania
 was always more moderate in its emissions of paper money than any other
 of our colonies. Its paper currency accordingly is said never to have
sunk below the value of the gold and silver which was current in the
colony before the first emission of its paper money. Before that
emission, the colony had raised the denomination of its coin, and had,
by act of assembly, ordered five shillings sterling to pass in the
colony for six and three-pence, and afterwards for six and eight-pence. A
 pound colony currency, therefore, even when that currency was gold and
silver, was more than thirty per cent. below the value of a pound
sterling, and when that currency was turned into paper, it was seldom
much more than thirty per cent. below that value. The pretence for
raising the denomination of the coin, was to prevent the exportation of
gold and silver, by making equal quantities of those metals pass for
greater sums in the colony than they did in the mother country. It was
found, however, that the price of all goods from the mother country rose
 exactly in proportion as they raised the denomination of their coin, so
 that their gold and silver were exported as fast as ever.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_982"><span class="type-margin"><span>The colonial paper was somewhat supported by being received in payment of taxes.</span></span>The
 paper of each colony being received in the payment of the provincial
taxes, for the full value for which it had been issued, it <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>311<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 necessarily derived from this use some additional value, over and above
 what it would have had, from the real or supposed distance of the term
of its final discharge and redemption. This additional value was greater
 or less, according as the quantity of paper issued was more or less
above what could be employed in the payment of the taxes of the
particular colony which issued it. It was in all the colonies very much
above what could be employed in this manner.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_983">A prince, who should enact that a certain proportion of his taxes<span class="type-margin"><span>A
 requirement that certain taxes should be paid in particular paper money
 might give that paper a certain value even if it was irredeemable.</span></span>
 should be paid in a paper money of a certain kind, might thereby give a
 certain value to this paper money; even though the term of its final
discharge and redemption should depend altogether upon the will of the
prince. If the bank which issued this paper was careful to keep the
quantity of it always somewhat below what could easily be employed in
this manner, the demand for it might be such as to make it even bear a
premium, or sell for somewhat more in the market than the quantity of
gold or silver currency for which it was issued. Some people account in
this manner for what is called the Agio of the bank of Amsterdam, or for
 the superiority of bank money over current money; though this bank
money, as they pretend, cannot be taken out of the bank at the will of
the owner. The greater part of foreign bills of exchange must be paid in
 bank money, that is, by a transfer in the books of the bank; and the
directors of the bank, they allege, are careful to keep the whole
quantity of bank money always below what this use occasions a demand
for. It is upon this account, they say, that bank money sells for a
premium, or bears an agio of four or five per cent. above the same
nominal sum of the gold and silver currency of the country. This account
 of the bank of Amsterdam, however, it will appear hereafter,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt709" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt709_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> is in a great measure chimerical.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt710" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt710_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_984">A paper currency which falls below the value of gold and silver<span class="type-margin"><span>A paper currency depreciated below the value of the coin does not sink the value of gold and silver.</span></span> coin, does not thereby sink the value of those metals, or occasion equal quantities of them<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt711" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt711_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 to exchange for a smaller quantity of goods of any other kind. The
proportion between the value of gold and silver and that of goods of any
 other kind, depends in all cases, not upon the nature or quantity of
any particular paper money, which may be current in any particular
country, but upon the richness or poverty of the mines, which happen at
any particular time to supply the great market <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>312<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of the commercial world with those metals. It depends upon the
proportion between the quantity of labour which is necessary in order to
 bring a certain quantity of gold and silver to market, and that which
is necessary in order to bring thither a certain quantity of any other
sort of goods.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_985"><span class="type-margin"><span>The only
restrictions on banking which are necessary are the prohibition of small
 bank notes and the requirement that all notes shall be repaid on
demand.</span></span>If bankers are restrained from issuing any
circulating bank notes, or notes payable to the bearer, for less than a
certain sum; and if they are subjected to the obligation of an immediate
 and unconditional payment of such bank notes as soon as presented,
their trade may, with safety to the public, be rendered in all other
respects perfectly free. The late multiplication of banking companies in
 both parts of the united kingdom, an event by which many people have
been much alarmed, instead of diminishing, increases the security of the
 public. It obliges all of them to be more circumspect in their conduct,
 and, by not extending their currency beyond its due proportion to their
 cash, to guard themselves against those malicious runs, which the
rivalship of so many competitors is always ready to bring upon them. It
restrains the circulation of each particular company within a narrower
circle, and reduces their circulating notes to a smaller number. By
dividing the whole circulation into a greater number of parts, the
failure of any one company, an accident which, in the course of things,
must sometimes happen, becomes of less consequence to the public. This
free competition too obliges all bankers to be more liberal in their
dealings with their customers, lest their rivals should carry them away.
 In general, if any branch of trade, or any division of labour, be
advantageous to the public, the freer and more general the competition,
it will always be the more so.</p>

<h2 id="lf0206-01_label_771">CHAPTER III: OF THE ACCUMULATION OF CAPITAL, OR OF PRODUCTIVE AND UNPRODUCTIVE LABOUR</h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-01_986">THERE is one sort of labour which adds to the value of the subject<span class="type-margin"><span>There are two sorts of labour, productive and unproductive</span></span>
 upon which it is bestowed: there is another which has no such effect.
The former, as it produces a value, may be called productive; the
latter, unproductive<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt712" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt712_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 labour. Thus the labour of a manufacturer adds, generally, to the value
 of the materials which he works upon, that of his own maintenance, and
of his master’s profit. The labour of a menial servant, on the contrary,
 adds to the value of nothing. Though the manufacturer has his wages
advanced to him by his master, he, in reality, costs him no expence, the
 value of those wages being generally restored, together with a profit,
in the improved value of the subject upon which his labour is bestowed.
But the maintenance of a menial servant never is restored. A man grows
rich by employing a multitude of manufacturers: he grows poor, by
maintaining a multitude of menial servants.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt713" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt713_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 The labour of the latter, however, has its value, and deserves its
reward as well as that of the former. But the labour of the manufacturer
 fixes and realizes itself in some particular subject or vendible
commodity, which lasts for some time at least after that labour is past.
 It is, as it were, a certain quantity of labour stocked and stored up
to be employed, if necessary, upon some other occasion. That subject, or
 what is the same thing, the price of that subject, can afterwards, if
necessary, put into motion a quantity of labour equal to that which had
originally produced it. The labour of the menial <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>314<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 servant, on the contrary, does not fix or realize itself in any
particular subject or vendible commodity. His services generally perish
in the very instant of their performance, and seldom leave any trace or
value behind them, for which an equal quantity of service could
afterwards be procured.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_987"><span class="type-margin"><span>Many kinds of labour besides menial service are unproductive.</span></span>The
 labour of some of the most respectable orders in the society is, like
that of menial servants, unproductive of any value, and does not fix or
realize itself in any permanent subject, or vendible commodity, which
endures after that labour is past, and for which an equal quantity of
labour could afterwards be procured. The sovereign, for example, with
all the officers both of justice and war who serve under him, the whole
army and navy, are unproductive labourers. They are the servants of the
public, and are maintained by a part of the annual produce of the
industry of other people. Their service, how honourable, how useful,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt714" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt714_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 or how necessary soever, produces nothing for which an equal quantity
of service can afterwards be procured. The protection, security, and
defence of the commonwealth, the effect of their labour this year, will
not purchase its protection, security, and defence for the year to come.
 In the same class must be ranked, some both of the gravest and most
important, and some of the most frivolous professions: churchmen,
lawyers, physicians, men of letters of all kinds; players, buffoons,
musicians, opera-singers, opera-dancers, &amp;c. The labour of the
meanest of these has a certain value, regulated by the very same
principles which regulate that of every other sort of labour; and that
of the noblest and most useful, produces nothing which could afterwards
purchase or procure an equal quantity of labour. Like the declamation of
 the actor, the harangue of the orator, or the tune of the musician, the
 work of all of them perishes in the very instant of its production.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_988"><span class="type-margin"><span>The proportion of the produce employed in maintaining productive hands determines the next year’s produce.</span></span>Both
 productive and unproductive labourers, and those who do not labour at
all, are all equally maintained by the annual produce of the land and
labour of the country. This produce, how great soever, can never be
infinite, but must have certain limits. According, therefore, as a
smaller or greater proportion of it is in any one year employed in
maintaining unproductive hands, the more in the one case and the less in
 the other will remain for the productive, and the next year’s produce
will be greater or smaller accordingly; the whole annual produce, if we
except the spontaneous productions of the earth, being the effect of
productive labour.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>315<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_989">Though the whole annual produce of the land and labour of every<span class="type-margin"><span>Part of the produce replaces capital, part constitutes profit and rent.</span></span>
 country, is, no doubt, ultimately destined for supplying the
consumption of its inhabitants, and for procuring a revenue to them; yet
 when it first comes either from the ground, or from the hands of the
productive labourers, it naturally divides itself into two parts. One of
 them, and frequently the largest, is, in the first place, destined for
replacing a capital, or for renewing the provisions, materials, and
finished work, which had been withdrawn from a capital; the other for
constituting a revenue either to the owner of this capital, as the
profit of his stock; or to some other person, as the rent of his land.
Thus, of the produce of land, one part replaces the capital of the
farmer; the other pays his profit and the rent of the landlord; and thus
 constitutes a revenue both to the owner of this capital, as the profits
 of his stock; and to some other person, as the rent of his land. Of the
 produce of a great manufactory, in the same manner, one part, and that
always the largest, replaces the capital of the undertaker of the work;
the other pays his profit, and thus constitutes a revenue to the owner
of this capital.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt715" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt715_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_990">That part of the annual produce of the land and labour of any<span class="type-margin"><span>That which replaces capital employs none but productive hands,</span></span>
 country which replaces a capital, never is immediately employed to
maintain any but productive hands. It pays the wages of productive
labour only. That which is immediately destined for constituting a
revenue either as profit or as rent, may maintain indifferently either
productive or unproductive hands.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_991">Whatever part of his stock a man employs as a
capital, he always expects is to be replaced to him with a profit. He
employs it, therefore, in maintaining productive hands only; and after
having served in the function of a capital to him, it constitutes a
revenue to them. Whenever he employs any part of it in maintaining
unproductive hands of any kind, that part is, from that moment,
withdrawn from his capital, and placed in his stock reserved for
immediate consumption.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_992">Unproductive labourers, and those who do not labour at all, are all<span class="type-margin"><span>while unproductive hands and those who do not labour are supported by revenue.</span></span>
 maintained by revenue; either, first, by that part of the annual
produce which is originally destined for constituting a revenue to some
particular persons, either as the rent of land or as the profits of
stock; or, secondly, by that part which, though originally destined for
replacing a capital and for maintaining productive labourers only, yet
when it comes into their hands, whatever part of it is over and above
their <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>316<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 necessary subsistence, may be employed in maintaining indifferently
either productive or unproductive hands. Thus, not only the great
landlord or the rich merchant, but even the common workman, if his wages
 are considerable, may maintain a menial servant; or he may sometimes go
 to a play or a puppet-show, and so contribute his share towards
maintaining one set of unproductive labourers; or he may pay some taxes,
 and thus help to maintain another set, more honourable and useful,
indeed, but equally unproductive. No part of the annual produce,
however, which had been originally destined to replace a capital, is
ever directed towards maintaining unproductive hands, till after it has
put into motion its full complement of productive labour, or all that it
 could put into motion in the way in which it was employed. The workman
must have earned his wages by work done, before he can employ any part
of them in this manner. That part too is generally but a small one. It
is his spare revenue only, of which productive labourers have seldom a
great deal. They generally have some, however; and in the payment of
taxes the greatness of their number may compensate, in some measure, the
 smallness of their contribution. The rent of land and the profits of
stock are every-where, therefore, the principal sources from which
unproductive hands derive their subsistence. These are the two sorts of
revenue of which the owners have generally most to spare. They might
both maintain indifferently either productive or unproductive hands.
They seem, however, to have some predilection for the latter. The
expence of a great lord feeds generally more idle than industrious
people. The rich merchant, though with his capital he maintains
industrious people only, yet by his expence, that is, by the employment
of his revenue, he feeds commonly the very same sort as the great lord.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_993"><span class="type-margin"><span>So the
proportion of productive hands depends on the proportion between profit
with rent and the part of produce which replaces capital.</span></span>The
 proportion, therefore, between the productive and unproductive hands,
depends very much in every country upon the proportion between that part
 of the annual produce, which, as soon as it comes either from the
ground or from the hands of the productive labourers, is destined for
replacing a capital, and that which is destined for constituting a
revenue, either as rent, or as profit. This proportion is very different
 in rich from what it is in poor countries.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_994">Thus, at present, in the opulent countries of
Europe, a very large, frequently the largest portion of the produce of
the land, is destined for replacing the capital of the rich and
independent farmer; the other for paying his profits, and the rent of
the landlord.<span class="type-margin"><span>Rent anciently formed a larger proportion of the produce of agriculture than now.</span></span>
 But anciently, during the prevalency of the feudal government, a very
small portion of the produce was sufficient to replace the capital
employed in cultivation. <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>317<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 It consisted commonly in a few wretched cattle, maintained altogether
by the spontaneous produce of uncultivated land, and which might,
therefore, be considered as a part of that spontaneous produce. It
generally too belonged to the landlord, and was by him advanced to the
occupiers of the land. All the rest of the produce properly belonged to
him too, either as rent for his land, or as profit upon this paultry
capital. The occupiers of land were generally bondmen, whose persons and
 effects were equally his property. Those who were not bondmen were
tenants at will, and though the rent which they paid was often nominally
 little more than a quit-rent, it really amounted to the whole produce
of the land. Their lord could at all times command their labour in
peace, and their service in war. Though they lived at a distance from
his house, they were equally dependent upon him as his retainers who
lived in it. But the whole produce of the land undoubtedly belongs to
him, who can dispose of the labour and service of all those whom it
maintains. In the present state of Europe, the share of the landlord
seldom exceeds a third, sometimes not a fourth part of the whole produce
 of the land. The rent of land, however, in all the improved parts of
the country, has been tripled and quadrupled since those ancient times;
and this third or fourth part of the annual produce is, it seems, three
or four times greater than the whole had been before. In the progress of
 improvement, rent, though it increases in proportion to the extent,
diminishes in proportion to the produce of the land.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_995">In the opulent countries of Europe, great capitals are at present<span class="type-margin"><span>Profits were anciently a larger share of the produce of manufactures,</span></span>
 employed in trade and manufactures. In the ancient state, the little
trade that was stirring, and the few homely and coarse manufactures that
 were carried on, required but very small capitals. These, however, must
 have yielded very large profits. The rate of interest was no-where less
 than ten per cent. and their profits must have been sufficient to
afford this great interest. At present the rate of interest, in the
improved parts of Europe, is no-where higher than six per cent. and in
some of the most improved it is so low as four, three, and two per cent.
 Though that part of the revenue of the inhabitants which is derived
from the profits of stock is always much greater in rich than in poor
countries, it is because the stock is much greater: in proportion to the
 stock the profits are generally much less.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt716" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt716_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_996">That part of the annual produce, therefore, which, as soon as it comes<span class="type-margin"><span>so the proportion of produce required for replacing capital is greater than it was.</span></span> either from the ground, or from the hands of the productive labourers, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>318<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 is destined for replacing a capital, is not only much greater in rich
than in poor countries, but bears a much greater proportion to that
which is immediately destined for constituting a revenue either as rent
or as profit. The funds destined for the maintenance of productive
labour, are not only much greater in the former than in the latter, but
bear a much greater proportion to those which, though they may be
employed to maintain either productive or unproductive hands, have
generally a predilection for the latter.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_997"><span class="type-margin"><span>The proportion between the funds determines whether the inhabitants of the country shall be industrious or idle.</span></span>The
 proportion between those different funds necessarily determines in
every country the general character of the inhabitants as to industry or
 idleness. We are more industrious than our forefathers; because in the
present times the funds destined for the maintenance of industry, are
much greater in proportion to those which are likely to be employed in
the maintenance of idleness, than they were two or three centuries ago.
Our ancestors were idle for want of a sufficient encouragement to
industry. It is better, says the proverb, to play for nothing, than to
work for nothing. In mercantile and manufacturing towns, where the
inferior ranks of people are chiefly maintained by the employment of
capital, they are in general industrious, sober, and thriving; as in
many English, and in most Dutch towns. In those towns which are
principally supported by the constant or occasional residence of a
court, and in which the inferior ranks of people are chiefly maintained
by the spending of revenue, they are in general idle, dissolute, and
poor; as at Rome, Versailles, Compiegne, and Fontainbleau. If you except
 Rouen and Bourdeaux, there is little trade or industry in any of the
parliament towns of France;<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt717" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt717_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 and the inferior ranks of people, being chiefly maintained by the
expence of the members of the courts of justice, and of those who come
to plead before them, are in general idle and poor. The great trade of
Rouen and Bourdeaux seems to be altogether the effect of their
situation. Rouen is necessarily the entrepôt of almost all the goods
which are brought either from foreign countries, or from the maritime
provinces of France, for the consumption of the great city of Paris.
Bourdeaux is in the same manner the entrepôt of the wines which grow
upon the banks of the Garonne, and of the rivers which run into it, one
of the richest wine countries in the world, and which seems to produce
the wine fittest for exportation, or best suited to the taste of foreign
 nations. Such advantageous situations necessarily attract a great
capital by the great employment which they afford it; and the employment
 of this capital is the cause <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>319<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of the industry of those two cities. In the other parliament towns of
France, very little more capital seems to be employed than what is
necessary for supplying their own consumption; that is, little more than
 the smallest capital which can be employed in them. The same thing may
be said of Paris, Madrid, and Vienna. Of those three cities, Paris is by
 far the most industrious: but Paris itself is the principal market of
all the manufactures established at Paris, and its own consumption is
the principal object of all the trade which it carries on. London,
Lisbon, and Copenhagen, are, perhaps, the only three cities in Europe,
which are both the constant residence of a court, and can at the same
time be considered as trading cities, or as cities which trade not only
for their own consumption, but for that of other cities and countries.
The situation of all the three is extremely advantageous, and naturally
fits them to be the entrepôts of a great part of the goods destined for
the consumption of distant places. In a city where a great revenue is
spent, to employ with advantage a capital for any other purpose than for
 supplying the consumption of that city, is probably more difficult than
 in one in which the inferior ranks of people have no other maintenance
but what they derive from the employment of such a capital. The idleness
 of the greater part of the people who are maintained by the expence of
revenue, corrupts, it is probable, the industry of those who ought to be
 maintained by the employment of capital, and renders it less
advantageous to employ a capital there than in other places. There was
little trade or industry in Edinburgh before the Union. When the Scotch
parliament was no longer to be assembled in it, when it ceased to be the
 necessary residence of the principal nobility and gentry of Scotland,
it became a city of some trade and industry. It still continues,
however, to be the residence of the principal courts of justice in
Scotland, of the boards of customs and excise, &amp;c. A considerable
revenue, therefore, still continues to be spent in it. In trade and
industry it is much inferior to Glasgow, of which the inhabitants are
chiefly maintained by the employment of capital.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt718" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt718_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The inhabitants of a large village, it has sometimes been observed,
after having made considerable progress in manufactures, have become
idle and poor, in consequence of a great lord’s having taken up his
residence in their neighbourhood.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_998">The proportion between capital and revenue, therefore, seems everywhere<span class="type-margin"><span>Increase or diminution of the capital of a country consequently increases or diminishes its annual produce.</span></span> to regulate the proportion between industry and idleness. <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>320<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 Wherever capital predominates, industry prevails: wherever revenue,
idleness. Every increase or diminution of capital, therefore, naturally
tends to increase or diminish the real quantity of industry, the number
of productive hands, and consequently the exchangeable value of the
annual produce of the land and labour of the country, the real wealth
and revenue of all its inhabitants.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_999"><span class="type-margin"><span>Capitals are increased by parsimony or saving.</span></span>Capitals are increased by parsimony, and diminished by prodigality and misconduct.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1000">Whatever a person saves from his revenue he
adds to his capital, and either employs it himself in maintaining an
additional number of productive hands, or enables some other person to
do so, by lending it to him for an interest, that is, for a share of the
 profits. As the capital of an individual can be increased only by what
he saves from his annual revenue or his annual gains, so the capital of a
 society, which is the same with that of all the individuals who compose
 it, can be increased only in the same manner.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1001">Parsimony, and not industry, is the immediate
 cause of the increase of capital. Industry, indeed, provides the
subject which parsimony accumulates. But whatever industry might
acquire, if parsimony did not save and store up, the capital would never
 be the greater.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1002">Parsimony, by increasing the fund which is
destined for the maintenance of productive hands, tends to increase the
number of those hands whose labour adds to the value of the subject upon
 which it is bestowed. It tends therefore to increase the exchangeable
value of the annual produce of the land and labour of the country. It
puts into motion an additional quantity of industry, which gives an
additional value to the annual produce.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1003"><span class="type-margin"><span>What is saved is consumed by productive hands.</span></span>What is annually saved is as regularly consumed as what is annually spent, and nearly in the same time too;<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt719" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt719_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 but it is consumed by a different set of people. That portion of his
revenue which a rich man annually spends, is in most cases consumed by
idle guests, and menial servants, who leave nothing behind them in
return for their consumption. That portion which he annually saves, as
for the sake of the profit it is immediately employed as a capital, is
consumed in the same manner, and nearly in the same time too, but by a
different set of people, by labourers, manufacturers, and artificers,
who re-produce with a profit the value of their annual consumption. His
revenue, we shall suppose, is paid him in money. Had he spent the whole,
 the food, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>321<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 clothing, and lodging, which the whole could have purchased, would have
 been distributed among the former set of people. By saving a part of
it, as that part is for the sake of the profit immediately employed as a
 capital either by himself or by some other person, the food, clothing,
and lodging, which may be purchased with it, are necessarily reserved
for the latter. The consumption is the same, but the consumers are
different.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1004">By what a frugal man annually saves, he not only affords maintenance<span class="type-margin"><span>The frugal man establishes a perpetual fund for the employment of productive hands.</span></span>
 to an additional number of productive hands, for that or the ensuing
year, but, like the founder of a public workhouse, he establishes as it
were a perpetual fund for the maintenance of an equal number in all
times to come. The perpetual allotment and destination of this fund,
indeed, is not always guarded by any positive law, by any trust-right or
 deed of mortmain. It is always guarded, however, by a very powerful
principle, the plain and evident interest of every individual to whom
any share of it shall ever belong. No part of it can ever afterwards be
employed to maintain any but productive hands, without an evident loss
to the person who thus perverts it from its proper destination.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1005">The prodigal perverts it in this manner. By not confining his expence<span class="type-margin"><span>The prodigal perverts such funds to other uses.</span></span>
 within his income, he encroaches upon his capital. Like him who
perverts the revenues of some pious foundation to profane purposes, he
pays the wages of idleness with those funds which the frugality of his
forefathers had, as it were, consecrated to the maintenance of industry.
 By diminishing the funds destined for the employment of productive
labour, he necessarily diminishes, so far as it<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt720" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt720_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 depends upon him, the quantity of that labour which adds a value to the
 subject upon which it is bestowed, and, consequently, the value of the
annual produce of the land and labour of the whole country, the real
wealth and revenue of its inhabitants. If the prodigality of some was
not compensated by the frugality of others, the conduct of every
prodigal, by feeding the idle with the bread of the industrious, tends
not only to beggar himself, but to impoverish his country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1006">Though the expence of the prodigal should be altogether in homemade,<span class="type-margin"><span>Whether he spends on home or foreign commodities makes no difference.</span></span>
 and no part of it in foreign commodities, its effect upon the
productive funds of the society would still be the same. Every year
there would still be a certain quantity of food and clothing, which
ought to have maintained productive, employed in maintaining
unproductive hands. Every year, therefore, there would still be some
diminution in what would otherwise have been the value of the annual
produce of the land and labour of the country.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>322<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1007"><span class="type-margin"><span>If he had not spent there would have been just as much money in the country and the goods produced by productive hands as well</span></span>This
 expence, it may be said indeed, not being in foreign goods, and not
occasioning any exportation of gold and silver, the same quantity of
money would remain in the country as before. But if the quantity of food
 and clothing, which were thus consumed by unproductive, had been
distributed among productive hands, they would have re-produced,
together with a profit, the full value of their consumption. The same
quantity of money would in this case equally have remained in the
country, and there would besides have been a reproduction of an equal
value of consumable goods. There would have been two values instead of
one.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1008"><span class="type-margin"><span>Besides, when the annual produce diminishes, money will go abroad,</span></span>The
 same quantity of money, besides, cannot long remain in any country in
which the value of the annual produce diminishes. The sole use of money
is to circulate consumable goods. By means of it, provisions, materials,
 and finished work, are bought and sold, and distributed to their proper
 consumers. The quantity of money, therefore, which can be annually
employed in any country, must be determined by the value of the
consumable goods annually circulated within it. These must consist
either in the immediate produce of the land and labour of the country
itself, or in something which had been purchased with some part of that
produce. Their value, therefore, must diminish as the value of that
produce diminishes, and along with it the quantity of money which can be
 employed in circulating them. But the money which by this annual
diminution of produce is annually thrown out of domestic circulation,
will not be allowed to lie idle. The interest of whoever possesses it,
requires that it should be employed. But having no employment at home,
it will, in spite of all laws and prohibitions, be sent abroad, and
employed in purchasing consumable goods which may be of some use at
home. Its annual exportation will in this manner continue for some time
to add something to the annual consumption of the country beyond the
value of its own annual produce. What in the days of its prosperity had
been saved from that annual produce, and employed in purchasing gold and
 silver, will contribute for some little time to support its consumption
 in adversity. The exportation of gold and silver is, in this case, not
the cause, but the effect of its declension, and may even, for some
little time, alleviate the misery of that declension.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1009"><span class="type-margin"><span>and on the other hand money will come in when the annual produce increases.</span></span>The
 quantity of money, on the contrary, must in every country naturally
increase as the value of the annual produce increases. The value of the
consumable goods annually circulated within the society being greater,
will require a greater quantity of money to circulate them. A part of
the increased produce, therefore, will naturally be <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>323<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 employed in purchasing, wherever it is to be had, the additional
quantity of gold and silver necessary for circulating the rest. The
increase of those metals will in this case be the effect, not the cause,
 of the public prosperity. Gold and silver are purchased every-where in
the same manner. The food, clothing, and lodging, the revenue and
maintenance of all those whose labour or stock is employed in bringing
them from the mine to the market, is the price paid for them in Peru as
well as in England. The country which has this price to pay, will never
be long without the quantity of those metals which it has occasion for;
and no country will ever long retain a quantity which it has no occasion
 for.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1010">Whatever, therefore, we may imagine the real wealth and revenue<span class="type-margin"><span>So even if the real wealth of a country consisted of its money, the prodigal would be a public enemy.</span></span>
 of a country to consist in, whether in the value of the annual produce
of its land and labour, as plain reason seems to dictate; or in the
quantity of the precious metals which circulate within it, as vulgar
prejudices suppose; in either view of the matter, every prodigal appears
 to be a public enemy, and every frugal man a public benefactor.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1011">The effects of misconduct are often the same as those of prodigality.<span class="type-margin"><span>Injudicious employment of capital has the same effect as prodigality.</span></span>
 Every injudicious and unsuccessful project in agriculture, mines,
fisheries, trade, or manufactures, tends in the same manner to diminish
the funds destined for the maintenance of productive labour. In every
such project, though the capital is consumed by productive hands only,
yet, as by the injudicious manner in which they are employed, they do
not reproduce the full value of their consumption, there must always be
some diminution in what would otherwise have been the productive funds
of the society.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1012">It can seldom happen, indeed, that the circumstances of a great<span class="type-margin"><span>Frugality and prudence predominate.</span></span>
 nation can be much affected either by the prodigality or misconduct of
individuals; the profusion or imprudence of some, being always more than
 compensated by the frugality and good conduct of others.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1013">With regard to profusion, the principle which prompts to expence, is<span class="type-margin"><span>Prodigality is more intermittent than the desire to better our condition.</span></span>
 the passion for present enjoyment; which, though sometimes violent and
very difficult to be restrained, is in general only momentary and
occasional. But the principle which prompts to save, is the desire of
bettering our condition, a desire which, though generally calm and
dispassionate, comes with us from the womb, and never leaves us till we
go into the grave. In the whole interval which separates those two
moments, there is scarce perhaps a single instant<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt721" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt721_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> in which any man is so perfectly and completely satisfied with his situation, as to be without <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>324<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 any wish of alteration or improvement of any kind. An augmentation of
fortune is the means by which the greater part of men propose and wish
to better their condition. It is the means the most vulgar and the most
obvious; and the most likely way of augmenting their fortune, is to save
 and accumulate some part of what they acquire, either regularly and
annually, or upon some extraordinary occasions. Though the principle of
expence, therefore, prevails in almost all men upon some occasions, and
in some men upon almost all occasions, yet in the greater part of men,
taking the whole course of their life at an average, the principle of
frugality seems not only to predominate, but to predominate very
greatly.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1014"><span class="type-margin"><span>Imprudent undertakings are small in number compared to prudent ones.</span></span>With
 regard to misconduct, the number of prudent and successful undertakings
 is every-where much greater than that of injudicious and unsuccessful
ones. After all our complaints of the frequency of bankruptcies, the
unhappy men who fall into this misfortune make but a very small part of
the whole number engaged in trade, and all other sorts of business; not
much more perhaps than one in a thousand. Bankruptcy is perhaps the
greatest and most humiliating calamity which can befal an innocent man.
The greater part of men, therefore, are sufficiently careful to avoid
it. Some, indeed, do not avoid it; as some do not avoid the gallows.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1015"><span class="type-margin"><span>Public prodigality and imprudence are more to be feared than private,</span></span>Great nations are never impoverished<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt722" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt722_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 by private, though they sometimes are by public prodigality and
misconduct. The whole, or almost the whole public revenue, is in most
countries employed in maintaining unproductive hands. Such are the
people who compose a numerous and splendid court, a great ecclesiastical
 establishment, great fleets and armies, who in time of peace produce
nothing, and in time of war acquire nothing which can compensate the
expence of maintaining them, even while the war lasts. Such people, as
they themselves produce nothing, are all maintained by the produce of
other men’s labour. When multiplied, therefore, to an unnecessary
number, they may in a particular year consume so great a share of this
produce, as not to leave a sufficiency for maintaining the productive
labourers, who should reproduce it next year. The next year’s produce,
therefore, will be less than that of the foregoing, and if the same
disorder should continue, that of the third year will be still less than
 that of the second. Those unproductive hands, who should be maintained
by a part only of the spare revenue of the people, may consume so great a
 share of their whole revenue, and thereby oblige so great a number <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>325<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 to encroach upon their capitals, upon the funds destined for the
maintenance of productive labour, that all the frugality and good
conduct of individuals may not be able to compensate the waste and
degradation of produce occasioned by this violent and forced
encroachment.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1016">This frugality and good conduct, however, is upon most occasions, it<span class="type-margin"><span>but are counteracted by private frugality and prudence.</span></span>
 appears from experience, sufficient to compensate, not only the private
 prodigality and misconduct of individuals, but the public extravagance
of government. The uniform, constant, and uninterrupted effort of every
man to better his condition, the principle from which public and
national, as well as private opulence is originally derived, is
frequently powerful enough to maintain the natural progress of things
toward improvement, in spite both of the extravagance of government, and
 of the greatest errors of administration. Like the unknown principle of
 animal life, it frequently restores health and vigour to the
constitution, in spite, not only of the disease, but of the absurd
prescriptions of the doctor.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1017">The annual produce of the land and labour of any nation can be<span class="type-margin"><span>To increase the produce of a nation an increase of capital is necessary.</span></span>
 increased in its value by no other means, but by increasing either the
number of its productive labourers, or the productive powers of those
labourers who had before been employed. The number of its productive
labourers, it is evident, can never be much increased, but in
consequence of an increase of capital, or of the funds destined for
maintaining them. The productive powers of the same number of labourers
cannot be increased, but in consequence either of some addition and
improvement to those machines and instruments which facilitate and
abridge labour; or of a more proper division and distribution of
employment. In either case an additional capital is almost always
required. It is by means of an additional capital only, that the
undertaker of any work can either provide his workmen with better
machinery, or make a more proper distribution of employment among them.
When the work to be done consists of a number of parts, to keep every
man constantly employed in one way, requires a much greater capital than
 where every man is occasionally employed in every different part of the
 work. When we compare, therefore, the state of<span class="type-margin"><span>If, therefore, the produce has increased, we may be sure the capital has increased.</span></span>
 a nation at two different periods, and find, that the annual produce of
 its land and labour is evidently greater at the latter than at the
former, that its lands are better cultivated, its manufactures more
numerous and more flourishing, and its trade more extensive, we may be
assured that its capital must have increased during the interval between
 those two periods, and that more must have been added to it by the good
 conduct of some, than had been taken from it either by the private <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>326<span class="bracket">]</span></span> misconduct of others, or by the public extravagance of government.<span class="type-margin"><span>This has been the case of almost all nations in peaceable times.</span></span>
 But we shall find this to have been the case of almost all nations, in
all tolerably quiet and peaceable times, even of those who have not
enjoyed the most prudent and parsimonious governments. To form a right
judgment of it, indeed, we must compare the state of the country at
periods somewhat distant from one another. The progress is frequently so
 gradual, that, at near periods, the improvement is not only not
sensible, but from the declension either of certain branches of
industry, or of certain districts of the country, things which sometimes
 happen though the country in general be<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt723" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt723_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> in great prosperity, there frequently arises a suspicion, that the riches and industry of the whole are decaying.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1018"><span class="type-margin"><span>England for example from 1660 to 1776,</span></span>The
 annual produce of the land and labour of England, for example, is
certainly much greater than it was, a little more than a century ago, at
 the restoration of Charles II. Though, at present, few people, I
believe, doubt of this, yet during this period, five years have seldom
passed away in which some book or pamphlet has not been published,
written too with such abilities as to gain some authority with the
public, and pretending to demonstrate that the wealth of the nation was
fast declining, that the country was depopulated, agriculture neglected,
 manufactures decaying, and trade undone. Nor have these publications
been all party pamphlets, the wretched offspring of falsehood and
venality. Many of them have been written by very candid and very
intelligent people; who wrote nothing but what they believed, and for no
 other reason but because they believed it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1019"><span class="type-margin"><span>or from 1558 to 1660,</span></span>The
 annual produce of the land and labour of England again, was certainly
much greater at the restoration, than we can suppose it to have been
about an hundred years before, at the accession of Elizabeth. At this
period too, we have all reason to believe, the country was much more
advanced in improvement, than it had been about a century before,
towards the close of the dissensions between the houses of York and
Lancaster. Even then it was, probably, in a better condition than it had
 been at the Norman conquest, and at the Norman conquest, than during
the confusion of the Saxon Heptarchy. Even at this early period, it was
certainly a more improved country than at the invasion of Julius Cæsar,
when its inhabitants were nearly in the same state with the savages in
North America.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1020"><span class="type-margin"><span>though there was much public and private profusion, and many other disorders and misfortunes occurred.</span></span>In
 each of those periods, however, there was, not only much private and
public profusion, many expensive and unnecessary wars, great perversion
of the annual produce from maintaining productive to maintain
unproductive hands; but sometimes, in the confusion of civil discord, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>327<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 such absolute waste and destruction of stock, as might be supposed, not
 only to retard, as it certainly did, the natural accumulation of
riches, but to have left the country, at the end of the period, poorer
than at the beginning. Thus, in the happiest and most fortunate period
of them all, that which has passed since the restoration, how many
disorders and misfortunes have occurred, which, could they have been
foreseen, not only the impoverishment, but the total ruin of the country
 would have been expected from them? The fire and the plague of London,
the two Dutch wars, the disorders of the revolution, the war in Ireland,
 the four expensive French wars of 1688, 1702,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt724" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt724_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 1742, and 1756, together with the two rebellions of 1715 and 1745. In
the course of the four French wars, the nation has contracted more than a
 hundred and forty-five millions of debt, over and above all the other
extraordinary annual expence which they occasioned, so that the whole
cannot be computed at less than two hundred millions. So great a share
of the annual produce of the land and labour of the country, has, since
the revolution, been employed upon different occasions, in maintaining
an extraordinary number of unproductive hands. But had not those wars
given this particular direction to so large a capital, the greater part
of it would naturally have been employed in maintaining productive
hands, whose labour would have replaced, with a profit, the whole value
of their consumption. The value of the annual produce of the land and
labour of the country, would have been considerably increased by it
every year, and every year’s increase would have augmented still more
that of the following year.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt725" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt725_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 More houses would have been built, more lands would have been improved,
 and those which had been improved before would have been better
cultivated, more manufactures would have been established, and those
which had been established before would have been more extended; and to
what height the real wealth and revenue of the country might, by this
time, have been raised, it is not perhaps very easy even to imagine.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1021">But though the profusion of government must, undoubtedly, have<span class="type-margin"><span>Private frugality and prudence have silently counteracted these circumstances.</span></span>
 retarded the natural progress of England towards wealth and
improvement, it has not been able to stop it. The annual produce of its
land and labour is, undoubtedly, much greater at present than it was
either at the restoration or at the revolution. The capital, therefore,
annually employed in cultivating this land, and in maintaining this
labour, must likewise be much greater. In the midst of all the exactions
 of government, this capital has been silently and gradually accumulated
 by the private frugality and good conduct of individuals, by their
universal, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>328<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 continual, and uninterrupted effort to better their own condition. It
is this effort, protected by law and allowed by liberty to exert itself
in the manner that is most advantageous, which has maintained the
progress of England towards opulence and improvement in almost all
former times, and which, it is to be hoped, will do so in all future
times. England, however, as it has never been blessed with a very
parsimonious government, so parsimony has at no time been the
characteristical virtue of its inhabitants. It is the highest
impertinence and presumption, therefore, in kings and ministers, to
pretend to watch over the œconomy of private people, and to restrain
their expence, either by sumptuary laws, or by prohibiting the
importation of foreign luxuries. They are themselves always, and without
 any exception, the greatest spendthrifts in the society. Let them look
well after their own expence, and they may safely trust private people
with theirs. If their own extravagance does not ruin the state, that of
their subjects never will.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1022"><span class="type-margin"><span>A part from increase or diminution of capital different kinds of expense may be distinguished.</span></span>As
 frugality increases, and prodigality diminishes the public capital, so
the conduct of those whose expence just equals their revenue, without
either accumulating or encroaching, neither increases nor diminishes it.
 Some modes of expence, however, seem to contribute more to the growth
of public opulence than others.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1023">The revenue of an individual may be spent,

 or it may be spent in things more durable, which can therefore be
accumulated, and in which every day’s expence may, as he chuses, either
alleviate or support and heighten the effect of that of the following
day. A man of fortune, for example, may either spend his revenue in a
profuse and sumptuous table, and in maintaining a great number of menial
 servants, and a multitude of dogs and horses; or contenting himself
with a frugal table and few attendants, he may lay out the greater part
of it in adorning his house or his country villa, in useful or
ornamental buildings, in useful or ornamental furniture, in collecting
books, statues, pictures; or in things more frivolous, jewels, baubles,
ingenious trinkets of different kinds; or, what is most trifling of all,
 in amassing a great wardrobe of fine clothes, like the favourite and
minister of a great prince who died a few years ago.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt726" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt726_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> Were two men of equal fortune to spend their revenue, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>329<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 the one chiefly in the one way, the other in the other, the
magnificence of the person whose expence had been chiefly in durable
commodities, would be continually increasing, every day’s expence
contributing something to support and heighten the effect of that of the
 following day : that of the other, on the contrary, would be no greater
 at the end of the period than at the beginning. The former too would,
at the end of the period, be the richer man of the two. He would have a
stock of goods of some kind or other, which, though it might not be
worth all that it cost, would always be worth something. No trace or
vestige of the expence of the latter would remain, and the effects of
ten or twenty years profusion would be as completely annihilated as if
they had never existed.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1024">As the one mode of expence is more favourable than the other to<span class="type-margin"><span>The same thing is true of a nation.</span></span>
 the opulence of an individual, so is it likewise to that of a nation.
The houses, the furniture, the clothing of the rich, in a little time,
become useful to the inferior and middling ranks of people. They are
able to purchase them when their superiors grow weary of them, and the
general accommodation of the whole people is thus gradually improved,
when this mode of expence becomes universal among men of fortune. In
countries which have long been rich, you will frequently find the
inferior ranks of people in possession both of houses and furniture
perfectly good and entire, but of which neither the one could have been
built, nor the other have been made for their use. What was formerly a
seat of the family of Seymour, is now an inn upon the Bath road.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt727" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt727_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The marriage-bed of James the First of Great Britain, which his Queen
brought with her from Denmark, as a present fit for a sovereign to make
to a sovereign, was, a few years ago, the ornament of an ale-house at
Dunfermline.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt728" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt728_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 In some ancient cities, which either have been long stationary, or have
 gone somewhat to decay, you will sometimes scarce find a single house
which could have been built for its present inhabitants. If you go into
those houses too, you will frequently find many excellent, though
antiquated pieces of furniture, which are still very fit for use, and
which could as little have been made for them. Noble palaces,
magnificent villas, great collections of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>330<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 books, statues, pictures, and other curiosities, are frequently both an
 ornament and an honour, not only to the neighbourhood, but to the whole
 country to which they belong. Versailles is an ornament and an honour
to France, Stowe and Wilton to England. Italy still continues to command
 some sort of veneration by the number of monuments of this kind which
it possesses, though the wealth which produced them has decayed, and
though<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt729" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt729_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> the genius which planned them seems to be extinguished, perhaps from not having the same employment.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1025"><span class="type-margin"><span>The former expense is easier to bring to an end,</span></span>The
 expence too, which is laid out in durable commodities, is favourable,
not only to accumulation, but to frugality. If a person should at any
time exceed in it, he can easily reform without exposing himself to the
censure of the public. To reduce very much the number of his servants,
to reform his table from great profusion to great frugality, to lay down
 his equipage after he has once set it up, are changes which cannot
escape the observation of his neighbours, and which are supposed to
imply some acknowledgment of preceding bad conduct. Few, therefore, of
those who have once been so unfortunate as to launch out too far into
this sort of expence, have afterwards the courage to reform, till ruin
and bankruptcy oblige them. But if a person has, at any time, been at
too great an expence in building, in furniture, in books or pictures, no
 imprudence can be inferred from his changing his conduct. These are
things in which further expence is frequently rendered unnecessary by
former expence; and when a person stops short, he appears to do so, not
because he has exceeded his fortune, but because he has satisfied his
fancy.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1026"><span class="type-margin"><span>and gives maintenance to more people.</span></span>The
 expence, besides, that is laid out in durable commodities, gives
maintenance, commonly, to a greater number of people, than that which is
 employed in the most profuse hospitality. Of two or three hundred
weight of provisions, which may sometimes be served up at a great
festival, one-half, perhaps, is thrown to the dunghill, and there is
always a great deal wasted and abused. But if the expence of this
entertainment had been employed in setting to work masons, carpenters,
upholsterers, mechanics, &amp;c.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt730" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt730_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 a quantity of provisions, of equal value, would have been distributed
among a still greater number of people, who would have bought them in
penny-worths and pound weights, and not have lost or thrown away a
single ounce of them. In the one way, besides, this expence maintains
productive, in the other unproductive hands. In the one way, therefore,
it increases, in the other, it does not increase, the exchangeable value
 of the annual produce of the land and labour of the country.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>331<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1027">I would not, however, by all this be understood to mean, that the<span class="type-margin"><span>It does not follow that it betokens a more generous spirit.</span></span>
 one species of expence always betokens a more liberal or generous
spirit than the other. When a man of fortune spends his revenue chiefly
in hospitality, he shares the greater part of it with his friends and
companions; but when he employs it in purchasing such durable
commodities, he often spends the whole upon his own person, and gives
nothing to any body without an equivalent. The latter species of
expence, therefore, especially when directed towards frivolous objects,
the little ornaments of dress and furniture, jewels, trinkets, gewgaws,
frequently indicates, not only a trifling, but a base and selfish
disposition. All that I mean is, that the one sort of expence, as it
always occasions some accumulation of valuable commodities, as it is
more favourable to private frugality, and, consequently, to the increase
 of the public capital, and as it maintains productive, rather than
unproductive hands, conduces more than the other to the growth of public
 opulence.</p>

<h2 id="lf0206-01_label_791">CHAPTER IV: OF STOCK LENT AT INTEREST</h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-01_1028"><span class="type-margin"><span>Stock lent at interest is a capital to the lender, but may or may not be so to the borrower.</span></span>THE
 stock which is lent at interest is always considered as a capital by
the lender. He expects that in due time it is to be restored to him, and
 that in the mean time the borrower is to pay him a certain annual rent
for the use of it. The borrower may use it either as a capital, or as a
stock reserved for immediate consumption. If he uses it as a capital, he
 employs it in the maintenance of productive labourers, who reproduce
the value with a profit. He can, in this case, both restore the capital
and pay the interest without alienating or encroaching upon any other
source of revenue. If he uses it as a stock reserved for immediate
consumption, he acts the part of a prodigal, and dissipates in the
maintenance of the idle, what was destined for the support of the
industrious. He can, in this case, neither restore the capital nor pay
the interest, without either alienating or encroaching upon some other
source of revenue, such as the property or the rent of land.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1029"><span class="type-margin"><span>Generally it is so to the borrower,</span></span>The
 stock which is lent at interest is, no doubt, occasionally employed in
both these ways, but in the former much more frequently than in the
latter. The man who borrows in order to spend will soon be ruined, and
he who lends to him will generally have occasion to repent of his folly.
 To borrow or to lend for such a purpose, therefore, is in all cases,
where gross usury is out of the question, contrary to the interest of
both parties; and though it no doubt happens sometimes that people do
both the one and the other; yet, from the regard that all men have for
their own interest, we may be assured, that it cannot happen so very
frequently as we are sometimes apt to imagine. Ask any rich man of
common prudence, to which of the two sorts of people he has lent the
greater part of his stock, to those who, he thinks, will employ it
profitably, or to those who will spend it idly, and he will laugh at you
 for proposing the question. Even among borrowers, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>333<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 therefore, not the people in the world most famous for frugality, the
number of the frugal and industrious surpasses considerably that of the
prodigal and idle.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1030">The only people to whom stock is commonly lent, without their<span class="type-margin"><span>except in case of mortgages effected by country gentlemen.</span></span>
 being expected to make any very profitable use of it, are country
gentlemen who borrow upon mortgage. Even they scarce ever borrow merely
to spend. What they borrow, one may say, is commonly spent before they
borrow it. They have generally consumed so great a quantity of goods,
advanced to them upon credit by shopkeepers and tradesmen, that they
find it necessary to borrow at interest in order to pay the debt. The
capital borrowed replaces the capitals of those shopkeepers and
tradesmen, which the country gentlemen could not have replaced from the
rents of their estates. It is not properly borrowed in order to be
spent, but in order to replace a capital which had been spent before.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1031">Almost all loans at interest are made in money, either of paper, or of<span class="type-margin"><span>Loans are made in money, but what the borrower wants and gets is goods.</span></span>
 gold and silver. But what the borrower really wants, and what the
lender really supplies him with, is not the money, but the money’s
worth, or the goods which it can purchase. If he wants it as a stock for
 immediate consumption, it is those goods only which he can place in
that stock. If he wants it as a capital for employing industry, it is
from those goods only that the industrious can be furnished with the
tools, materials, and maintenance, necessary for carrying on their work.
 By means of the loan, the lender, as it were, assigns to the borrower
his right to a certain portion of the annual produce of the land and
labour of the country, to be employed as the borrower pleases.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt731" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt731_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1032">The quantity of stock, therefore, or, as it is commonly expressed, of<span class="type-margin"><span>So
 the quantity of stock which can be lent is determined by the value of
that part of the produce which replaces such capital as the owner does
not himself employ.</span></span> money which can be lent at interest in
 any country, is not regulated by the value of the money, whether paper
or coin, which serves as the instrument of the different loans made in
that country, but by the value of that part of the annual produce which,
 as soon as it comes either from the ground, or from the hands of the
productive labourers, is destined not only for replacing a capital, but
such a capital as the owner does not care to be at the trouble of
employing himself. As such capitals are commonly lent out and paid back
in money, they constitute what is called the monied interest. It is
distinct, not only from the landed, but from the trading and
manufacturing interests, as in these last the owners themselves employ
their own capitals. Even in the monied interest, however, the money is,
as it were, but the deed of assignment, which conveys from one hand to
another those capitals <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>334<span class="bracket">]</span></span> which the owners do not care to employ themselves.<span class="type-margin"><span>This may be much greater than the actual money employed.</span></span>
 Those capitals may be greater in almost any proportion, than the amount
 of the money which serves as the instrument of their conveyance; the
same pieces of money successively serving for many different loans, as
well as for many different purchases. A, for example, lends to W a
thousand pounds, with which W immediately purchases of B a thousand
pounds worth of goods. B having no occasion for the money himself, lends
 the identical pieces to X, with which X immediately purchases of C
another thousand pounds worth of goods. C in the same manner, and for
the same reason, lends them to Y, who again purchases goods with them of
 D. In this manner the same pieces, either of coin or of paper, may, in
the course of a few days, serve as the instrument of three different
loans, and of three different purchases, each of which is, in value,
equal to the whole amount of those pieces. What the three monied men A,
B, and C, assign to the three borrowers, W, X, Y, is the power of making
 those purchases. In this power consist both the value and the use of
the loans. The stock lent by the three monied men, is equal to the value
 of the goods which can be purchased with it, and is three times greater
 than that of the money with which the purchases are made. Those loans,
however, may be all perfectly well secured, the goods purchased by the
different debtors being so employed, as, in due time, to bring back,
with a profit, an equal value either of coin or of paper. And as the
same pieces of money can thus serve as the instrument of different loans
 to three, or for the same reason, to thirty times their value, so they
may likewise successively serve as the instrument of repayment.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1033"><span class="type-margin"><span>The money is altogether different from what is actually assigned either as principal or interest.</span></span>A
 capital lent at interest may, in this manner, be considered as an
assignment from the lender to the borrower of a certain considerable
portion of the annual produce; upon condition that the borrower in
return shall, during the continuance of the loan, annually assign to the
 lender a smaller portion, called the interest; and at the end of it, a
portion equally considerable with that which had originally been
assigned to him, called the repayment. Though money, either coin or
paper, serves generally as the deed of assignment both to the smaller,
and to the more considerable portion, it is itself altogether different
from what is assigned by it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1034"><span class="type-margin"><span>The stock to be lent at interest naturally grows as the whole quantity of stock increases.</span></span>In
 proportion as that share of the annual produce which, as soon as it
comes either from the ground, or from the hands of the productive
labourers, is destined for replacing a capital, increases in any
country, what is called the monied interest naturally increases with it.
 The increase of those particular capitals from which the owners wish to
 <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>335<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 derive a revenue, without being at the trouble of employing them
themselves, naturally accompanies the general increase of capitals; or,
in other words, as stock increases, the quantity of stock to be lent at
interest grows gradually greater and greater.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1035">As the quantity of stock to be lent at interest increases, the interest,<span class="type-margin"><span>Interest falls as the quantity of stock to be lent increases,</span></span>
 or the price which must be paid for the use of that stock, necessarily
diminishes, not only from those general causes which make the market
price of things commonly diminish as their quantity increases, but from
other causes which are peculiar to this particular case. As capitals
increase in any country, the profits which can be made by employing them
 necessarily diminish.<span class="type-margin"><span>because profits diminish as it becomes more difficult to find a profitable method of employing new capital.</span></span>
 It becomes gradually more and more difficult to find within the country
 a profitable method of employing any new capital. There arises in
consequence a competition between different capitals, the owner of one
endeavouring to get possession of that employment which is occupied by
another. But upon most occasions he can hope to justle that other out of
 this employment, by no other means but by dealing upon more reasonable
terms. He must not only sell what he deals in somewhat cheaper, but in
order to get it to sell, he must sometimes too buy it dearer. The demand
 for productive labour, by the increase of the funds which are destined
for maintaining it, grows every day greater and greater. Labourers
easily find employment, but the owners of capitals find it difficult to
get labourers to employ. Their competition raises the wages of labour,
and sinks the profits of stock. But when the profits which can be made
by the use of a capital are in this manner diminished, as it were, at
both ends, the price which can be paid for the use of it, that is, the
rate of interest, must necessarily be diminished with them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1036">Mr. Locke, Mr. Law, and Mr. Montesquieu, as well as many other<span class="type-margin"><span>The notion that it was the discovery of the West Indies which lowered interest has been refuted by Hume.</span></span> writers,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt732" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt732_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 seem to have imagined that the increase of the quantity of gold and
silver, in consequence of the discovery of the Spanish West Indies, was
the real cause of the lowering of the rate of interest through the
greater part of Europe. Those metals, they say, having become of less
value themselves, the use of any particular portion of them necessarily
became of less value too, and consequently the price which could be paid
 for it. This notion, which at first sight seems so plausible, has been
so fully exposed by Mr. Hume,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt733" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt733_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> that it is, perhaps, unnecessary <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>336<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 to say any thing more about it. The following very short and plain
argument, however, may serve to explain more distinctly the fallacy
which seems to have misled those gentlemen.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1037"><span class="type-margin"><span>If £100 are
now required to purchase what £50 would have purchased then, £10 must
now be required to purchase what £5 would have purchased then.</span></span>Before
 the discovery of the Spanish West Indies, ten per cent. seems to have
been the common rate of interest through the greater part of Europe. It
has since that time in different countries sunk to six, five, four, and
three per cent. Let us suppose that in every particular country the
value of silver has sunk precisely in the same proportion as the rate of
 interest; and that in those countries, for example, where interest has
been reduced from ten to five per cent., the same quantity of silver can
 now purchase just half the quantity of goods which it could have
purchased before. This supposition will not, I believe, be found
any-where agreeable to the truth; but it is the most favourable to the
opinion which we are going to examine; and even upon this supposition it
 is utterly impossible that the lowering of the value of silver could
have the smallest tendency to lower the rate of interest. If a hundred
pounds are in those countries now of no more value than fifty pounds
were then, ten pounds must now be of no more value than five pounds were
 then. Whatever were the causes which lowered the value of the capital,
the same must necessarily have lowered that of the interest, and exactly
 in the same proportion. The proportion between the value of the capital
 and that of the interest, must have remained the same, though the rate
had never been altered. By altering the rate, on the contrary, the
proportion between those two values is necessarily altered. If a hundred
 pounds now are worth no more than fifty were then, five pounds now can
be worth no more than two pounds ten shillings were then. By reducing
the rate of interest, therefore, from ten to five per cent., we give for
 the use of a capital, which is supposed to be equal to one-half of its
former value, an interest which is equal to one-fourth only of the value
 of the former interest.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1038"><span class="type-margin"><span>An increase in the quantity of silver could only diminish its value.</span></span>Any
 increase in the quantity of silver, while that of the commodities
circulated by means of it remained the same, could have no other effect
than to diminish the value of that metal. The nominal value of all sorts
 of goods would be greater, but their real value would be precisely the
same as before. They would be exchanged for a greater number of pieces
of silver; but the quantity of labour which they could command, the
number of people whom they could maintain and employ, would be precisely
 the same. The capital of the country would be the same, though a
greater number of pieces might be requisite for conveying any equal
portion of it from one hand to another. The deeds of assignment, like
the conveyances of a verbose attorney, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>337<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 would be more cumbersome, but the thing assigned would be precisely the
 same as before, and could produce only the same effects. The funds for
maintaining productive labour being the same, the demand for it would be
 the same. Its price or wages, therefore, though nominally<span class="type-margin"><span>Nominal wages would be greater, but real wages the same; profits would be the same nominally and really.</span></span>
 greater, would really be the same. They would be paid in a greater
number of pieces of silver; but they would purchase only the same
quantity of goods. The profits of stock would be the same both nominally
 and really. The wages of labour are commonly computed by the quantity
of silver which is paid to the labourer. When that is increased,
therefore, his wages appear to be increased, though they may sometimes
be no greater than before. But the profits of stock are not computed by
the number of pieces of silver with which they are paid, but by the
proportion which those pieces bear to the whole capital employed. Thus
in a particular country five shillings a week are said to be the common
wages of labour, and ten per cent. the common profits of stock. But the
whole capital of the country being the same as before, the competition
between the different capitals of individuals into which it was divided
would likewise be the same. They would all trade with the same
advantages and disadvantages. The common proportion between capital and
profit, therefore, would be the same, and consequently the common
interest of money; what can commonly be given for the use of money being
 necessarily regulated by what can commonly be made by the use of it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1039">Any increase in the quantity of commodities annually circulated<span class="type-margin"><span>An increase in the goods annually circulated would cause a fall of profits and consequently of interest.</span></span>
 within the country, while that of the money which circulated them
remained the same, would, on the contrary, produce many other important
effects, besides that of raising the value of the money. The capital of
the country, though it might nominally be the same, would really be
augmented. It might continue to be expressed by the same quantity of
money, but it would command a greater quantity of labour. The quantity
of productive labour which it could maintain and employ would be
increased, and consequently the demand for that labour. Its wages would
naturally rise with the demand, and yet might appear to sink. They might
 be paid with a smaller quantity of money, but that smaller quantity
might purchase a greater quantity of goods than a greater had done
before. The profits of stock would be diminished both really and in
appearance. The whole capital of the country being augmented, the
competition between the different capitals of which it was composed,
would naturally be augmented along with it. The owners of those
particular capitals would be obliged to content themselves with a
smaller proportion of the produce of that labour <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>338<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 which their respective capitals employed. The interest of money,
keeping pace always with the profits of stock, might, in this manner, be
 greatly diminished, though the value of money, or the quantity of goods
 which any particular sum could purchase, was greatly augmented.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1040"><span class="type-margin"><span>The prohibition of interest is wrong, and increases the evil of usury.</span></span>In
 some countries the interest of money has been prohibited by law. But as
 something can every-where be made by the use of money, something ought
every-where to be paid for the use of it. This regulation, instead of
preventing, has been found from experience to increase the evil of
usury; the debtor being obliged to pay, not only for the use of the
money, but for the risk which his creditor runs by accepting a
compensation for that use. He is obliged, if one may say so, to insure
his creditor from the penalties of usury.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1041"><span class="type-margin"><span>Where a maximum rate is fixed, this should be somewhat above the market rate on good security,</span></span>In
 countries where interest is permitted, the law, in order to prevent the
 extortion of usury, generally fixes the highest rate which can be taken
 without incurring a penalty. This rate ought always to be somewhat
above the lowest market price, or the price which is commonly paid for
the use of money by those who can give the most undoubted security. If
this legal rate should be fixed below the lowest market rate, the
effects of this fixation must be nearly the same as those of a total
prohibition of interest. The creditor will not lend his money for less
than the use of it is worth, and the debtor must pay him for the risk
which he runs by accepting the full value of that use. If it is fixed
precisely at the lowest market price, it ruins with honest people, who
respect the laws of their country, the credit of all those who cannot
give the very best security, and obliges them to have recourse to
exorbitant usurers. In a country, such as Great Britain, where money is
lent to government at three per cent. and to private people upon good
security at four, and four and a half, the present legal rate, five per
cent., is perhaps, as proper as any.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1042"><span class="type-margin"><span>but not much above, or the greater part of loans would be to prodigals and projectors.</span></span>The
 legal rate, it is to be observed, though it ought to be somewhat above,
 ought not to be much above the lowest market rate. If the legal rate of
 interest in Great Britain, for example, was fixed so high as eight or
ten per cent., the greater part of the money which was to be lent, would
 be lent to prodigals and projectors, who alone would be willing to give
 this high interest. Sober people, who will give for the use of money no
 more than a part of what they are likely to make by the use of it,
would not venture into the competition. A great part of the capital of
the country would thus be kept out of the hands which were most likely
to make a profitable and advantageous use of it, and thrown into those

 Where the legal rate of interest, on the contrary, is fixed but a very
little above the lowest market rate, sober people are universally
preferred, as borrowers, to prodigals and projectors. The person who
lends money gets nearly as much interest from the former as he dares to
take from the latter, and his money is much safer in the hands of the
one set of people, than in those of the other. A great part of the
capital of the country is thus thrown into the hands in which it is most
 likely to be employed with advantage.</p>

 ordinary market rate at the time when that law is made. Notwithstanding
 the edict of 1766, by which the French king attempted to reduce the
rate of interest from five to four per cent., money continued to be lent
 in France at five per cent., the law being evaded in several different
ways.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt734" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt734_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>

 The person who has a capital from which he wishes to derive a revenue,
without taking the trouble to employ it himself, deliberates whether he
should buy land with it, or lend it out at interest. The superior
security of land, together with some other advantages which almost
every-where attend upon this species of property, will generally dispose
 him to content himself with a smaller revenue from land, than what he
might have by lending out his money at interest. These advantages are
sufficient to compensate a certain difference of revenue; but they will
compensate a certain difference only; and if the rent of land should
fall short of the interest of money by a greater difference, nobody
would buy land, which would soon reduce its ordinary price. On the
contrary, if the advantages should much more than compensate the
difference, every body would buy land, which again would soon raise its
ordinary price. When interest was at ten per cent., land was commonly
sold for ten and twelve years purchase. As interest sunk to six, five,
and four per cent., the price of land rose to twenty, five and twenty,
and thirty years purchase. The market rate of interest is higher in
France than in England; and the common price of land is lower. In
England it commonly sells at thirty; in France at twenty years purchase.</p>

<h2 id="lf0206-01_label_797">CHAPTER V: OF THE DIFFERENT EMPLOYMENT OF CAPITALS</h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-01_1045"><span class="type-margin"><span>The quantity of labour put in motion and the value added to the annual produce by capitals vary with their employment.</span></span>THOUGH
 all capitals are destined for the maintenance of productive labour
only, yet the quantity of that labour, which equal capitals are capable
of putting into motion, varies extremely according to the diversity of
their employment; as does likewise the value which that employment adds
to the annual produce of the land and labour of the country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1046">A capital may be employed in four different
ways: either, first, in procuring the rude produce annually required for
 the use and consumption of the society; or, secondly, in manufacturing
and preparing that rude produce for immediate use and consumption; or,
thirdly,<span class="type-margin"><span>There are four different ways of employing capital,</span></span>
 in transporting either the rude or manufactured produce from the places
 where they abound to those where they are wanted; or, lastly, in
dividing particular portions of either into such small parcels as suit
the occasional demands of those who want them. In the first way are
employed the capitals of all those who undertake the improvement or
cultivation of lands, mines, or fisheries; in the second, those of all
master manufacturers; in the third, those of all wholesale merchants;
and in the fourth, those of all retailers. It is difficult to conceive
that a capital should be employed in any way which may not be classed
under some one or other of those four.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1047"><span class="type-margin"><span>all of which are necessary,</span></span>Each
 of those four methods of employing a capital is essentially necessary
either to the existence or extension of the other three, or to the
general conveniency of the society.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1048"><span class="type-margin"><span>(1) procuring rude produce,</span></span>Unless
 a capital was employed in furnishing rude produce to a certain degree
of abundance, neither manufactures nor trade of any kind could exist.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1049"><span class="type-margin"><span>(2) manufacturing,</span></span>Unless
 a capital was employed in manufacturing that part of the rude produce
which requires a good deal of preparation before it can be fit for use
and consumption, it either would never be produced, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>341<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 because there could be no demand for it; or if it was produced
spontaneously, it would be of no value in exchange, and could add
nothing to the wealth of the society.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1050">Unless a capital was employed in transporting, either the rude or<span class="type-margin"><span>(3) transportation,</span></span>
 manufactured produce, from the places where it abounds to those where
it is wanted, no more of either could be produced than was necessary for
 the consumption of the neighbourhood. The capital of the merchant
exchanges the surplus produce of one place for that of another, and thus
 encourages the industry and increases the enjoyments of both.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1051">Unless a capital was employed in breaking and dividing certain<span class="type-margin"><span>and (4) distribution.</span></span>
 portions either of the rude or manufactured produce, into such small
parcels as suit the occasional demands of those who want them, every man
 would be obliged to purchase a greater quantity of the goods he wanted,
 than his immediate occasions required. If there was no such trade as a
butcher, for example, every man would be obliged to purchase a whole ox
or a whole sheep at a time. This would generally be inconvenient to the
rich, and much more so to the poor. If a poor workman was obliged to
purchase a month’s or six months provisions at a time, a great part of
the stock which he employs as a capital in the instruments of his trade,
 or in the furniture of his shop, and which yields him a revenue, he
would be forced to place in that part of his stock which is reserved for
 immediate consumption, and which yields him no revenue. Nothing can be
more convenient for such a person than to be able to purchase his
subsistence from day to day, or even from hour to hour, as he wants it.
He is thereby enabled to employ almost his whole stock as a capital. He
is thus enabled to furnish work to a greater value, and the profit,
which he makes by it in this way, much more than compensates the
additional price which the profit of the retailer imposes upon the
goods. The prejudices of some political writers against shopkeepers and
tradesmen, are altogether without foundation. So far is it from being
necessary, either to tax them, or to restrict their numbers, that they
can never be multiplied so as to hurt the publick, though they may so as
 to hurt one another. The quantity of grocery goods, for example, which
can be sold in a particular town, is limited by the demand of that town
and its<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt736" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt736_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 neighbourhood. The capital, therefore, which can be employed in the
grocery trade cannot exceed what is sufficient to purchase that
quantity. If this capital is divided between two different grocers,
their competition will tend to make both of them <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>342<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 sell cheaper, than if it were in the hands of one only; and if it were
divided among twenty, their competition would be just so much the
greater, and the chance of their combining together, in order to raise
the price, just so much the less. Their competition might perhaps ruin
some of themselves; but to take care of this is the business of the
parties concerned, and it may safely be trusted to their discretion. It
can never hurt either the consumer, or the producer; on the contrary, it
 must tend to make the retailers both sell cheaper and buy dearer, than
if the whole trade was monopolized by one or two persons. Some of them,
perhaps, may sometimes decoy a weak customer to buy what he has no
occasion for. This evil, however, is of too little importance to deserve
 the publick attention, nor would it necessarily be prevented by
restricting their numbers. It is not the multitude of ale-houses, to
give the most suspicious example, that occasions a general disposition
to drunkenness among the common people; but that disposition arising
from other causes necessarily gives employment to a multitude of
ale-houses.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1052"><span class="type-margin"><span>The employers of such capitals are productive labourers</span></span>The
 persons whose capitals are employed in any of those four ways are
themselves productive labourers. Their labour, when properly directed,
fixes and realizes itself in the subject or vendible commodity upon
which it is bestowed, and generally adds to its price the value at least
 of their own maintenance and consumption. The profits of the farmer, of
 the manufacturer, of the merchant, and retailer, are all drawn from the
 price of the goods which the two first produce, and the two last buy
and sell. Equal capitals, however, employed in each of those four
different ways, will immediately<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt737" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt737_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 put into motion very different quantities of productive labour, and
augment too in very different proportions the value of the annual
produce of the land and labour of the society to which they belong.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1053"><span class="type-margin"><span>the capital of the retailer employs only himself;</span></span>The
 capital of the retailer replaces, together with its profits, that of
the merchant of whom he purchases goods, and thereby enables him to
continue his business. The retailer himself is the only productive
labourer whom it immediately employs. In his profits, consists the whole
 value which its employment adds to the annual produce of the land and
labour of the society.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1054"><span class="type-margin"><span>the capital of the merchant employs sailors and carriers;</span></span>The
 capital of the wholesale merchant replaces, together with their
profits, the capitals of the farmers and manufacturers of whom he
purchases the rude and manufactured produce which he deals in, and
thereby enables them to continue their respective trades. It is by this
service chiefly that he contributes indirectly to support the productive
 <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>343<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 labour of the society, and to increase the value of its annual produce.
 His capital employs too the sailors and carriers who transport his
goods from one place to another, and it augments the price of those
goods by the value, not only of his profits, but of their wages. This is
 all the productive labour which it immediately puts into motion, and
all the value which it immediately adds to the annual produce. Its
operation in both these respects is a good deal superior to that of the
capital of the retailer.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1055">Part of the capital of the master manufacturer is employed as a<span class="type-margin"><span>the capital of the manufacturer employs his workmen;</span></span>
 fixed capital in the instruments of his trade, and replaces, together
with its profits, that of some other artificer of whom he purchases
them. Part of his circulating capital is employed in purchasing
materials, and replaces, with their profits, the capitals of the farmers
 and miners of whom he purchases them. But a great part of it is always,
 either annually, or in a much shorter period, distributed among the
different workmen whom he employs. It augments the value of those
materials by their wages, and by their masters profits upon the whole
stock of wages, materials, and instruments of trade employed in the
business. It puts immediately<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt738" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt738_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 into motion, therefore, a much greater quantity of productive labour,
and adds a much greater value to the annual produce of the land and
labour of the society, than an equal capital in the hands of any
wholesale merchant.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1056">No equal capital puts into motion a greater quantity of productive<span class="type-margin"><span>the
 capital of the farmer employs his servants and his cattle, and adds a
much greater value to the annual produce than other capital.</span></span>
 labour than that of the farmer. Not only his labouring servants, but
his labouring cattle, are productive labourers. In agriculture too
nature labours along with man; and though her labour costs no expence,
its produce has its value, as well as that of the most expensive
workmen. The most important operations of agriculture seem intended, not
 so much to increase, though they do that too, as to direct the
fertility of nature towards the production of the plants most profitable
 to man. A field overgrown with briars and brambles may frequently
produce as great a quantity of vegetables as the best cultivated
vineyard or corn field. Planting and tillage frequently regulate more
than they animate the active fertility of nature; and after all their
labour, a great part of the work always remains to be done by her. The
labourers and labouring cattle, therefore, employed in agriculture, not
only occasion, like the workmen in manufactures, the reproduction of a
value equal to their own consumption, or to the capital which employs
them, together with its owners profits; but of a much greater value.
Over and above the capital of the farmer and all its profits, they
regularly occasion the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>344<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 reproduction of the rent of the landlord. This rent may be considered
as the produce of those powers of nature, the use of which the landlord
lends to the farmer. It is greater or smaller according to the supposed
extent of those powers, or in other words, according to the supposed
natural or improved fertility of the land. It is the work of nature
which remains after deducting or compensating every thing which can be
regarded as the work of man. It is seldom less than a fourth, and
frequently more than a third of the whole produce. No equal quantity of
productive labour employed in manufactures can ever occasion so great a
reproduction. In them nature does nothing; man does all; and the
reproduction must always be in proportion to the strength of the agents
that occasion it. The capital employed in agriculture, therefore, not
only puts into motion a greater quantity of productive labour than any
equal capital employed in manufactures, but in proportion too to the
quantity of productive labour which it employs, it adds a much greater
value to the annual produce of the land and labour of the country, to
the real wealth and revenue of its inhabitants. Of all the ways in which
 a capital can be employed, it is by far the most advantageous to the
society.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1057"><span class="type-margin"><span>Capitals employed in agriculture and retail trade must reside within the country,</span></span>The
 capitals employed in the agriculture and in the retail trade of any
society, must always reside within that society. Their employment is
confined almost to a precise spot, to the farm, and to the shop of the
retailer. They must generally too, though there are some exceptions to
this, belong to resident members of the society.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1058"><span class="type-margin"><span>the capital of the merchant may reside anywhere;</span></span>The
 capital of a wholesale merchant, on the contrary, seems to have no
fixed or necessary residence anywhere, but may wander about from place
to place, according as it can either buy cheap or sell dear.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1059"><span class="type-margin"><span>the capital of the manufacturer must be where the manufacture is, but that is not necessarily determined.</span></span>The
 capital of the manufacturer must no doubt reside where the manufacture
is carried on; but where this shall be is not always necessarily
determined. It may frequently be at a great distance both from the place
 where the materials grow, and from that where the complete manufacture
is consumed. Lyons is very distant both from the places which afford the
 materials of its manufactures, and from those which consume them. The
people of fashion in Sicily are cloathed in silks made in other
countries, from the materials which their own produces. Part of the wool
 of Spain is manufactured in Great Britain, and some part of that cloth
is afterwards sent back to Spain.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1060"><span class="type-margin"><span>Whether the merchant who exports belongs to the country or not makes little difference.</span></span>Whether
 the merchant whose capital exports the surplus produce of any society
be a native or a foreigner, is of very little importance. If he is a
foreigner, the number of their productive labourers is necessarily less
than if he had been a native by one man only; and the value of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>345<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 their annual produce, by the profits of that one man. The sailors or
carriers whom he employs may still belong indifferently either to his
country, or to their country, or to some third country, in the same
manner as if he had been a native. The capital of a foreigner gives a
value to their surplus produce equally with that of a native, by
exchanging it for something for which there is a demand at home. It as
effectually replaces the capital of the person who produces that
surplus, and as effectually enables him to continue his business; the
service by which the capital of a wholesale merchant chiefly contributes
 to support the productive labour, and to augment the value of the
annual produce of the society to which he belongs.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1061">It is of more consequence that the capital of the manufacturer should<span class="type-margin"><span>The
 capital of the manufacturer will put into motion more native labour if
it resides within the country, but may be useful even if outside it.</span></span>
 reside within the country. It necessarily puts into motion a greater
quantity of productive labour, and adds a greater value to the annual
produce of the land and labour of the society. It may, however, be very
useful to the country, though it should not reside within it. The
capitals of the British manufacturers who work up the flax and hemp
annually imported from the coasts of the Baltic, are surely very useful
to the countries which produce them. Those materials are a part of the
surplus produce of those countries which, unless it was annually
exchanged for something which is in demand there, would be of no value,
and would soon cease to be produced. The merchants who export it,
replace the capitals of the people who produce it, and thereby encourage
 them to continue the production; and the British manufacturers replace
the capitals of those merchants.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1062">A particular country, in the same manner as a particular person, may<span class="type-margin"><span>Particular countries often have not enough capital for cultivation, manufactures, and transportation</span></span>
 frequently not have capital sufficient both to improve and cultivate
all its lands, to manufacture and prepare their whole rude produce for
immediate use and consumption, and to transport the surplus part either
of the rude or manufactured produce to those distant markets where it
can be exchanged for something for which there is a demand at home. The
inhabitants of many different parts of Great Britain have not capital
sufficient to improve and cultivate all their lands. The wool of the
southern counties of Scotland is, a great part of it, after a long land
carriage through very bad roads, manufactured in Yorkshire, for want of a
 capital to manufacture it at home. There are many little manufacturing
towns in Great Britain, of which the inhabitants have not capital
sufficient to transport the produce of their own industry to those
distant markets where there is demand and consumption for it. If there
are any merchants among them, they are properly only the agents of
wealthier merchants who reside in some of the greater commercial cities.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>346<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1063"><span class="type-margin"><span>In such cases the larger the proportion employed in agriculture, the larger will be the annual produce.</span></span>When
 the capital of any country is not sufficient for all those three
purposes, in proportion as a greater share of it is employed in
agriculture, the greater will be the quantity of productive labour which
 it puts into motion within the country; as will likewise be the value
which its employment adds to the annual produce of the land and labour
of the society. After agriculture, the capital employed in manufactures
puts into motion the greatest quantity of productive labour, and adds
the greatest value to the annual produce. That which is employed in the
trade of exportation, has the least effect of any of the three.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1064"><span class="type-margin"><span>The quickest way to make the capital sufficient for all these purposes is to begin with the most profitable.</span></span>The
 country, indeed, which has not capital sufficient for all those three
purposes, has not arrived at that degree of opulence for which it seems
naturally destined. To attempt, however, prematurely and with an
insufficient capital, to do all the three, is certainly not the shortest
 way for a society, no more than it would be for an individual, to
acquire a sufficient one. The capital of all the individuals of a
nation, has its limits in the same manner as that of a single
individual, and is capable of executing only certain purposes. The
capital of all the individuals of a nation is increased in the same
manner as that of a single individual, by their continually accumulating
 and adding to it whatever they save out of their revenue. It is likely
to increase the fastest, therefore, when it is employed in the way that
affords the greatest revenue to all the inhabitants of the country, as
they will thus be enabled to make the greatest savings. But the revenue
of all the inhabitants of the country is necessarily in proportion to
the value of the annual produce of their land and labour.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1065"><span class="type-margin"><span>That they have done so is the principal cause of the progress of the American colonies.</span></span>It
 has been the principal cause of the rapid progress of our American
colonies towards wealth and greatness, that almost their whole capitals
have hitherto been employed in agriculture.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt739" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt739_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 They have no manufactures, those houshold and coarser manufactures
excepted which necessarily accompany the progress of agriculture, and
which are the work of the women and children in every private family.
The greater part both of the exportation and coasting trade of America,
is carried on by the capitals of merchants who reside in Great Britain.
Even the stores and warehouses from which goods are retailed in some
provinces, particularly in Virginia and Maryland, belong many of them to
 merchants who reside in the mother country, and afford one of the few
instances of the retail trade of a society being carried on by the
capitals of those who are not resident members of it. Were the
Americans, either by combination or by any other sort of violence, to
stop the importation of European manufactures, and, by thus giving a
monopoly <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>347<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 to such of their own countrymen as could manufacture the like goods,
divert any considerable part of their capital into this employment, they
 would retard instead of accelerating the further increase in the value
of their annual produce, and would obstruct instead of promoting the
progress of their country towards real wealth and greatness. This would
be still more the case, were they to attempt, in the same manner, to
monopolize to themselves their whole exportation trade.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1066">The course of human prosperity, indeed, seems scarce ever to have<span class="type-margin"><span>Great countries have scarcely ever acquired sufficient capital for all those purposes.</span></span>
 been of so long continuance as to enable any great country to acquire
capital sufficient for all those three purposes; unless, perhaps, we
give credit to the wonderful accounts of the wealth and cultivation of
China, of those of antient Egypt, and of the antient state of Indostan.
Even those three countries, the wealthiest, according to all accounts,
that ever were in the world, are chiefly renowned for their superiority
in agriculture and manufactures. They do not appear to have been eminent
 for foreign trade. The antient Egyptians had a superstitious antipathy
to the sea;<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt740" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt740_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 a superstition nearly of the same kind prevails among the Indians; and
the Chinese have never excelled in foreign commerce. The greater part of
 the surplus produce of all those three countries seems to have been
always exported by foreigners, who gave in exchange for it something
else for which they found a demand there, frequently gold and silver.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1067">It is thus that the same capital will in any country put into motion a<span class="type-margin"><span>Different
 kinds of wholesale trade employ different quantities of productive
labour and add different amounts to the annual produce.</span></span>
greater or smaller quantity of productive labour, and add a greater or
smaller value to the annual produce of its land and labour, according to
 the different proportions in which it is employed in agriculture,
manufactures, and wholesale trade. The difference too is very great,
according to the different sorts of wholesale trade in which any part of
 it is employed.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1068">All wholesale trade, all buying in order to
sell again by wholesale, may be reduced to three different sorts. The
home trade, the foreign trade of consumption, and the carrying trade.<span class="type-margin"><span>There are three different kinds of trade home, foreign and carrying.</span></span>
 The home trade is employed in purchasing in one part of the same
country, and selling in another, the produce of the industry of that
country. It comprehends both the inland and the coasting trade. The
foreign trade of consumption is employed in purchasing foreign goods for
 home consumption. The carrying trade is employed in transacting the
commerce <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>348<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of foreign countries, or in carrying the surplus produce of one to another.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1069"><span class="type-margin"><span>Capital employed in buying in one part of the country to sell in another replaces two domestic capitals.</span></span>The
 capital which is employed in purchasing in one part of the country in
order to sell in another the produce of the industry of that country,
generally replaces by every such operation two distinct capitals that
had both been employed in the agriculture or manufactures of that
country, and thereby enables them to continue that employment. When it
sends out from the residence of the merchant a certain value of
commodities, it generally brings back in return at least an equal value
of other commodities. When both are the produce of domestick industry,
it necessarily replaces by every such operation two distinct capitals,
which had both been employed in supporting productive labour, and
thereby enables them to continue that support. The capital which sends
Scotch manufactures to London, and brings back English corn and
manufactures to Edinburgh, necessarily replaces, by every such
operation, two British capitals which had both been employed in the
agriculture or manufactures of Great Britain.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1070"><span class="type-margin"><span>Capital employed in importation replaces one domestic and one foreign capital.</span></span>The
 capital employed in purchasing foreign goods for home-consumption, when
 this purchase is made with the produce of domestick industry, replaces
too, by every such operation, two distinct capitals; but one of them
only is employed in supporting domestick industry. The capital which
sends British goods to Portugal, and brings back Portuguese goods to
Great Britain, replaces by every such operation only one British
capital. The other is a Portuguese one. Though the returns, therefore,
of the foreign trade of consumption should be as quick as those of the
home-trade, the capital employed in it will give but one-half the
encouragement to the industry or productive labour of the country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1071"><span class="type-margin"><span>Its returns are not so quick as those of home trade.</span></span>But
 the returns of the foreign trade of consumption are very seldom so
quick as those of the home-trade. The returns of the home-trade
generally come in before the end of the year, and sometimes three or
four times in the year. The returns of the foreign trade of consumption
seldom come in before the end of the year, and sometimes not till after
two or three years. A capital, therefore, employed in the home-trade
will sometimes make twelve operations, or be sent out and returned
twelve times, before a capital employed in the foreign trade of
consumption has made one. If the capitals are equal, therefore, the one
will give four and twenty times more encouragement and support to the
industry of the country than the other.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt741" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt741_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>

 not with the produce of domestick industry, but with some other foreign
 goods. These last, however, must have been purchased either immediately
 with the produce of domestick industry, or with something else that had
 been purchased with it; for the case of war and conquest excepted,
foreign goods can never be acquired, but in exchange for something that
had been produced at home, either immediately, or after two or more
different exchanges. The effects, therefore, of a capital employed in
such a round-about foreign trade of consumption, are, in every respect,
the same as those of one employed in the most direct trade of the same
kind, except that the final returns are likely to be still more distant,
 as they must depend upon the returns of two or three distinct foreign
trades. If the flax and hemp of Riga are purchased with the tobacco of
Virginia, which had been purchased with British manufactures, the
merchant must wait for the returns of two distinct foreign trades before
 he can employ the same capital in re-purchasing a like quantity of
British manufactures. If the tobacco of Virginia had been purchased, not
 with British manufactures, but with the sugar and rum of Jamaica which
had been purchased with those manufactures, he must wait for the returns
 of three. If those two or three distinct foreign trades should happen
to be carried on by two or three distinct merchants, of whom the second
buys the goods imported by the first, and the third buys those imported
by the second, in order to export them again, each merchant indeed will
in this case receive the returns of his own capital more quickly; but
the final returns of the whole capital employed in the trade will be
just as slow as ever. Whether the whole capital employed in such a
round-about trade belong to one merchant or to three, can make no
difference with regard to the country, though it may with regard to the
particular merchants. Three times a greater capital must in both cases
be employed, in order to exchange a certain value of British
manufactures for a certain quantity of flax and hemp, than would have
been necessary, had the manufactures and the flax and hemp been directly
 exchanged for one another. The whole capital employed, therefore, in
such a round-about foreign trade of consumption, will generally give
less encouragement and support to the productive labour of the country,
than an equal capital employed in a more direct trade of the same kind.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1073">Whatever be the foreign commodity with which the foreign goods<span class="type-margin"><span>Foreign trade carried on by means of gold and silver is in no way different from the rest.</span></span>
 for home-consumption are purchased, it can occasion no essential
difference either in the nature of the trade, or in the encouragement
and <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>350<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 support which it can give to the productive labour of the country from
which it is carried on. If they are purchased with the gold of Brazil,
for example, or with the silver of Peru, this gold and silver, like the
tobacco of Virginia, must have been purchased with something that either
 was the produce of the industry of the country, or that had been
purchased with something else that was so. So far, therefore, as the
productive labour of the country is concerned, the foreign trade of
consumption which is carried on by means of gold and silver, has all the
 advantages and all the inconveniencies of any other equally round-about
 foreign trade of consumption, and will replace just as fast or just as
slow the capital which is immediately employed in supporting that
productive labour. It seems even to have one advantage over any other
equally round-about foreign trade. The transportation of those metals
from one place to another, on account of their small bulk and great
value, is less expensive than that of almost any other foreign goods of
equal value. Their freight is much less, and their insurance not
greater; and no goods, besides, are less liable to suffer by the
carriage.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt742" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt742_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 An equal quantity of foreign goods, therefore, may frequently be
purchased with a smaller quantity of the produce of domestick industry,
by the intervention of gold and silver, than by that of any other
foreign goods. The demand of the country may frequently, in this manner,
 be supplied more completely and at a smaller expence than in any other.
 Whether, by the continual exportation of those metals, a trade of this
kind is likely to impoverish the country from which it is carried on, in
 any other way, I shall have occasion to examine at great length
hereafter.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt743" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt743_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1074"><span class="type-margin"><span>Capital employed in the carrying trade replaces two foreign capitals.</span></span>That
 part of the capital of any country which is employed in the carrying
trade, is altogether withdrawn from supporting the productive labour of
that particular country, to support that of some foreign countries.
Though it may replace by every operation two distinct capitals, yet
neither of them belongs<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt744" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt744_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 to that particular country. The capital of the Dutch merchant, which
carries the corn of Poland to Portugal, and brings back the fruits and
wines of Portugal to Poland, replaces by every such operation two
capitals, neither of which had been employed in supporting the
productive labour of Holland; but one of them in supporting that of
Poland, and the other that of Portugal. The profits only return
regularly to Holland, and constitute the whole addition which this trade
 necessarily makes to the annual produce of<span class="type-margin"><span>It may employ ships and sailors belonging to the country, but this is not always the case,</span></span>
 the land and labour of that country. When, indeed, the carrying trade
of any particular country is carried on with the ships and sailors of
that <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>351<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 country, that part of the capital employed in it which pays the
freight, is distributed among, and puts into motion, a certain number of
 productive labourers of that country. Almost all nations that have had
any considerable share of the carrying trade have, in fact, carried it
on in this manner. The trade itself has probably derived its name from
it, the people of such countries being the carriers to other countries.
It does not, however, seem essential to the nature of the trade that it
should be so. A Dutch merchant may, for example, employ his capital in
transacting the commerce of Poland and Portugal, by carrying part of the
 surplus produce of the one to the other, not in Dutch, but in British
bottoms. It may be presumed, that he actually does so upon some
particular occasions. It is upon this account, however, that the<span class="type-margin"><span>and equal capital employed in importation or coasting trade may employ as many ships and men.</span></span>
 carrying trade has been supposed peculiarly advantageous to such a
country as Great Britain, of which the defence and security depend upon
the number of its sailors and shipping. But the same capital may employ
as many sailors and shipping, either in the foreign trade of
consumption, or even in the home-trade, when carried on by coasting
vessels, as it could in the carrying trade. The number of sailors and
shipping which any particular capital can employ, does not depend upon
the nature of the trade, but partly upon the bulk of the goods in
proportion to their value, and partly upon the distance of the ports
between which they are to be carried; chiefly upon the former of those
two circumstances. The coal-trade from Newcastle to London, for example,
 employs more shipping than all the carrying trade of England, though
the ports are at no great distance. To force, therefore, by
extraordinary encouragements, a larger share of the capital of any
country into the carrying trade, than what would naturally go to it,
will not always necessarily increase the shipping of that country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1075">The capital, therefore, employed in the home-trade of any country<span class="type-margin"><span>Capital
 in home trade therefore supports more productive labour than capital
employed in foreign trade, which, however, supports more than capital in
 the carrying trade Political economy ought consequently not to allure
capital into the foreign or the carrying trade,</span></span> will
generally give encouragement and support to a greater quantity of
productive labour in that country, and increase the value of its annual
produce more than an equal capital employed in the foreign trade of
consumption: and the capital employed in this latter trade has in both
these respects a still greater advantage over an equal capital employed
in the carrying trade. The riches, and so far as power depends upon
riches, the power of every country, must always be in proportion to the
value of its annual produce, the fund from which all taxes must
ultimately be paid. But the great object of the political œconomy of
every country, is to increase the riches and power of that country. It
ought, therefore, to give no preference nor superior encouragement to
the foreign trade of consumption above the home-trade, nor to the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>352<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 carrying trade above either of the other two. It ought neither to force
 nor to allure into either of those two channels, a greater share of the
 capital of the country than what would naturally flow into them of its
own accord.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1076">Each of those different branches of trade,
however, is not only advantageous, but necessary and unavoidable, when
the course of things,<span class="type-margin"><span>though each is advantageous when naturally introduced.</span></span> without any constraint or violence, naturally introduces it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1077">When the produce of any particular branch of
industry exceeds what the demand of the country requires, the surplus
must be sent abroad, and exchanged for something for which there is a
demand at home.<span class="type-margin"><span>The surplus of the produce of particular branches of industry must be sent abroad.</span></span> Without such exportation, a part of the productive labour of the country must cease,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt745" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt745_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 and the value of its annual produce diminish. The land and labour of
Great Britain produce generally more corn, woollens, and hard ware, than
 the demand of the home-market requires. The surplus part of them,
therefore, must be sent abroad, and exchanged for something for which
there is a demand at home. It is only by means of such exportation, that
 this surplus can acquire a value sufficient to compensate the labour
and expence of producing it. The neighbourhood of the sea coast, and the
 banks of all navigable rivers are advantageous situations for industry,
 only because they facilitate the exportation and exchange of such
surplus produce for something else which is more in demand there.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1078"><span class="type-margin"><span>Foreign goods obtained in exchange must often be reexported.</span></span>When
 the foreign goods which are thus purchased with the surplus produce of
domestic industry exceed the demand of the home-market, the surplus part
 of them must be sent abroad again, and exchanged for something more in
demand at home. About ninety-six thousand hogsheads of tobacco are
annually purchased in Virginia and Maryland, with a part of the surplus
produce of British industry. But the demand of Great Britain does not
require, perhaps, more than fourteen thousand.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt746" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt746_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 If the remaining eighty-two thousand, therefore, could not be sent
abroad and exchanged for something more in demand at home, the
importation of them must cease immediately, and with it the productive
labour of all those inhabitants of Great Britain, who are at present
employed in preparing the goods with which these eighty-two thousand
hogsheads are annually purchased. Those goods, which are part of the
produce of the land and labour of Great Britain, having no <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>353<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 market at home, and being deprived of that which they had abroad, must
cease to be produced. The most round-about foreign trade of consumption,
 therefore, may, upon some occasions, be as necessary for supporting the
 productive labour of the country, and the value of its annual produce,
as the most direct.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1079">When the capital stock of any country is increased to such a degree,<span class="type-margin"><span>When
 the other employments are full, the surplus capital disgorges itself
into the carrying trade, which is a symptom rather than a cause of great
 national wealth.</span></span> that it cannot be all employed in
supplying the consumption, and supporting the productive labour of that
particular country, the surplus part of it naturally disgorges itself
into the carrying trade, and is employed in performing the same offices
to other countries. The carrying trade is the natural effect and symptom
 of great national wealth; but it does not seem to be the natural cause
of it. Those statesmen who have been disposed to favour it with
particular encouragements, seem to have mistaken the effect and symptom
for the cause. Holland, in proportion to the extent of the land and the
number of its inhabitants, by far the richest country in Europe, has,
accordingly, the greatest share of the carrying trade of Europe.
England, perhaps the second richest country of Europe, is likewise
supposed to have a considerable share of it; though what commonly passes
 for the carrying trade of England, will frequently, perhaps, be found
to be no more than a round-about foreign trade of consumption. Such are,
 in a great measure, the trades which carry the goods of the East and
West Indies, and of America, to different European markets. Those goods
are generally purchased either immediately with the produce of British
industry, or with something else which had been purchased with that
produce, and the final returns of those trades are generally used or
consumed in Great Britain. The trade which is carried on in British
bottoms between the different ports of the Mediterranean, and some trade
 of the same kind carried on by British merchants between the different
ports of India, make, perhaps, the principal branches of what is
properly the carrying trade of Great Britain.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1080">The extent of the home-trade and of the capital which can be employed<span class="type-margin"><span>The possible extent of the carrying trade is much the greatest.</span></span>
 in it, is necessarily limited by the value of the surplus produce of
all those distant places within the country which have occasion to
exchange their respective productions with one another. That of the
foreign trade of consumption, by the value of the surplus produce of the
 whole country and of what can be purchased with it. That of the
carrying trade, by the value of the surplus produce of all the different
 countries in the world. Its possible extent, therefore, is in a manner
infinite in comparison of that of the other two, and is capable of
absorbing the greatest capitals.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>354<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1081"><span class="type-margin"><span>Agriculture does not yield sufficient profit to attract all the capital which it might absorb.</span></span>The
 consideration of his own private profit, is the sole motive which
determines the owner of any capital to employ it either in agriculture,
in manufactures, or in some particular branch of the wholesale or retail
 trade. The different quantities of productive labour which it may put
into motion, and the different values which it may add to the annual
produce of the land and labour of the society, according as it is
employed in one or other of those different ways, never enter into his
thoughts. In countries, therefore, where agriculture is the most
profitable of all employments, and farming and improving the most direct
 roads to a splendid fortune, the capitals of individuals will naturally
 be employed in the manner most advantageous to the whole society. The
profits of agriculture, however, seem to have no superiority over those
of other employments in any part of Europe. Projectors, indeed, in every
 corner of it, have within these few years amused the public with most
magnificent accounts of the profits to be made by the cultivation and
improvement of land. Without entering into any particular discussion of
their calculations, a very simple observation may satisfy us that the
result of them must be false. We see every day the most splendid
fortunes that have been acquired in the course of a single life by trade
 and manufactures, frequently from a very small capital, sometimes from
no capital. A single instance of such a fortune acquired by agriculture
in the same time, and from such a capital, has not, perhaps, occurred in
 Europe during the course of the present century. In all the great
countries of Europe, however, much good land still remains uncultivated,
 and the greater part of what is cultivated, is far from being improved
to the degree of which it is capable. Agriculture, therefore, is almost
every-where capable of absorbing a much greater<span class="type-margin"><span>The reason will be explained in the next two books.</span></span>
 capital than has ever yet been employed in it. What circumstances in
the policy of Europe have given the trades which are carried on in towns
 so great an advantage over that which is carried on in the country,
that private persons frequently find it more for their advantage to
employ their capitals in the most distant carrying trades of Asia and
America, than in the improvement and cultivation of the most fertile
fields in their own neighbourhood, I shall endeavour to explain at full
length in the two following books.</p>

<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-01_1082">THE great commerce of every civilized society, is that carried on<span class="type-margin"><span>The great commerce is that between town and country, which is obviously advantageous to both.</span></span>
 between the inhabitants of the town and those of the country. It
consists in the exchange of rude for manufactured produce, either
immediately, or by the intervention of money, or of some sort of paper
which represents money. The country supplies the town with the means of
subsistence, and the materials of manufacture. The town repays this
supply by sending back a part of the manufactured produce to the
inhabitants of the country. The town, in which there neither is nor can
be any reproduction of substances,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt747" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt747_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 may very properly be said to gain its whole wealth and subsistence from
 the country. We must not, however, upon this account, imagine that the
gain of the town is the loss of the country. The gains of both are
mutual and reciprocal, and the division of labour is in this, as in all
other cases, advantageous to all the different persons employed in the
various occupations into which it is subdivided. The inhabitants of the
country purchase of the town a greater quantity of manufactured goods,
with the produce of a much smaller quantity of their own labour, than
they must have employed had they attempted to prepare them themselves.
The town affords a market for the surplus produce of the country, or
what is over and above the maintenance of the cultivators, and it is
there that the inhabitants of the country exchange <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>356<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 it for something else which is in demand among them. The greater the
number and revenue of the inhabitants of the town, the more extensive is
 the market which it affords to those of the country; and the more
extensive that market, it is always the more advantageous to a great
number. The corn which grows within a mile of the town, sells there for
the same price with that which comes from twenty miles distance. But the
 price of the latter must generally, not only pay the expence of raising
 and bringing it to market, but afford too the ordinary profits of
agriculture to the farmer. The proprietors and cultivators of the
country, therefore, which lies in the neighbourhood of the town, over
and above the ordinary profits of agriculture, gain, in the price of
what they sell, the whole value of the carriage of the like produce that
 is brought from more distant parts, and they save, besides, the whole
value of this carriage in the price of what they buy. Compare the
cultivation of the lands in the neighbourhood of any considerable town,
with that of those which lie at some distance from it, and you will
easily satisfy yourself how much the country is benefited by the
commerce of the town. Among all the absurd speculations that have been
propagated concerning the balance of trade, it has never been pretended
that either the country loses by its commerce with the town, or the town
 by that with the country which maintains it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1083"><span class="type-margin"><span>The cultivation of the country must be prior to the increase of the town,</span></span>As
 subsistence is, in the nature of things, prior to conveniency and
luxury, so the industry which procures the former, must necessarily be
prior to that which ministers to the latter. The cultivation and
improvement of the country, therefore, which affords subsistence, must,
necessarily, be prior to the increase of the town, which furnishes only
the means of conveniency and luxury. It is the surplus produce of the
country only, or what is over and above the maintenance of the
cultivators, that constitutes the subsistence of the town,<span class="type-margin"><span>though the town may sometimes be distant from the country from which it derives its subsistence.</span></span>
 which can therefore increase only with the increase of this surplus
produce. The town, indeed, may not always derive its whole subsistence
from the country in its neighbourhood, or even from the territory to
which it belongs, but from very distant countries; and this, though it
forms no exception from the general rule, has occasioned considerable
variations in the progress of opulence in different ages and nations.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1084"><span class="type-margin"><span>This order of things is favoured by the natural preference of man for agriculture.</span></span>That
 order of things which necessity imposes in general, though not in every
 particular country, is, in every particular country, promoted by the
natural inclinations of man. If human institutions had never thwarted
those natural inclinations, the towns could no-where have increased <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>357<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 beyond what the improvement and cultivation of the territory in which
they were situated could support; till such time, at least, as the whole
 of that territory was completely cultivated and improved. Upon equal,
or nearly equal profits, most men will chuse to employ their capitals
rather in the improvement and cultivation of land, than either in
manufactures or in foreign trade. The man who employs his capital in
land, has it more under his view and command, and his fortune is much
less liable to accidents, than that of the trader, who is obliged
frequently to commit it, not only to the winds and the waves, but to the
 more uncertain elements of human folly and injustice, by giving great
credits in distant countries to men, with whose character and situation
he can seldom be thoroughly acquainted. The capital of the landlord, on
the contrary, which is fixed in the improvement of his land, seems to be
 as well secured as the nature of human affairs can admit of. The beauty
 of the country besides, the pleasures of a country life, the
tranquillity of mind which it promises, and wherever the injustice of
human laws does not disturb it, the independency which it really
affords, have charms that more or less attract every body; and as to
cultivate the ground was the original destination of man, so in every
stage of his existence he seems to retain a predilection for this
primitive employment.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1085">Without the assistance of some artificers, indeed, the cultivation of land<span class="type-margin"><span>Cultivators
 require the assistance of artificers, who settle together and form a
village, and their employment augments with the improvement of the
country.</span></span> cannot be carried on, but with great
inconveniency and continual interruption. Smiths, carpenters,
wheel-wrights, and plough-wrights, masons, and bricklayers, tanners,
shoemakers, and taylors, are people, whose service the farmer has
frequent occasion for. Such artificers too stand, occasionally, in need
of the assistance of one another; and as their residence is not, like
that of the farmer, necessarily tied down to a precise spot, they
naturally settle in the neighbourhood of one another, and thus form a
small town or village. The butcher, the brewer, and the baker, soon join
 them, together with many other artificers and retailers, necessary or
useful for supplying their occasional wants, and who contribute still
further to augment the town. The inhabitants of the town and those of
the country are mutually the servants of one another. The town is a
continual fair or market, to which the inhabitants of the country
resort, in order to exchange their rude for manufactured produce.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt748" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt748_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 It is this commerce which supplies the inhabitants of the town both
with the materials of their work, and the means of their subsistence.
The quantity of the finished work <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>358<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 which they sell to the inhabitants of the country, necessarily
regulates the quantity of the materials and provisions which they buy.
Neither their employment nor subsistence, therefore, can augment, but in
 proportion to the augmentation of the demand from the country for
finished work; and this demand can augment only in proportion to the
extension of improvement and cultivation. Had human institutions,
therefore, never disturbed the natural course of things, the progressive
 wealth and increase of the towns would, in every political society, be
consequential, and in proportion to the improvement and cultivation of
the territory or country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1086"><span class="type-margin"><span>In the
American colonies an artificer who has acquired sufficient stock becomes
 a planter instead of manufacturing for distant sale,</span></span>In
our North American colonies, where uncultivated land is still to be had
upon easy terms, no manufactures for distant sale have ever yet been
established in any of their towns. When an artificer has acquired a
little more stock than is necessary for carrying on his own business in
supplying the neighbouring country, he does not, in North America,
attempt to establish with it a manufacture for more distant sale, but
employs it in the purchase and improvement of uncultivated land. From
artificer he becomes planter, and neither the large wages nor the easy
subsistence which that country affords to artificers, can bribe him
rather to work for other people than for himself. He feels that an
artificer is the servant of his customers, from whom he derives his
subsistence; but that a planter who cultivates his own land, and derives
 his necessary subsistence from the labour of his own family, is really a
 master, and independent of all the world.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1087"><span class="type-margin"><span>as in countries where no uncultivated land can be procured.</span></span>In
 countries, on the contrary, where there is either no uncultivated land,
 or none that can be had upon easy terms, every artificer who has
acquired more stock than he can employ in the occasional jobs of the
neighbourhood, endeavours to prepare work for more distant sale. The
smith erects some sort of iron, the weaver some sort of linen or woollen
 manufactory. Those different manufactures come, in process of time, to
be gradually subdivided, and thereby improved and refined in a great
variety of ways, which may easily be conceived, and which it is
therefore unnecessary to explain any further.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1088"><span class="type-margin"><span>Manufactures are naturally preferred to foreign commerce.</span></span>In
 seeking for employment to a capital, manufactures are, upon equal or
nearly equal profits, naturally preferred to foreign commerce, for the
same reason that agriculture is naturally preferred to manufactures. As
the capital of the landlord or farmer is more secure than that of the
manufacturer, so the capital of the manufacturer, being at all times
more within his view and command, is more secure than that of the
foreign merchant. In every period, indeed, of every society, the surplus
 part both of the rude and manufactured produce, or that for <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>359<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 which there is no demand at home, must be sent abroad in order to be
exchanged for something for which there is some demand at home. But
whether the capital, which carries this surplus produce abroad, be a
foreign or a domestic one, is of very little importance. If the society
has not acquired sufficient capital both to cultivate all its lands, and
 to manufacture in the completest manner the whole of its<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt749" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt749_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> rude produce, there is even a considerable advantage that that rude produce should<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt750" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt750_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 be exported by a foreign capital, in order that the whole stock of the
society may be employed in more useful purposes. The wealth of ancient
Egypt, that of China and Indostan, sufficiently demonstrate that a
nation may attain a very high degree of opulence, though the greater
part of its exportation trade be carried on by foreigners. The progress
of our North American and West Indian colonies would have been much less
 rapid, had no capital but what belonged to themselves been employed in
exporting their surplus produce.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1089">According to the natural course of things, therefore, the greater part<span class="type-margin"><span>So the natural course of things is first agriculture, then manufactures, and finally foreign commerce.</span></span>
 of the capital of every growing society is, first, directed to
agriculture, afterwards to manufactures, and last of all to foreign
commerce. This order of things is so very natural, that in every society
 that had any territory, it has always, I believe, been in some degree
observed. Some of their lands must have been cultivated before any
considerable towns could be established, and some sort of coarse
industry of the manufacturing kind must have been carried on in those
towns, before they could well think of employing themselves in foreign
commerce.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1090">But though this natural order of things must have taken place in<span class="type-margin"><span>But this order has been in many respects inverted.</span></span>
 some degree in every such society, it has, in all the modern states of
Europe, been, in many respects, entirely inverted. The foreign commerce
of some of their cities has introduced all their finer manufactures, or
such as were fit for distant sale; and manufactures and foreign commerce
 together, have given birth to the principal improvements of
agriculture. The manners and customs which the nature of their original
government introduced, and which remained after that government was
greatly altered, necessarily forced them into this unnatural and

<h2 id="lf0206-01_label_815">CHAPTER II: OF THE DISCOURAGEMENT OF AGRICULTURE IN THE ANCIENT STATE OF EUROPE AFTER THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE</h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-01_1091"><span class="type-margin"><span>After the fall of the Roman Empire all the land of Western Europe was engrossed, chiefly by large proprietors.</span></span>WHEN
 the German and Scythian nations over-ran the western provinces of the
Roman empire, the confusions which followed so great a revolution lasted
 for several centuries. The rapine and violence which the barbarians
exercised against the ancient inhabitants, interrupted the commerce
between the towns and the country. The towns were deserted, and the
country was left uncultivated, and the western provinces of Europe,
which had enjoyed a considerable degree of opulence under the Roman
empire, sunk into the lowest state of poverty and barbarism. During the
continuance of those confusions, the chiefs and principal leaders of
those nations, acquired or usurped to themselves the greater part of the
 lands of those countries. A great part of them was uncultivated; but no
 part of them, whether cultivated or uncultivated, was left without a
proprietor. All of them were engrossed, and the greater part by a few
great proprietors.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1092"><span class="type-margin"><span>Primogeniture and entails prevented the great estates being divided.</span></span>This
 original engrossing of uncultivated lands, though a great, might have
been but a transitory evil. They might soon have been divided again, and
 broke into small parcels either by succession or by alienation. The law
 of primogeniture hindered them from being divided by succession: the
introduction of entails prevented their being broke into small parcels
by alienation.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt751" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt751_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1093"><span class="type-margin"><span>Primogeniture was introduced because every great landlord was a petty prince.</span></span>When
 land, like moveables, is considered as the means only of subsistence
and enjoyment, the natural law of succession divides it, like them,
among all the children of the family; of all of whom the subsistence and
 enjoyment may be supposed equally dear to the father. This natural law
of succession accordingly took place among the Romans, who made no more
distinction between elder and younger, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>361<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 between male and female, in the inheritance of lands, than we do in the
 distribution of moveables. But when land was considered as the means,
not of subsistence merely, but of power and protection, it was thought
better that it should descend undivided to one. In those disorderly
times, every great landlord was a sort of petty prince. His tenants were
 his subjects. He was their judge, and in some respects their legislator
 in peace, and their leader in war. He made war according to his own
discretion, frequently against his neighbours, and sometimes against his
 sovereign. The security of a landed estate, therefore, the protection
which its owner could afford to those who dwelt on it, depended upon its
 greatness. To divide it was to ruin it, and to expose every part of it
to be oppressed and swallowed up by the incursions of its neighbours.
The law of primogeniture, therefore, came to take place, not
immediately, indeed, but in process of time, in the succession of landed
 estates, for the same reason that it has generally taken place in that
of monarchies, though not always at their first institution. That the
power, and consequently the security of the monarchy, may not be
weakened by division, it must descend entire to one of the children. To
which of them so important a preference shall be given, must be
determined by some general rule, founded not upon the doubtful
distinctions of personal merit, but upon some plain and evident
difference which can admit of no dispute. Among the children of the same
 family, there can be no indisputable difference but that of sex, and
that of age. The male sex is universally preferred to the female; and
when all other things are equal, the elder every-where takes place of
the younger. Hence the origin of the right of primogeniture, and of what
 is called lineal succession.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt752" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt752_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1094">Laws frequently continue in force long after the circumstances,<span class="type-margin"><span>It is now unreasonable, but supports the pride of family distinctions.</span></span>
 which first gave occasion to them, and which could alone render them
reasonable, are no more. In the present state of Europe, the proprietor
of a single acre of land is as perfectly secure of his possession as the
 proprietor of a hundred thousand. The right of primogeniture, however,
still continues to be respected, and as of all institutions it is the
fittest to support the pride of family distinctions, it is still likely
to endure for many centuries. In every other respect, nothing can be
more contrary to the real interest of a numerous family, than a right
which in order to enrich one, beggars all the rest of the children.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1095">Entails are the natural consequences of the law of primogeniture.<span class="type-margin"><span>Entails have the same origin,</span></span>
 They were introduced to preserve a certain lineal succession, of which
the law of primogeniture first gave the idea, and to hinder any part of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>362<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 the original estate from being carried out of the proposed line either
by gift, or devise, or alienation; either by the folly, or by the
misfortune of any of its successive owners. They were altogether unknown
 to the Romans. Neither their substitutions nor fideicommisses bear any
resemblance to entails, though some French lawyers have thought proper
to dress the modern institution in the language and garb<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt753" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt753_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> of those antient ones.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt754" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt754_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1096"><span class="type-margin"><span>and are now absurd.</span></span>When
 great landed estates were a sort of principalities, entails might not
be unreasonable. Like what are called the fundamental laws of some
monarchies, they might frequently hinder the security of thousands from
being endangered by the caprice or extravagance of one man. But in the
present state of Europe, when small as well as great estates derive
their security from the laws of their country, nothing can be more
completely absurd. They are founded upon the most absurd of all
suppositions, the supposition that every successive generation of men
have not an equal right to the earth, and to all that it possesses; but
that the property of the present generation should be restrained and
regulated according to the fancy of those who died perhaps five hundred
years ago.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt755" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt755_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 Entails, however, are still respected through the greater part of
Europe, in those countries particularly in which noble birth is a
necessary qualification for the enjoyment either of civil or military
honours. Entails are thought necessary for maintaining this exclusive
privilege of the nobility to the great offices and honours of their
country; and that order having usurped one unjust advantage over the
rest of their fellow-citizens, lest their poverty should render it
ridiculous, it is thought reasonable that they should have another. The
common law of England, indeed, is said to abhor perpetuities, and they
are accordingly more restricted there than in any other European
monarchy; though even England is not altogether without them. In
Scotland more than one-fifth, perhaps more than one-third part of the
whole lands of the country, are at present supposed to be<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt756" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt756_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> under strict entail.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1097"><span class="type-margin"><span>Great proprietors are seldom great improvers.</span></span>Great
 tracts of uncultivated land were, in this manner, not only engrossed by
 particular families, but the possibility of their being divided again
was as much as possible precluded for ever. It seldom happens, however,
that a great proprietor is a great improver. In the disorderly times
which gave birth to those barbarous institutions, the great proprietor <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>363<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 was sufficiently employed in defending his own territories, or in
extending his jurisdiction and authority over those of his neighbours.
He had no leisure to attend to the cultivation and improvement of land.
When the establishment of law and order afforded him this leisure, he
often wanted the inclination, and almost always the requisite abilities.
 If the expence of his house and person either equalled or exceeded his
revenue, as it did very frequently, he had no stock to employ in this
manner. If he was an œconomist, he generally found it more profitable to
 employ his annual savings in new purchases, than in the improvement of
his old estate. To improve land with profit, like all other commercial
projects, requires an exact attention to small savings and small gains,
of which a man born to a great fortune, even though naturally frugal, is
 very seldom capable. The situation of such a person naturally disposes
him to attend rather to ornament which pleases his fancy, than to profit
 for which he has so little occasion. The elegance of his dress, of his
equipage, of his house, and household furniture, are objects which from
his infancy he has been accustomed to have some anxiety about. The turn
of mind which this habit naturally forms, follows him when he comes to
think of the improvement of land. He embellishes perhaps four or five
hundred acres in the neighbourhood of his house, at ten times the
expence which the land is worth after all his improvements; and finds
that if he was to improve his whole estate in the same manner, and he
has little taste for any other, he would be a bankrupt before he had
finished the tenth part of it. There still remain in both parts of the
united kingdom some great estates which have continued without
interruption in the hands of the same family since the times of feudal
anarchy. Compare the present condition of those estates with the
possessions of the small proprietors in their neighbourhood, and you
will require no other argument to convince you how unfavourable such
extensive property is to improvement.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt757" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt757_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1098">If little improvement was to be expected from such great proprietors,<span class="type-margin"><span>The occupiers were not likely to improve, as they were slaves attached to the land and incapable of acquiring property.</span></span>
 still less was to be hoped for from those who occupied the land under
them. In the ancient state of Europe, the occupiers of land were all
tenants at will. They were all or almost all slaves; but their slavery
was of a milder kind than that known among the ancient Greeks and
Romans, or even in our West Indian colonies. They were supposed to
belong more directly to the land than to their master. They could,
therefore, be sold with it, but not separately. They could marry,
provided it was with the consent of their master; and he could not <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>364<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 afterwards dissolve the marriage by selling the man and wife to
different persons. If he maimed or murdered any of them, he was liable
to some penalty, though generally but to a small one. They were not,
however, capable of acquiring property. Whatever they acquired was
acquired to their master, and he could take it from them at pleasure.
Whatever cultivation and improvement could be carried on by means of
such slaves, was properly carried on by their master. It was at his
expence. The seed, the cattle, and the instruments of husbandry were all
 his. It was for his benefit. Such slaves could acquire nothing but
their daily maintenance. It was properly the proprietor himself,
therefore, that, in this case, occupied his own lands, and cultivated
them by his own bondmen. This species of slavery still subsists in
Russia, Poland, Hungary, Bohemia, Moravia, and other parts of Germany.
It is only in the western and south-western provinces of Europe, that it
 has gradually been abolished altogether.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt758" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt758_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1099"><span class="type-margin"><span>Slave labour is the dearest of all.</span></span>But
 if great improvements are seldom to be expected from great proprietors,
 they are least of all to be expected when they employ slaves for their
workmen. The experience of all ages and nations, I believe, demonstrates
 that the work done by slaves, though it appears to cost only their
maintenance, is in the end the dearest of any. A person who can acquire
no property, can have no other interest but to eat as much, and to
labour as little as possible. Whatever work he does beyond what is
sufficient to purchase his own maintenance, can be squeezed out of him
by violence only, and not by any interest of his own. In ancient Italy,
how much the cultivation of corn degenerated, how unprofitable it became
 to the master when it fell under the management of slaves, is remarked
by both Pliny and Columella.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt759" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt759_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 In the time of Aristotle it had not been much better in ancient Greece.
 Speaking of the ideal republic described in the laws of Plato, to
maintain five thousand idle men (the number of warriors supposed
necessary for its defence) together with their women and servants, would
 require, he says, a territory of boundless extent and fertility, like
the plains of Babylon.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt760" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt760_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1100"><span class="type-margin"><span>At present sugar and tobacco can afford slave cultivation, corn cannot.</span></span>The
 pride of man makes him love to domineer, and nothing mortifies him so
much as to be obliged to condescend to persuade his inferiors. Wherever
the law allows it, and the nature of the work can afford it, therefore,
he will generally prefer the service of slaves to that of freemen. <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>365<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 The planting of sugar and tobacco can afford the expence of slave
cultivation. The raising of corn, it seems, in the present times,
cannot. In the English colonies, of which the principal produce is corn,
 the far greater part of the work is done by freemen. The late
resolution of the Quakers in Pennsylvania to set at liberty all their
negro slaves,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt761" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt761_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 may satisfy us that their number cannot be very great. Had they made
any considerable part of their property, such a resolution could never
have been agreed to. In our sugar colonies, on the contrary, the whole
work is done by slaves, and in our tobacco colonies a very great part of
 it. The profits of a sugar-plantation in any of our West Indian
colonies are generally much greater than those of any other cultivation
that is known either in Europe or America: And the profits of a tobacco
plantation, though inferior to those of sugar, are superior to those of
corn, as has already been observed.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt762" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt762_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 Both can afford the expence of slave cultivation, but sugar can afford
it still better than tobacco. The number of negroes accordingly is much
greater, in proportion to that of whites, in our sugar than in our
tobacco colonies.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1101">To the slave cultivators of ancient times, gradually succeeded a<span class="type-margin"><span>The slaves were succeeded by metayers,</span></span>
 species of farmers known at present in France by the name of Metayers.
They are called in Latin, Coloni Partiarii. They have been so long in
disuse in England that at present I know no English name for them. The
proprietor furnished them with the seed, cattle, and instruments of
husbandry, the whole stock, in short, necessary for cultivating the
farm. The produce was divided equally between the proprietor and the
farmer, after setting aside what was judged necessary for keeping up the
 stock, which was restored to the proprietor when the farmer either
quitted, or was turned out of the farm.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt763" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt763_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1102">Land occupied by such tenants is properly cultivated at the expence<span class="type-margin"><span>who are very different in that they can acquire property.</span></span>
 of the proprietor, as much as that occupied by slaves. There is,
however, one very essential difference between them. Such tenants, being
 freemen, are capable of acquiring property, and having a certain
proportion of the produce of the land, they have a plain interest that
the whole produce should be as great as possible, in order that their
own proportion may be so. A slave, on the contrary, who can acquire
nothing but his maintenance, consults his own ease by making the land
produce as little as possible over and above that maintenance. It is
probable that it was partly upon account of this advantage, and partly
upon account of the encroachments which the sovereign, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>366<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 always jealous of the great lords, gradually encouraged their villains
to make upon their authority, and which seem at last to have been such
as rendered this species of servitude altogether inconvenient, that
tenure in villanage gradually wore out through the greater part of
Europe. The time and manner, however, in which so important a revolution
 was brought about, is one of the most obscure points in modern history.
 The church of Rome claims great merit in it; and it is certain that so
early as the twelfth century, Alexander III.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt764" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt764_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 published a bull for the general emancipation of slaves. It seems,
however, to have been rather a pious exhortation, than a law to which
exact obedience was required from the faithful. Slavery continued to
take place almost universally for several centuries afterwards, till it
was gradually abolished by the joint operation of the two interests
above mentioned, that of the proprietor on the one hand, and that of the
 sovereign on the other. A villain enfranchised, and at the same time
allowed to continue in possession of the land, having no stock of his
own, could cultivate it only by means of what the landlord advanced to
him, and must, therefore, have been what the French call a Metayer.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1103"><span class="type-margin"><span>But they could have no interest to employ stock in improvement.</span></span>It
 could never, however, be the interest even of this last species of
cultivators to lay out, in the further improvement of the land, any part
 of the little stock which they might save from their own share of the
produce, because the lord, who laid out nothing, was to get one-half of
whatever it produced. The tithe, which is but a tenth of the produce, is
 found to be a very great hindrance to improvement. A tax, therefore,
which amounted to one-half, must have been an effectual bar to it. It
might be the interest of a metayer to make the land produce as much as
could be brought out of it by means of the stock furnished by the
proprietor; but it could never be his interest to mix any part of his
own with it. In France, where five parts out of six of the whole kingdom
 are said to be still occupied by this species of cultivators,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt765" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt765_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 the proprietors complain that their metayers take every opportunity of
employing the masters cattle rather in carriage than in cultivation;
because in the one case they get the whole profits to themselves, in the
 other they share them with their landlord. This species of tenants
still subsists in some parts of Scotland. They are called steel-bow<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt766" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt766_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> tenants. <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>367<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 Those ancient English tenants, who are said by Chief Baron Gilbert and
Doctor Blackstone to have been rather bailiffs of the landlord than
farmers properly so called, were probably of the same kind.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt767" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt767_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1104">To this species of tenancy succeeded, though by very slow degrees,<span class="type-margin"><span>Metayers
 were followed by farmers, who sometimes find it to their interest to
improve when they have a lease, but leases were long insecure.</span></span>
 farmers properly so called, who cultivated the land with their own
stock, paying a rent certain to the landlord. When such farmers have a
lease for a term of years, they may sometimes find it for their interest
 to lay out part of their capital in the further improvement of the
farm; because they may sometimes expect to recover it, with a large
profit, before the expiration of the lease. The possession even of such
farmers, however, was long extremely precarious, and still is so in many
 parts of Europe. They could before the expiration of their term be
legally outed of their lease, by a new purchaser; in England, even by
the fictitious action of a common recovery. If they were turned out
illegally by the violence of their master, the action by which they
obtained redress was extremely imperfect. It did not always re-instate
them in the possession of the land, but gave them damages which never
amounted to the real loss. Even in England, the country perhaps of
Europe where the yeomanry has always been most respected, it was not
till about the 14th of Henry the VIIth that the action of ejectment was
invented,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt768" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt768_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 by which the tenant recovers, not damages only but possession, and in
which his claim is not necessarily concluded by the uncertain decision
of a single assize. This action has been found so effectual a remedy
that, in the modern practice, when the landlord has occasion to sue for
the possession of the land, he seldom makes use of the actions which
properly belong to him as landlord, the writ of right or the writ of
entry,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt769" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt769_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 but sues in the name of his tenant, by the writ of ejectment. In
England, therefore, the security of the tenant is equal to that of the
proprietor. In England besides a lease for life of forty shillings a
year<span class="type-margin"><span>The forty-shilling freeholder vote in England contributes to the security of the farmer.</span></span>
 value is a freehold, and entitles the lessee to vote for a member of
parliament; and as a great part of the yeomanry have freeholds of this
kind, the whole order becomes respectable to their landlords on account
of the political consideration which this gives them.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt770" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt770_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 There is, I believe, no-where in Europe, except in England, any
instance of the tenant building upon the land of which he had no lease,
and trusting that the honour of his landlord would take no advantage of
so important an improvement. Those laws and customs so favourable to the
 yeomanry, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>368<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 have perhaps contributed more to the present grandeur of England, than
all their boasted regulations of commerce taken together.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1105"><span class="type-margin"><span>The law of Scotland is not quite so favourable.</span></span>The
 law which secures the longest leases against successors of every kind
is, so far as I know, peculiar to Great Britain. It was introduced into
Scotland so early as 1449, by a law of James the IId.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt771" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt771_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Its beneficial influence, however, has been much obstructed by entails;
 the heirs of entail being generally restrained from letting leases for
any long term of years, frequently for more than one year. A late act of
 parliament<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt772" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt772_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 has, in this respect, somewhat slackened their fetters, though they are
 still by much too strait. In Scotland, besides, as no leasehold gives a
 vote for a member of parliament, the yeomanry are upon this account
less respectable to their landlords than in England.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1106"><span class="type-margin"><span>In the rest of Europe the farmer is less secure.</span></span>In
 other parts of Europe, after it was found convenient to secure tenants
both against heirs and purchasers, the term of their security was still
limited to a very short period; in France, for example, to nine years
from the commencement of the lease. It has in that country, indeed, been
 lately extended to twenty-seven,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt773" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt773_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 a period still too short to encourage the tenant to make the most
important improvements. The proprietors of land were anciently the
legislators of every part of Europe. The laws relating to land,
therefore, were all calculated for what they supposed the interest of
the proprietor. It was for his interest, they had imagined, that no
lease granted by any of his predecessors should hinder him from
enjoying, during a long term of years, the full value of his land.
Avarice and injustice are always short-sighted, and they did not foresee
 how much this regulation must obstruct improvement, and thereby hurt in
 the long-run the real interest of the landlord.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt774" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt774_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1107"><span class="type-margin"><span>Customary services were vexatious to the farmer,</span></span>The
 farmers too, besides paying the rent, were anciently, it was supposed,
bound to perform a great number of services to the landlord, which were
seldom either specified in the lease, or regulated by any precise rule,
but by the use and wont of the manor or barony. These services,
therefore, being almost entirely arbitrary, subjected the tenant to many
 vexations. In Scotland the abolition of all services, not precisely
stipulated in the lease,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt775" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt775_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a> has in the course of a few years very much altered for the better the condition of the yeomanry of that country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1108"><span class="type-margin"><span>and so also were compulsory labour on the roads,</span></span>The
 public services to which the yeomanry were bound, were not less
arbitrary than the private ones. To make and maintain the high roads, a
servitude which still subsists, I believe, every-where, though with
different degrees of oppression in different countries, was not the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>369<span class="bracket">]</span></span> only one. When the king’s troops, when his household or his officers of any kind passed through any part of the country,<span class="type-margin"><span>purveyance</span></span>
 the yeomanry were bound to provide them with horses, carriages, and
provisions, at a price regulated by the purveyor. Great Britain is, I
believe, the only monarchy in Europe where the oppression of purveyance
has been entirely abolished. It still subsists in France and Germany.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1109">The public taxes to which they were subject
were as irregular and oppressive as the services. The ancient lords,
though extremely unwilling to grant themselves any pecuniary aid to
their sovereign, easily<span class="type-margin"><span>and tallages.</span></span> allowed him to tallage, as they called it, their tenants,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt776" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt776_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 and had not knowledge enough to foresee how much this must in the end
affect their own revenue. The taille, as it still subsists in France,
may serve as an example of those ancient tallages. It is a tax upon the
supposed profits of the farmer, which they estimate by the stock that he
 has upon the farm. It is his interest, therefore, to appear to have as
little as possible, and consequently to employ as little as possible in
its cultivation, and none in its improvement. Should any stock happen to
 accumulate in the hands of a French farmer, the taille is almost equal
to a prohibition of its ever being employed upon the land. This tax
besides is supposed to dishonour whoever is subject to it, and to
degrade him below, not only the rank of a gentleman, but that of a
burgher, and whoever rents the lands of another becomes subject to it.
No gentleman, nor even any burgher who<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt777" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt777_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 has stock, will submit to this degradation. This tax, therefore, not
only hinders the stock which accumulates upon the land from being
employed in its improvement, but drives away all other stock from it.
The ancient tenths and fifteenths,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt778" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt778_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 so usual in England in former times, seem, so far as they affected the
land, to have been taxes of the same nature with the taille.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1110">Under all these discouragements, little improvement could be expected from the occupiers of land. That order of people, with all<span class="type-margin"><span>Even under the best laws the farmer is at a disadvantage in improving,</span></span>
 the liberty and security which law can give, must always improve under
great disadvantages. The farmer compared with the proprietor, is as a
merchant who trades with borrowed money compared with one who trades
with his own. The stock of both may improve, but that of the one, with
only equal good conduct, must always improve more slowly than that of
the other, on account of the large share of the profits which is
consumed by the interest of the loan. The lands cultivated by the farmer
 must, in the same manner, with only equal <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>370<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 good conduct, be improved more slowly than those cultivated by the
proprietor; on account of the large share of the produce which is
consumed in the rent, and which, had the farmer been proprietor, he
might have employed in the further improvement of the land.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt779" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt779_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The station of a farmer besides is, from the nature of things, inferior
 to that of a proprietor. Through the greater part of Europe the
yeomanry are regarded as an inferior rank of people, even to the better
sort of tradesmen and mechanics, and in all parts of Europe to the great
 merchants and master manufacturers. It can seldom happen, therefore,
that a man of any considerable stock should quit the superior, in order
to place himself in an inferior station. Even in the present state of
Europe, therefore, little stock is likely to go from any other
profession to the improvement of land in the way of farming. More does
perhaps in Great Britain than in any other country, though even there
the great stocks which are, in some places, employed in farming, have
generally been acquired by farming, the trade, perhaps, in which of all<span class="type-margin"><span>but large farmers are the principal improvers after small proprietors.</span></span>
 others stock is commonly acquired most slowly. After small proprietors,
 however, rich and great farmers are, in every country, the principal
improvers. There are more such perhaps in England than in any other
European monarchy. In the republican governments of Holland and of Berne
 in Switzerland, the farmers are said to be not inferior to those of
England.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt780" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt780_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1111"><span class="type-margin"><span>The common
prohibition of the export of corn and the restraints on internal trade
in agricultural produce were further discouragements to agriculture.</span></span>The
 ancient policy of Europe was, over and above all this, unfavourable to
the improvement and cultivation of land, whether carried on by the
proprietor or by the farmer; first, by the general prohibition of the
exportation of corn without a special licence, which seems to have been a
 very universal regulation; and secondly, by the restraints which were
laid upon the inland commerce, not only of corn but of almost every
other part of the produce of the farm, by the absurd laws against
engrossers, regraters, and forestallers, and by the privileges of fairs
and markets.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt781" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt781_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 It has already been observed in what manner the prohibition of the
exportation of corn, together with some encouragement given to the
importation of foreign corn, obstructed the cultivation of ancient
Italy, naturally the most fertile country in Europe, and at that time
the seat of the greatest empire in the world.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt782" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt782_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 To what degree such restraints upon the inland commerce of this
commodity, joined to the general prohibition of exportation, must have
discouraged the cultivation of countries less fertile, and less
favourably circumstanced, it is not perhaps very easy to imagine.</p>

<h2 id="lf0206-01_label_848">CHAPTER III: OF THE RISE AND PROGRESS OF CITIES AND TOWNS, AFTER THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE</h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-01_1112">THE inhabitants of cities and towns were, after the fall of the<span class="type-margin"><span>The townsmen were not at first favoured more than the countrymen.</span></span>
 Roman empire, not more favoured than those of the country. They
consisted, indeed, of a very different order of people from the first
inhabitants of the ancient republics of Greece and Italy. These last
were composed chiefly of the proprietors of lands, among whom the public
 territory was originally divided, and who found it convenient to build
their houses in the neighbourhood of one another, and to surround them
with a wall, for the sake of common defence. After the fall of the Roman
 empire, on the contrary, the proprietors of land seem generally to have
 lived in fortified castles on their own estates, and in the midst of
their own tenants and dependants. The towns were chiefly inhabited by
tradesmen and mechanics, who seem in those days to have been of servile,
 or very nearly of servile condition. The privileges which we find
granted by ancient charters to the inhabitants of some of the principal
towns in Europe, sufficiently shew what they were before those grants.
The people to whom it is granted as a privilege, that they might give
away their own daughters in marriage without the consent of their lord,
that upon their death their own children, and not their lord, should
succeed to their goods, and that they might dispose of their own effects
 by will, must, before those grants, have been either altogether, or
very nearly in the same state of villanage with the occupiers of land in
 the country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1113">They seem, indeed, to have been a very poor, mean set of people,<span class="type-margin"><span>They were very nearly of servile condition,</span></span>
 who used to travel about with their goods from place to place, and from
 fair to fair, like the hawkers and pedlars of the present times.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt783" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt783_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 In all the different countries of Europe then, in the same manner as in
 several of the Tartar governments of Asia at present, taxes used to be <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>372<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 levied upon the persons and goods of travellers, when they passed
through certain manors, when they went over certain bridges, when they
carried about their goods from place to place in a fair, when they
erected in it a booth or stall to sell them in. These different taxes
were known in England by the names of passage, pontage, lastage, and
stallage. Sometimes the king, sometimes a great lord, who had, it seems,
 upon some occasions, authority to do this, would grant to particular
traders, to such particularly as lived in their own demesnes, a general
exemption from such taxes. Such traders, though in other respects of
servile, or very nearly of servile condition, were upon this account
called Free-traders. They in return usually paid to their protector a
sort of annual poll-tax. In those days protection was seldom granted
without a valuable consideration, and this tax might, perhaps, be
considered as compensation for what their patrons might lose by their
exemption from other taxes. At first, both those poll-taxes and those
exemptions seem to have been altogether personal, and to have affected
only particular individuals, during either their lives, or the pleasure
of their protectors. In the very imperfect accounts which have been
published from Domesday-book, of several of the towns of England,
mention is frequently made sometimes of the tax which particular
burghers paid, each of them, either to the king, or to some other great
lord, for this sort of protection; and sometimes of the general amount
only of all those taxes.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt784" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt784_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1114"><span class="type-margin"><span>but arrived at liberty much earlier than the country people, acquiring the farm of their town,</span></span>But how servile soever may have been originally the condition of the inhabitants of the<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt785" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt785_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 towns, it appears evidently, that they arrived at liberty and
independency much earlier than the occupiers of land in the country.
That part of the king’s revenue which arose from such poll-taxes in any
particular town, used commonly to be let in farm, during a term of years
 for a rent certain, sometimes to the sheriff of the county, and
sometimes to other persons. The burghers themselves frequently got
credit enough to be admitted to farm the revenues of this sort which
arose out of their own town, they becoming jointly and severally
answerable for the whole rent.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt786" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt786_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> To let a farm in this manner <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>373<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 was quite agreeable to the usual œconomy of, I believe, the sovereigns
of all the different countries of Europe; who used frequently to let
whole manors to all the tenants of those manors, they becoming jointly
and severally answerable for the whole rent;<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt787" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt787_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 but in return being allowed to collect it in their own way, and to pay
it into the king’s exchequer by the hands of their own bailiff, and
being thus altogether freed from the insolence of the king’s officers; a
 circumstance in those days regarded as of the greatest importance.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1115">At first, the farm of the town was probably let to the burghers, in<span class="type-margin"><span>first for a term of years and afterwards in perpetuity,</span></span>
 the same manner as it had been to other farmers, for a term of years
only. In process of time, however, it seems to have become the general
practice to grant it to them in fee, that is for ever, reserving a rent
certain never afterwards to be augmented. The payment having thus become
 perpetual, the exemptions, in return for which it was made, naturally
became perpetual too. Those exemptions, therefore, ceased to be
personal, and could not afterwards be considered as belonging to
individuals as individuals, but as burghers of a particular burgh,
which, upon this account, was called a Free burgh, for the same reason
that they had been called Free-burghers or Free-traders.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1116">Along with this grant, the important privileges above mentioned,<span class="type-margin"><span>as well as other privileges equivalent to freedom,</span></span>
 that they might give away their own daughters in marriage, that their
children should succeed to them, and that they might dispose of their
own effects by will, were generally bestowed upon the burghers of the
town to whom it was given. Whether such privileges had before been
usually granted along with the freedom of trade, to particular burghers,
 as individuals, I know not. I reckon it not improbable that they were,
though I cannot produce any direct evidence of it. But however this may
have been, the principal attributes of villanage and slavery being thus
taken away from them, they now, at least, became really free in our
present sense of the word Freedom.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1117">Nor was this all. They were generally at the same time erected<span class="type-margin"><span>and a government of their own.</span></span>
 into a commonalty or corporation, with the privilege of having
magistrates and a town-council of their own, of making bye-laws for
their own government, of building walls for their own defence, and of
reducing all their inhabitants under a sort of military discipline, by
obliging them to watch and ward; that is, as anciently understood, to
guard and defend those walls against all attacks and surprises by night <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>374<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 as well as by day. In England they were generally exempted from suit to
 the hundred and county courts; and all such pleas as should arise among
 them, the pleas of the crown excepted, were left to the decision of
their own magistrates. In other countries much greater and more
extensive jurisdictions were frequently granted to them.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt788" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt788_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1118"><span class="type-margin"><span>It seems strange that sovereigns should have abandoned the prospect of increased revenue and have erected independent republics,</span></span>It
 might, probably, be necessary to grant to such towns as were admitted
to farm their own revenues, some sort of compulsive jurisdiction to
oblige their own citizens to make payment. In those disorderly times it
might have been extremely inconvenient to have left them to seek this
sort of justice from any other tribunal. But it must seem extraordinary
that the sovereigns of all the different countries of Europe, should
have exchanged in this manner for a rent certain, never more to be
augmented, that branch of their revenue, which was, perhaps, of all
others the most likely to be improved by the natural course of things,
without either expence or attention of their own:<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt789" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt789_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 and that they should, besides, have in this manner voluntarily erected a
 sort of independent republics in the heart of their own dominions.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1119"><span class="type-margin"><span>but the towns were the natural allies of the sovereign against the lords.</span></span>In
 order to understand this, it must be remembered, that in those days the
 sovereign of perhaps no country in Europe was able to protect, through
the whole extent of his dominions, the weaker part of his subjects from
the oppression of the great lords. Those whom the law could not protect,
 and who were not strong enough to defend themselves, were obliged
either to have recourse to the protection of some great lord, and in
order to obtain it to become either his slaves or vassals; or to enter
into a league of mutual defence for the common protection of one
another. The inhabitants of cities and burghs, considered as single
individuals, had no power to defend themselves; but by entering into a
league of mutual defence with their neighbours, they were capable of
making no contemptible resistance. The lords despised the burghers, whom
 they considered not only as of a different order, but as a parcel of
emancipated slaves, almost of a different species from themselves. The
wealth of the burghers never failed to provoke their envy and
indignation, and they plundered them upon every occasion without mercy
or remorse. The burghers naturally hated and feared the lords. The king
hated and feared them too; but <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>375<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 though perhaps he might despise, he had no reason either to hate or
fear the burghers. Mutual interest, therefore, disposed them to support
the king, and the king to support them against the lords. They were the
enemies of his enemies, and it was his interest to render them as secure
 and independent of those enemies as he could. By granting them
magistrates of their own, the privilege of making bye-laws for their own
 government, that of building walls for their own defence, and that of
reducing all their inhabitants under a sort of military discipline, he
gave them all the means of security and independency of the barons which
 it was in his power to bestow. Without the establishment of some
regular government of this kind, without some authority to compel their
inhabitants to act according to some certain plan or system, no
voluntary league of mutual defence could either have afforded them any
permanent security, or have enabled them to give the king any
considerable support. By granting them the farm of their town in fee, he
 took away from those whom he wished to have for his friends, and, if
one may say so, for his allies, all ground of jealousy and suspicion
that he was ever afterwards to oppress them, either by raising the farm
rent of their town, or by granting it to some other farmer.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1120">The princes who lived upon the worst terms with their barons, seem<span class="type-margin"><span>The sovereigns who quarrelled most with the barons were the most liberal to the towns.</span></span>
 accordingly to have been the most liberal in grants of this kind to
their burghs. King John of England, for example, appears to have been a
most munificent benefactor to his towns.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt790" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt790_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Philip the First of France lost all authority over his barons. Towards
the end of his reign, his son Lewis, known afterwards by the name of
Lewis the Fat, consulted, according to Father Daniel, with the bishops
of the royal demesnes, concerning the most proper means of restraining
the violence of the great lords.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt791" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt791_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 Their advice consisted of two different proposals. One was to erect a
new order of jurisdiction by establishing magistrates and a town council
 in every considerable town of his demesnes. The other was to form a new
 militia, by making the inhabitants of those towns, under the command of
 their own magistrates, march out upon proper occasions to the
assistance of the king. It is from this period, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>376<span class="bracket">]</span></span> according to the French antiquarians,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt792" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt792_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 that we are to date the institution of the magistrates and councils of
cities in France. It was during the unprosperous reigns of the princes
of the house of Suabia that the greater part of the free towns of
Germany received the first grants of their privileges, and that the
famous Hanseatic league first became formidable.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt793" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt793_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1121"><span class="type-margin"><span>The city militia was often able to overpower the neighbouring lords, as in Italy and Switzerland.</span></span>The
 militia of the cities seems, in those times, not to have been inferior
to that of the country, and as they could be more readily assembled upon
 any sudden occasion, they frequently had the advantage in their
disputes with the neighbouring lords. In countries, such as Italy and
Switzerland, in which, on account either of their distance from the
principal seat of government, of the natural strength of the country
itself, or of some other reason, the sovereign came to lose the whole of
 his authority, the cities generally became independent republics, and
conquered all the nobility in their neighbourhood; obliging them to pull
 down their castles in the country, and to live, like other peaceable
inhabitants, in the city. This is the short history of the republic of
Berne, as well as of several other cities in Switzerland. If you except
Venice, for of that city the history is somewhat different, it is the
history of all the considerable Italian republics, of which so great a
number arose and perished, between the end of the twelfth and the
beginning of the sixteenth century.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1122"><span class="type-margin"><span>In France and England the cities could not be taxed without their own consent.</span></span>In
 countries such as France or England, where the authority of the
sovereign, though frequently very low, never was destroyed altogether,
the cities had no opportunity of becoming entirely independent. They
became, however, so considerable, that the sovereign could impose no tax
 upon them, besides the stated farm-rent of the town, without their own
consent. They were, therefore, called upon to send deputies to the
general assembly of the states of the kingdom, where they might join
with the clergy and the barons in granting, upon urgent occasions, some
extraordinary aid to the king. Being generally too more favourable to
his power, their deputies seem, sometimes, to have been employed by him
as a counter-balance in those assemblies to the authority of the great
lords.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt794" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt794_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> Hence the origin of the representation of burghs in the states general of all the great monarchies in Europe.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1123"><span class="type-margin"><span>In
consequence of this greater security of the towns industry flourished
and stock accumulated there earlier than in the country.</span></span>Order
 and good government, and along with them the liberty and security of
individuals, were, in this manner, established in cities, at a <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>377<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 time when the occupiers of land in the country were exposed to every
sort of violence. But men in this defenceless state naturally content
themselves with their necessary subsistence; because to acquire more
might only tempt the injustice of their oppressors. On the contrary,
when they are secure of enjoying the fruits of their industry, they
naturally exert it to better their condition and to acquire not only the
 necessaries, but the conveniencies and elegancies of life. That
industry, therefore, which aims at something more than necessary
subsistence, was established in cities long before it was commonly
practised by the occupiers of land in the country. If in the hands of a
poor cultivator, oppressed with the servitude of villanage, some little
stock should accumulate, he would naturally conceal it with great care
from his master, to whom it would otherwise have belonged, and take the
first opportunity of running away to a town. The law was at that time so
 indulgent to the inhabitants of towns, and so desirous of diminishing
the authority of the lords over those of the country, that if he could
conceal himself there from the pursuit of his lord for a year, he was
free for ever.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt795" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt795_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Whatever stock, therefore, accumulated in the hands of the industrious
part of the inhabitants of the country, naturally took refuge in cities,
 as the only sanctuaries in which it could be secure to the person that
acquired it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1124">The inhabitants of a city, it is true, must always ultimately derive<span class="type-margin"><span>Cities on the sea-coast or on navigable rivers are not dependent on the neighbouring country</span></span>
 their subsistence, and the whole materials and means of their industry,
 from the country. But those of a city, situated near either the
sea-coast or the banks of a navigable river, are not necessarily
confined to derive them from the country in their neighbourhood. They
have a much wider range, and may draw them from the most remote corners
of the world, either in exchange for the manufactured produce of their
own industry, or by performing the office of carriers between distant
countries, and exchanging the produce of one for that of another. A city
 might in this manner grow up to great wealth and splendor, while not
only the country in its neighbourhood, but all those to which it traded,
 were in poverty and wretchedness. Each of those countries, perhaps,
taken singly, could afford it but a small part, either of its
subsistence, or of its employment; but all of them taken together could
afford it both a great subsistence and a great employment. There were,
however, within the narrow circle of the commerce of those times, some
countries that were opulent and industrious. Such was the Greek empire
as long as it subsisted, and that of the Saracens during the reigns of
the Abassides. Such too was Egypt till it was <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>378<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 conquered by the Turks, some part of the coast of Barbary, and all
those provinces of Spain which were under the government of the Moors.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1125"><span class="type-margin"><span>The cities of Italy were the first to grow opulent, being centrally situated and benefited by the crusades.</span></span>The
 cities of Italy seem to have been the first in Europe which were raised
 by commerce to any considerable degree of opulence. Italy lay in the
centre of what was at that time the improved and civilized part of the
world. The crusades too, though, by the great waste of stock and
destruction of inhabitants which they occasioned, they must necessarily
have retarded the progress of the greater part of Europe, were extremely
 favourable to that of some Italian cities. The great armies which
marched from all parts to the conquest of the Holy Land, gave
extraordinary encouragement to the shipping of Venice, Genoa, and Pisa,
sometimes in transporting them thither, and always in supplying them
with provisions. They were the commissaries, if one may say so, of those
 armies; and the most destructive frenzy that ever befel the European
nations,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt796" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt796_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> was a source of opulence to those republics.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1126"><span class="type-margin"><span>The cities imported manufactures and luxuries from richer countries, which were paid for by rude produce.</span></span>The
 inhabitants of trading cities, by importing the improved manufactures
and expensive luxuries of richer countries, afforded some food to the
vanity of the great proprietors, who eagerly purchased them with great
quantities of the rude produce of their own lands. The commerce of a
great part of Europe in those times, accordingly, consisted chiefly in
the exchange of their own rude, for the manufactured produce of more
civilized nations. Thus the wool of England used to be exchanged for the
 wines of France, and the fine cloths of Flanders, in the same manner as
 the corn of<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt797" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt797_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> Poland is at this day exchanged for the wines and brandies of France, and for the silks and velvets of France and Italy.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1127"><span class="type-margin"><span>Demand for such manufactured articles having become considerable, their manufacture was established in the cities.</span></span>A
 taste for the finer and more improved manufactures, was in this manner
introduced by foreign commerce into countries where no such works were
carried on. But when this taste became so general as to occasion a
considerable demand, the merchants, in order to save the expence of
carriage, naturally endeavoured to establish some manufactures of the
same kind in their own country. Hence the origin of the first
manufactures for distant sale that seem to have been established in the
western provinces of Europe, after the fall of the Roman empire.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1128"><span class="type-margin"><span>All countries have some manufactures.</span></span>No
 large country, it must be observed, ever did or could subsist without
some sort of manufactures being carried on in it; and when it is said of
 any such country that it has no manufactures, it must always be
understood of the finer and more improved, or of such as are fit for <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>379<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 distant sale. In every large country, both the clothing and houshold
furniture of the far greater part of the people, are the produce of
their own industry. This is even more universally the case in those poor
 countries which are commonly said to have no manufactures, than in
those rich ones that are said to abound in them. In the latter, you will
 generally find, both in the clothes and houshold furniture of the
lowest rank of people, a much greater proportion of foreign productions
than in the former.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1129">Those manufactures which are fit for distant sale, seem to have been introduced into different countries in two different ways.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1130">Sometimes they have been introduced, in the manner above mentioned,<span class="type-margin"><span>Sometimes manufactures for distant sale are introduced in imitation of foreign manufactures.</span></span>
 by the violent operation, if one may say so, of the stocks of
particular merchants and undertakers, who established them in imitation
of some foreign manufactures of the same kind. Such manufactures,
therefore, are the offspring of foreign commerce, and such seem to have
been the ancient manufactures of silks, velvets, and brocades, which
flourished in Lucca, during<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt798" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt798_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 the thirteenth century. They were banished from thence by the tyranny
of one of Machiavel’s heroes, Castruccio Castracani. In 1310, nine
hundred families were driven out of Lucca, of whom thirty-one retired to
 Venice, and offered to introduce there the silk manufacture.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt799" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt799_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 Their offer was accepted; many privileges were conferred upon them, and
 they began the manufacture with three hundred workmen. Such too seem to
 have been the manufactures of fine cloths that anciently flourished in
Flanders, and which were introduced into England in the beginning of the
 reign of Elizabeth; and such are the present silk manufactures of Lyons
 and Spital-fields. Manufactures introduced in this manner are generally
 employed upon foreign materials, being<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt800" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt800_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 imitations of foreign manufactures. When the Venetian manufacture was
first established, the materials were all brought from Sicily and the
Levant. The more ancient manufacture of Lucca was likewise carried on
with foreign materials. The cultivation of mulberry trees, and the
breeding of silkworms, seem<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt801" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt801_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 not to have been common in the northern parts of Italy before the
sixteenth century. Those arts were not introduced into France till the
reign of Charles IX.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt802" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt802_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a> The manufactures of Flanders <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>380<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 were carried on chiefly with Spanish and English wool. Spanish wool was
 the material, not of the first woollen manufacture of England, but of
the first that was fit for distant sale. More than one half the
materials of the Lyons manufacture is at this day foreign silk; when it
was first established, the whole or very nearly the whole was so. No
part of the materials of the Spital-fields manufacture is ever likely to
 be the produce of England. The seat of such manufactures, as they are
generally introduced by the scheme and project of a few individuals, is
sometimes established in a maritime city, and sometimes in an inland
town, according as their interest, judgment or caprice happen to
determine.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1131"><span class="type-margin"><span>Sometimes they have grown up out of the coarser home manufactures.</span></span>At
 other times manufactures for distant sale grow up naturally, and as it
were of their own accord, by the gradual refinement of those houshold
and coarser manufactures which must at all times be carried on even in
the poorest and rudest countries. Such manufactures are generally
employed upon the materials which the country produces, and they seem
frequently to have been first refined and improved in such inland
countries as were, not indeed at a very great, but at a considerable
distance from the sea coast, and sometimes even from all water carriage.
 An inland country naturally fertile and easily cultivated, produces a
great surplus of provisions beyond what is necessary for maintaining the
 cultivators, and on account of the expence of land carriage, and
inconveniency of river navigation, it may frequently be difficult to
send this surplus abroad. Abundance, therefore, renders provisions
cheap, and encourages a great number of workmen to settle in the
neighbourhood, who find that their industry can there procure them more
of the necessaries and conveniencies of life than in other places. They
work up the materials of manufacture which the land produces, and
exchange their finished work, or what is the same thing the price of it,
 for more materials and provisions. They give a new value to the surplus
 part of the rude produce, by saving the expence of carrying it to the
water side, or to some distant market; and they furnish the cultivators
with something in exchange for it that is either useful or agreeable to
them, upon easier terms than they could have obtained it before. The
cultivators get a better price for their surplus produce, and can
purchase cheaper other conveniencies which they have occasion for. They
are thus both encouraged and enabled to increase this surplus produce by
 a further improvement and better <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>381<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 cultivation of the land; and as the fertility of the land had given
birth to the manufacture, so the progress of the manufacture re-acts
upon the land, and increases still further its fertility. The
manufacturers first supply the neighbourhood, and afterwards, as their
work improves and refines, more distant markets. For though neither the
rude produce, nor even the coarse manufacture, could, without the
greatest difficulty, support the expence of a considerable land
carriage, the refined and improved manufacture easily may. In a small
bulk it frequently contains the price of a great quantity of rude
produce. A piece of fine cloth, for example, which weighs only eighty
pounds, contains in it, the price, not only of eighty pounds weight of
wool, but sometimes of several thousand weight of corn, the maintenance
of the different working people, and of their immediate employers. The
corn, which could with difficulty have been carried abroad in its own
shape, is in this manner virtually exported in that of the complete
manufacture, and may easily be sent to the remotest corners of the
world. In this manner have grown up naturally, and as it were of their
own accord, the manufactures of Leeds, Halifax, Sheffield, Birmingham,
and Wolverhampton. Such manufactures are the offspring of agriculture.
In the modern history of Europe, their extension and improvement have
generally been posterior to those which were the offspring of foreign
commerce. England was noted for the manufacture of fine cloths made of
Spanish wool, more than a century before any of those which now flourish
 in the places above mentioned were fit for foreign sale. The extension
and improvement of these last could not take place but in consequence of
 the extension and improvement of agriculture, the last and greatest
effect of foreign commerce, and of the manufactures immediately
introduced by it, and which I shall now proceed to explain.</p>

<h2 id="lf0206-01_label_869">CHAPTER IV: HOW THE COMMERCE OF THE TOWNS CONTRIBUTED TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE COUNTRY</h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-01_1132"><span class="type-margin"><span>The rise of towns benefited the country,</span></span>THE
 increase and riches of commercial and manufacturing towns, contributed
to the improvement and cultivation of the countries to which they
belonged, in three different ways.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1133"><span class="type-margin"><span>because they afforded (1) already market for its produce,</span></span>First,
 by affording a great and ready market for the rude produce of the
country, they gave encouragement to its cultivation and further
improvement. This benefit was not even confined to the countries in
which they were situated, but extended more or less to all those with
which they had any dealings. To all of them they afforded a market for
some part either of their rude or manufactured produce, and consequently
 gave some encouragement to the industry and improvement of all. Their
own country, however, on account of its neighbourhood, necessarily
derived the greatest benefit from this market. Its rude produce being
charged with less carriage, the traders could pay the growers a better
price for it, and yet afford it as cheap to the consumers as that of
more distant countries.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1134"><span class="type-margin"><span>(2) because merchants bought land in the country and improved it,</span></span>Secondly,
 the wealth acquired by the inhabitants of cities was frequently
employed in purchasing such lands as were to be sold, of which a great
part would frequently be uncultivated. Merchants are commonly ambitious
of becoming country gentlemen, and when they do, they are generally the
best of all improvers. A merchant is accustomed to employ his money
chiefly in profitable projects; whereas a mere country gentleman is
accustomed to employ it chiefly in expence. The one often sees his money
 go from him and return to him again with a profit: the other, when once
 he parts with it, very seldom expects to see any more of it. Those
different habits naturally affect their temper and disposition in every
sort of business. A merchant is commonly a bold; a country gentleman, a
timid undertaker. The one is not afraid to lay out at once a large
capital upon <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>383<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 the improvement of his land, when he has a probable prospect of raising
 the value of it in proportion to the expence. The other, if he has any
capital, which is not always the case, seldom ventures to employ it in
this manner. If he improves at all, it is commonly not with a capital,
but with what he can save out of his annual revenue. Whoever has had the
 fortune to live in a mercantile town situated in an unimproved country,
 must have frequently observed how much more spirited the operations of
merchants were in this way, than those of mere country gentlemen.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt803" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt803_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The habits, besides, of order, œconomy and attention, to which
mercantile business naturally forms a merchant, render him much fitter
to execute, with profit and success, any project of improvement.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1135">Thirdly, and lastly, commerce and manufactures gradually introduced<span class="type-margin"><span>and (3) because order and good government were introduced.</span></span>
 order and good government, and with them, the liberty and security of
individuals, among the inhabitants of the country, who had before lived
almost in a continual state of war with their neighbours, and of servile
 dependency upon their superiors. This, though it has been the least
observed, is by far the most important of all their effects. Mr. Hume<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt804" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt804_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> is the only writer who, so far as I know, has hitherto taken notice of it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1136">In a country which has neither foreign commerce, nor any of the<span class="type-margin"><span>Before foreign commerce and fine manufactures are introduced great proprietors are surrounded by bands of retainers,</span></span>
 finer manufactures, a great proprietor, having nothing for which he can
 exchange the greater part of the produce of his lands which is over and
 above the maintenance of the cultivators, consumes the whole in rustic
hospitality at home. If this surplus produce is sufficient to maintain a
 hundred or a thousand men, he can make use of it in no other way than
by maintaining a hundred or a thousand men. He is at all times,
therefore, surrounded with a multitude of retainers and dependants, who
having no equivalent to give in return for their maintenance, but being
fed entirely by his bounty, must obey him, for the same reason that
soldiers must obey the prince who pays them. Before the extension of
commerce and manufactures in Europe, the hospitality of the rich and the
 great, from the sovereign down to the smallest baron, exceeded every
thing which in the present times we can easily form a notion of.
Westminster hall was the dining-room of William Rufus, and might
frequently, perhaps, not be too large for his company. It was reckoned a
 piece of magnificence in Thomas Becket, that he strowed the floor of
his hall with clean hay or rushes in the season, in order that the
knights and squires, who could not get seats, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>384<span class="bracket">]</span></span> might not spoil their fine clothes when they sat down on the floor to eat their dinner.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt805" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt805_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The great earl of Warwick is said to have entertained every day at his
different manors, thirty thousand people; and though the number here may
 have been exaggerated, it must, however, have been very great to admit
of such exaggeration.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt806" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt806_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 A hospitality nearly of the same kind was exercised not many years ago
in many different parts of the highlands of Scotland. It seems to be
common in all nations to whom commerce and manufactures are little
known. I have seen, says Doctor Pocock, an Arabian chief dine in the
streets of a town where he had come to sell his cattle, and invite all
passengers, even common beggars, to sit down with him and partake of his
 banquet.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt807" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt807_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1137"><span class="type-margin"><span>and tenants at will were just as dependent as retainers.</span></span>The
 occupiers of land were in every respect as dependent upon the great
proprietor as his retainers. Even such of them as were not in a state of
 villanage, were tenants at will, who paid a rent in no respect
equivalent to the subsistence which the land afforded them. A crown,
half a crown, a sheep, a lamb, was some years ago in the highlands of
Scotland a common rent for lands which maintained a family. In some
places it is so at this day; nor will money at present purchase a
greater quantity of commodities there than in other places. In a country
 where the surplus produce of a large estate must be consumed upon the
estate itself, it will frequently be more convenient for the proprietor,
 that part of it be consumed at a distance from his own house, provided
they who consume it are as dependent upon him as either his retainers or
 his menial servants. He is thereby saved from the embarrassment of
either too large a company or too large a family. A tenant at will, who
possesses land sufficient to maintain his family for little more than a
quit-rent, is as dependent upon the proprietor as any servant or
retainer whatever, and must obey him with as little reserve. Such a
proprietor, as he feeds his servants and retainers at his own house, so
he feeds his tenants at their houses. The subsistence of both is derived
 from his bounty, and its continuance depends upon his good pleasure.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1138"><span class="type-margin"><span>The power of the ancient barons was founded on this.</span></span>Upon
 the authority which the great proprietors necessarily had in such a
state of things over their tenants and retainers, was founded the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>385<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 power of the ancient barons. They necessarily became the judges in
peace, and the leaders in war, of all who dwelt upon their estates. They
 could maintain order and execute the law within their respective
demesnes, because each of them could there turn the whole force of all
the inhabitants against the injustice of any one. No other person had
sufficient authority to do this. The king in particular had not. In
those ancient times he was little more than the greatest proprietor in
his dominions, to whom, for the sake of common defence against their
common enemies, the other great proprietors paid certain respects. To
have enforced payment of a small debt within the lands of a great
proprietor, where all the inhabitants were armed and accustomed to stand
 by one another, would have cost the king, had he attempted it by his
own authority, almost the same effort as to extinguish a civil war. He
was, therefore, obliged to abandon the administration of justice through
 the greater part of the country, to those who were capable of
administering it; and for the same reason to leave the command of the
country militia to those whom that militia would obey.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1139">It is a mistake to imagine that those territorial jurisdictions took their<span class="type-margin"><span>It was anterior to and independent of the feudal law.</span></span>
 origin from the feudal law. Not only the highest jurisdictions both
civil and criminal, but the power of levying troops, of coining money,
and even that of making bye-laws for the government of their own people,
 were all rights possessed allodially by the great proprietors of land
several centuries before even the name of the feudal law was known in
Europe. The authority and jurisdiction of the Saxon lords in England,
appear<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt808" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt808_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 to have been as great before the conquest, as that of any of the Norman
 lords after it. But the feudal law is not supposed to have become the
common law of England till after the conquest.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt809" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt809_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 That the most extensive authority and jurisdictions were possessed by
the great lords in France allodially, long before the feudal law was
introduced into that country, is a matter of fact that admits of no
doubt. That authority and those jurisdictions all necessarily flowed
from the state of property and manners just now described. Without
remounting to the remote antiquities of either the French or English
monarchies, we may find in much later times many proofs that such
effects must always flow from such causes. It is not thirty years ago
since Mr. Cameron of Lochiel, a gentleman of Lochabar in Scotland,
without any legal warrant whatever, not being what was then called a
lord of regality, nor even a tenant in chief, but a vassal of the duke
of Argyle, and without being so much as a justice of peace, used,
notwithstanding, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>386<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 to exercise the highest criminal jurisdiction over his own people. He
is said to have done so with great equity, though without any of the
formalities of justice; and it is not improbable that the state of that
part of the country at that time made it necessary for him to assume
this authority in order to maintain the public peace. That gentleman,
whose rent never exceeded five hundred pounds a year, carried, in 1745,
eight hundred of his own people into the rebellion with him.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt810" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt810_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1140"><span class="type-margin"><span>It was moderated by the feudal law,</span></span>The
 introduction of the feudal law, so far from extending, may be regarded
as an attempt to moderate the authority of the great allodial lords.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt811" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt811_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 It established a regular subordination, accompanied with a long train
of services and duties, from the king down to the smallest proprietor.
During the minority of the proprietor, the rent, together with the
management of his lands, fell into the hands of his immediate superior,
and, consequently, those of all great proprietors into the hands of the
king, who was charged with the maintenance and education of the pupil,
and who, from his authority as guardian, was supposed to have a right of
 disposing of him in marriage, provided it was in a manner not
unsuitable to his rank. But though this institution necessarily tended
to strengthen the authority of the king, and to weaken that of the great
 proprietors, it could not do either sufficiently for establishing order
 and good government among the inhabitants of the country; because it
could not alter sufficiently that state of property and manners from
which the disorders arose. The authority of government still continued
to be, as before, too weak in the head and too strong in the inferior
members, and the excessive strength of the inferior members was the
cause of the weakness of the head. After the institution of feudal
subordination, the king was as incapable of restraining the violence of
the great lords as before. They still continued to make war according to
 their own discretion, almost continually upon one another, and very
frequently upon the king; and the open country still continued to be a
scene of violence, rapine, and disorder.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1141"><span class="type-margin"><span>and undermined by foreign commerce.</span></span>But
 what all the violence of the feudal institutions could never have
effected, the silent and insensible operation of foreign commerce and
manufactures gradually brought about. These gradually furnished the
great proprietors with something for which they could exchange the whole
 surplus produce of their lands, and which they could consume themselves
 without sharing it either with tenants or retainers. All for <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>387<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 ourselves, and nothing for other people, seems, in every age of the
world, to have been the vile maxim of the masters of mankind. As soon,
therefore, as they could find a method of consuming the whole value of
their rents themselves, they had no disposition to share them with any
other persons. For a pair of diamond buckles perhaps, or for something
as frivolous and useless, they exchanged the maintenance, or what is the
 same thing, the price of the maintenance of a thousand men for a year,
and with it the whole weight and authority which it could give them. The
 buckles, however, were to be all their own, and no other human creature
 was to have any share of them; whereas in the more ancient method of
expence they must have shared with at least a thousand people. With the
judges that were to determine the preference, this difference was
perfectly decisive; and thus, for the gratification of the most
childish, the meanest and the most sordid of all vanities, they
gradually bartered their whole power and authority.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt812" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt812_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1142">In a country where there is no foreign commerce, nor any of the<span class="type-margin"><span>At
 present a rich man maintains in all as many persons as an ancient
baron, but he contributes only a small portion of the maintenance of
each person.</span></span> finer manufactures, a man of ten thousand a
year cannot well employ his revenue in any other way than in
maintaining, perhaps, a thousand families, who are all of them
necessarily at his command. In the present state of Europe, a man of ten
 thousand a year can spend his whole revenue, and he generally does so,
without directly maintaining twenty people, or being able to command
more than ten footmen not worth the commanding. Indirectly, perhaps, he
maintains as great or even a greater number of people than he could have
 done by the ancient method of expence. For though the quantity of
precious productions for which he exchanges his whole revenue be very
small, the number of workmen employed in collecting and preparing it,
must necessarily have been very great. Its great price generally arises
from the wages of their labour, and the profits of all their immediate
employers. By paying that price he indirectly pays all those wages and
profits, and thus indirectly contributes to the maintenance of all the
workmen and their employers. He generally contributes, however, but a
very small proportion to that of each, to very few perhaps a tenth, to
many not a hundredth, and to some not a thousandth, nor even a ten
thousandth part of their whole annual maintenance. Though he
contributes, therefore, to the maintenance of them all, they are all
more or less independent of him, because generally they can all be
maintained without him.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1143">When the great proprietors of land spend their rents in maintaining <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>388<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 their tenants and retainers, each of them maintains entirely all his
own tenants and all his own retainers. But when they spend them in
maintaining tradesmen and artificers, they may, all of them taken
together, perhaps, maintain as great, or, on account of the waste which
attends rustic hospitality, a greater number of people than before. Each
 of them, however, taken singly, contributes often but a very small
share to the maintenance of any individual of this greater number. Each
tradesman or artificer derives his subsistence from the employment, not
of one, but of a hundred or a thousand different customers. Though in
some measure obliged to them all, therefore, he is not absolutely
dependent upon any one of them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1144"><span class="type-margin"><span>To meet their
 new expenses the great proprietors dismissed their retainers and their
unnecessary tenants, and gave the remaining tenants long leases,</span></span>The
 personal expence of the great proprietors having in this manner
gradually increased, it was impossible that the number of their
retainers should not as gradually diminish, till they were at last
dismissed altogether. The same cause gradually led them to dismiss the
unnecessary part of their tenants. Farms were enlarged, and the
occupiers of land, notwithstanding the complaints of depopulation,
reduced to the number necessary for cultivating it, according to the
imperfect state of cultivation and improvement in those times. By the
removal of the unnecessary mouths, and by exacting from the farmer the
full value of the farm, a greater surplus, or what is the same thing,
the price of a greater surplus, was obtained for the proprietor, which
the merchants and manufacturers soon furnished him with a method of
spending upon his own person in the same manner as he had done the rest.
 The same cause continuing to operate, he was desirous to raise his
rents above what his lands, in the actual state of their improvement,
could afford. His tenants could agree to this upon one condition only,
that they should be secured in their possession, for such a term of
years as might give them time to recover with profit whatever they
should lay out in the further improvement of the land. The expensive
vanity of the landlord made him willing to accept of this condition; and
 hence the origin of long leases.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1145"><span class="type-margin"><span>thus making them independent.</span></span>Even
 a tenant at will, who pays the full value of the land, is not
altogether dependent upon the landlord. The pecuniary advantages which
they receive from one another, are mutual and equal, and such a tenant
will expose neither his life nor his fortune in the service of the
proprietor. But if he has a lease for a long term of years, he is
altogether independent; and his landlord must not expect from him even
the most trifling service beyond what is either expressly stipulated in
the lease, or imposed upon him by the common and known law of the
country.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>389<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1146">The tenants having in this manner become independent, and the<span class="type-margin"><span>The great proprietors thus became insignificant.</span></span>
 retainers being dismissed, the great proprietors were no longer capable
 of interrupting the regular execution of justice, or of disturbing the
peace of the country. Having sold their birth-right, not like Esau for a
 mess of pottage in time of hunger and necessity, but in the wantonness
of plenty, for trinkets and baubles, fitter to be the play-things of
children than the serious pursuits of men, they became as insignificant
as any substantial burgher or tradesman in a city. A regular government
was established in the country as well as in the city, nobody having
sufficient power to disturb its operations in the one, any more than in
the other.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1147">It does not, perhaps, relate to the present subject, but I cannot help<span class="type-margin"><span>Old families are rare in commercial countries.</span></span>
 remarking it, that very old families, such as have possessed some
considerable estate from father to son for many successive generations,
are very rare in commercial countries. In countries which have little
commerce, on the contrary, such as Wales or the highlands of Scotland,
they are very common. The Arabian histories seem to be all full of
genealogies, and there is a history written by a Tartar Khan, which has
been translated into several European languages, and which contains
scarce any thing else;<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt813" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt813_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 a proof that ancient families are very common among those nations. In
countries where a rich man can spend his revenue in no other way than by
 maintaining as many people as it can maintain, he is not apt to run
out, and his benevolence it seems is seldom so violent as to attempt to
maintain more than he can afford. But where he can spend the greatest
revenue upon his own person, he frequently has no bounds to his expence,
 because he frequently has no bounds to his vanity, or to his affection
for his own person. In commercial countries, therefore, riches, in spite
 of the most violent regulations of law to prevent their dissipation,
very seldom remain long in the same family. Among simple nations, on the
 contrary, they frequently do without any regulations of law: for among
nations of shepherds, such as the Tartars and Arabs, the consumable
nature of their property necessarily renders all such regulations
impossible.</p>

 in this manner brought about by two different orders of people, who had
 not the least intention to serve the public. To gratify the most

 merchants and artificers, much less ridiculous, acted merely from a
view to their own interest, and in pursuit of their own pedlar principle
 of turning a penny wherever a penny was to be got. Neither of them had
either knowledge or foresight of that great revolution which the folly
of the one, and the industry of the other, was gradually bringing about.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1149"><span class="type-margin"><span>and commerce and manufactures became the cause of the improvement of the country.</span></span>It
 is thus that through the greater part of Europe the commerce and

 In Europe the law of primogeniture, and perpetuities of different
kinds, prevent the division of great estates, and thereby hinder the
multiplication of small proprietors. A small proprietor, however, who
knows every part of his little territory, who<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt815" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt815_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> views it all with<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt816" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt816_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 the affection which property, especially small property, naturally
inspires, and who upon that account takes pleasure not only in
cultivating but in adorning it, is generally of all improvers the most
industrious, the most intelligent, and the most successful.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt817" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt817_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 The same regulations, besides, keep so much land out of the market,
that there are always more capitals to buy than there is land to sell,
so that what is sold always sells at a monopoly price. The rent never
pays the interest of the purchase-money, and is besides burdened with
repairs and other occasional charges, to which the interest of money is
not liable. To purchase land is every-where in Europe a most
unprofitable employment of a small capital. For the sake of the superior
 security, indeed, a man of moderate circumstances, when he retires from
 business, will sometimes chuse to lay out his little capital in land. A
 man of profession too, whose revenue is derived from another source,
often loves to secure his savings in the same way. But a young man, who,
 instead of applying to trade or to some profession, should employ a
capital of two or three thousand pounds in the purchase and cultivation
of a small piece of land, might indeed expect <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>391<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 to live very happily, and very independently, but must bid adieu, for
ever, to all hope of either great fortune or great illustration, which
by a different employment of his stock he might have had the same chance
 of acquiring with other people. Such a person too, though he cannot
aspire at being a proprietor, will often disdain to be a farmer. The
small quantity of land, therefore, which is brought to market, and the
high price of what is brought thither,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt818" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt818_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 prevents a great number of capitals from being employed in its
cultivation and improvement which would otherwise have taken that
direction. In North America, on the contrary, fifty or sixty pounds is
often found a sufficient stock to begin a plantation with. The purchase
and improvement of uncultivated land, is there the most profitable
employment of the smallest as well as of the greatest capitals, and the
most direct road to all the fortune and illustration which can be
acquired in that country. Such land, indeed, is in North America to be
had almost for nothing, or at a price much below the value of the
natural produce; a thing impossible in Europe, or, indeed, in any
country where all lands have long been private property. If landed
estates, however, were divided equally among all the children, upon the
death of any proprietor who left a numerous family, the estate would
generally be sold. So much land would come to market, that it could no
longer sell at a monopoly price. The free rent of the land would go
nearer to pay the interest of the purchase-money, and a small capital
might be employed in purchasing land as profitably as in any other way.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1151">England, on account of the natural fertility of the soil, of the great<span class="type-margin"><span>and the slow progress of England in agriculture in spite of favours accorded to it</span></span> extent of the<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt819" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt819_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 sea-coast in proportion to that of the whole country, and of the many
navigable rivers which run through it, and afford the conveniency of
water carriage to some of the most inland parts of it, is perhaps as
well fitted by nature as any large country in Europe, to be the seat of
foreign commerce, of manufactures for distant sale, and of all the
improvements which these can occasion. From the beginning of the reign
of Elizabeth too, the English legislature has been peculiarly attentive
to the interests of commerce and manufactures, and in reality there is
no country in Europe, Holland itself not excepted, of which the law is,
upon the whole, more favourable to this sort of industry. Commerce and
manufactures have accordingly been continually advancing during all this
 period. The cultivation and improvement of the country has, no doubt,
been gradually advancing too: But it seems to have followed slowly, and
at a distance, the more rapid progress of commerce and manufactures. The
 greater part of the country must <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>392<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 probably have been cultivated before the reign of Elizabeth; and a very
 great part of it still remains uncultivated, and the cultivation of the
 far greater part, much inferior to what it might be. The law of
England, however, favours agriculture not only indirectly by the
protection of commerce, but by several direct encouragements. Except in
times of scarcity, the exportation of corn is not only free, but
encouraged by a bounty. In times of moderate plenty, the importation of
foreign corn is loaded with duties that amount to a prohibition. The
importation of live cattle, except from Ireland, is prohibited at all
times,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt820" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt820_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> and it is but of late that it was permitted from thence.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt821" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt821_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 Those who cultivate the land, therefore, have a monopoly against their
countrymen for the two greatest and most important articles of land
produce, bread and butcher’s meat. These encouragements, though at
bottom, perhaps, as I shall endeavour to show hereafter,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt822" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt822_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 altogether illusory, sufficiently demonstrate at least the good
intention of the legislature to favour agriculture. But what is of much
more importance than all of them, the yeomanry of England are rendered
as secure, as independent, and as respectable as law can make them. No
country, therefore, in which the right of primogeniture takes place,
which pays tithes, and where perpetuities, though contrary to the spirit
 of the law, are admitted in some cases, can give more encouragement to
agriculture than England. Such, however, notwithstanding, is the state
of its cultivation. What would it have been, had the law given no direct
 encouragement to agriculture besides what arises indirectly from the
progress of commerce, and had left the yeomanry in the same condition as
 in most other countries of Europe? It is now more than two hundred
years since the beginning of the reign of Elizabeth, a period as long as
 the course of human prosperity usually endures.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1152"><span class="type-margin"><span>and the still slower progress of France,</span></span>France
 seems to have had a considerable share of foreign commerce near a
century before England was distinguished as a commercial country. The
marine of France was considerable, according to the notions of the
times, before the expedition of Charles the VIIIth to Naples.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt823" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt823_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> The cultivation and improvement of France, however, is, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>393<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 upon the whole, inferior to that of England. The law of the country has
 never given the same direct encouragement to agriculture.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1153">The foreign commerce of Spain and Portugal to the other parts of<span class="type-margin"><span>Spain and Portugal.</span></span>
 Europe, though chiefly carried on in foreign ships, is very
considerable. That to their colonies is carried on in their own, and is
much greater, on account of the great riches and extent of those
colonies. But it has never introduced any considerable manufactures for
distant sale into either of those countries, and the greater part of
both still remains uncultivated. The foreign commerce of Portugal is of
older standing than that of any great country in Europe, except Italy.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1154">Italy is the only great country of Europe which seems to have been<span class="type-margin"><span>Italy alone was improved throughout by foreign commerce and exported manufactures.</span></span>
 cultivated and improved in every part, by means of foreign commerce and
 manufactures for distant sale. Before the invasion of Charles the
VIIIth, Italy according to Guicciardin,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt824" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt824_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 was cultivated not less in the most mountainous and barren parts of the
 country, than in the plainest and most fertile. The advantageous
situation of the country, and the great number of independent states
which at that time subsisted in it, probably contributed not a little to
 this general cultivation. It is not impossible too, notwithstanding
this general expression of one of the most judicious and reserved of
modern historians, that Italy was not at that time better cultivated
than England is at present.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1155">The capital, however, that is acquired to any country by commerce<span class="type-margin"><span>The national capital acquired by commerce and manufactures is an uncertain possession till realised in the improvement of land</span></span>
 and manufactures, is all a very precarious and uncertain possession,
till some part of it has been secured and realized in the cultivation
and improvement of its lands. A merchant, it has been said very
properly, is not necessarily the citizen of any particular country. It
is in a great measure indifferent to him from what place he carries on
his trade; and a very trifling disgust will make him remove his capital,
 and together with it all the industry which it supports, from one
country to another. No part of it can be said to belong to any
particular country, till it has been spread as it were over the face of
that country, either in buildings, or in the lasting improvement of
lands. No vestige now remains of the great wealth, said to have been
possessed by the greater part of the Hans towns, except in the obscure
histories of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. It is even
uncertain where some <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>394<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of them were situated or to what towns in Europe the Latin names given
to some of them belong. But though the misfortunes of Italy in the end
of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth centuries greatly
diminished the commerce and manufactures of the cities of Lombardy and
Tuscany, those countries still continue to be among the most populous
and best cultivated in Europe. The civil wars of Flanders, and the
Spanish government which succeeded them, chased away the great commerce
of Antwerp, Ghent, and Bruges. But Flanders still continues to be one of
 the richest, best cultivated, and most populous provinces of Europe.
The ordinary revolutions of war and government easily dry up the sources
 of that wealth which arises from commerce only. That which arises from
the more solid improvements of agriculture, is much more durable, and
cannot be destroyed but by those more violent convulsions occasioned by
the depredations of hostile and barbarous nations continued for a
century or two together; such as those that happened for some time
before and after the fall of the Roman empire in the western provinces
of Europe.</p>

<div id="lf0206-01_div_050" class="type-chapter">
<h2 id="lf0206-01_label_894">CHAPTER I: OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE COMMERCIAL OR MERCANTILE SYSTEM</h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-01_1158"><span class="type-margin"><span>Wealth and money in common language are considered synonymous.</span></span>THAT
 wealth consists in money, or in gold and silver, is a popular notion
which naturally arises from the double function of money, as the
instrument of commerce, and as the measure of value. In consequence of
its being the instrument of commerce, when we have money we can more
readily obtain whatever else we have occasion for, than by means of any
other commodity. The great affair, we always find, is to get money. When
 that is obtained, there is no difficulty in making any subsequent
purchase. In consequence of its being the measure of value, we estimate
that of all other commodities by the quantity of money which they will
exchange for. We say of a rich man that he is worth a great deal, and of
 a poor man that he is worth very little money. A frugal man, or a man
eager to be rich, is said to love money; and a careless, a generous, or a
 profuse man, is said to be indifferent about it. To grow rich is to get
 money; and wealth and money, in short, are, in common language,
considered as in every respect synonymous.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1159"><span class="type-margin"><span>Similarly the Tartars thought wealth consisted of cattle.</span></span>A
 rich country, in the same manner as a rich man, is supposed to be a
country abounding in money; and to heap up gold and silver in any
country is supposed to be the readiest way to enrich it. For some time
after the discovery of America, the first enquiry of the Spaniards, when
 they arrived upon any unknown coast, used to be, if there was any gold
or silver to be found in the neighbourhood? By the information which
they received, they judged whether it was worth while to make a
settlement there, or if the country was worth the conquering. Plano
Carpino, a monk sent ambassador from the king of France to one of the
sons of the famous Gengis Khan, says that the Tartars used frequently to
 ask him, if there was plenty of sheep and oxen in the kingdom of
France?<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt826" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt826_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> Their enquiry had the same object with that of the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>397<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 Spaniards. They wanted to know if the country was rich enough to be
worth the conquering. Among the Tartars, as among all other nations of
shepherds, who are generally ignorant of the use of money, cattle are
the instruments of commerce and the measures of value. Wealth,
therefore, according to them, consisted in cattle, as according to the
Spaniards it consisted in gold and silver. Of the two, the Tartar
notion, perhaps, was the nearest to the truth.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1160">Mr. Locke remarks a distinction between money and other moveable<span class="type-margin"><span>Locke thought gold and silver the most substantial part of the wealth of a nation.</span></span>
 goods. All other moveable goods, he says, are of so consumable a nature
 that the wealth which consists in them cannot be much depended on, and a
 nation which abounds in them one year may, without any exportation, but
 merely by their own waste and extravagance, be in great want of them
the next. Money, on the contrary, is a steady friend, which, though it
may travel about from hand to hand, yet if it can be kept from going out
 of the country, is not very liable to be wasted and consumed. Gold and
silver, therefore, are, according to him, the most solid and substantial
 part of the moveable wealth of a nation, and to multiply those metals
ought, he thinks, upon that account, to be the great object of its
political œconomy.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt827" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt827_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1161">Others admit that if a nation could be separated from all the world,<span class="type-margin"><span>Others say that it is necessary to have much money in order to maintain fleets and armies abroad.</span></span>
 it would be of no consequence how much, or how little money circulated
in it. The consumable goods which were circulated by means of this
money, would only be exchanged for a greater or a smaller number of
pieces; but the real wealth or poverty of the country, they allow, would
 depend altogether upon the abundance or scarcity of those consumable
goods. But it is otherwise, they think, with countries which have
connections with foreign nations, and which are obliged to carry on
foreign wars, and to maintain fleets and armies in distant countries.
This, they say, cannot be done, but by sending abroad money to pay them
with; and a nation cannot send much money abroad, unless it has a good
deal at home. Every such nation, therefore, must endeavour in time of
peace to accumulate gold and silver, that, when occasion requires, it
may have wherewithal to carry on foreign wars.</p>

<p id="Smith_0206-01_1162"><span class="type-margin"><span>So all European nations have tried to accumulate gold and silver.</span></span>In
 consequence of these popular notions, all the different nations of
Europe have studied, though to little purpose, every possible means of
accumulating gold and silver in their respective countries. Spain and
Portugal, the proprietors of the principal mines which supply Europe
with those metals, have either prohibited their exportation under the
severest penalties, or subjected it to a considerable duty.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt828" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt828_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> The like prohibition seems anciently to have made a part of the policy of most other European nations.<span class="type-margin"><span>At first by a prohibition of exportation,</span></span> It is even to be found, where we should least of all expect<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt829" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt829_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> to find it, in some old Scotch acts of parliament, which forbid under heavy penalties the carrying gold or silver <span class="ital">forth of the kingdom.</span><a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt830" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt830_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> The like policy anciently took place both in France and England.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1163"><span class="type-margin"><span>but merchants found this inconvenient,</span></span>When
 those countries became commercial, the merchants found this
prohibition, upon many occasions, extremely inconvenient. They could
frequently buy more advantageously with gold and silver than with any
other commodity, the foreign goods which they wanted, either to import
into their own, or to carry to some other foreign country. They
remonstrated, therefore, against this prohibition as hurtful to trade.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1164"><span class="type-margin"><span>and therefore argued that exportation did not always diminish the stock in the country,</span></span>They
 represented, first, that the exportation of gold and silver in order to
 purchase foreign goods, did not always diminish the quantity of those
metals in the kingdom. That, on the contrary, it might frequently
increase that quantity;<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt831" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt831_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 because, if the consumption of foreign goods was not thereby increased
in the country, those goods might be re-exported to foreign countries,
and, being there sold for a large profit, might bring back much more
treasure than was originally sent out to purchase them. Mr. Mun compares
 this operation of foreign trade to the seed-time and harvest of
agriculture. “If we only behold,” says he, “the actions of the
husbandman in the seed-time, when he casteth away much good corn into
the ground, we shall account him rather a madman than a husbandman. But
when we consider his labours in the harvest, which is the end of his
endeavours, we shall find the worth and plentiful increase of his
actions.”<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt832" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt832_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1165"><span class="type-margin"><span>and that the metals could be retained only by attention to the balance of trade.</span></span>They
 represented, secondly, that this prohibition could not hinder the
exportation of gold and silver, which, on account of the smallness of
their bulk in proportion to their value, could easily be smuggled <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>399<span class="bracket">]</span></span> abroad.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt833" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt833_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> That this exportation could only be prevented by a proper attention to, what they called, the balance of trade.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt834" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt834_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 That when the country exported to a greater value than it imported, a
balance became due to it from foreign nations, which was necessarily
paid to it in gold and silver, and thereby increased the quantity of
those metals in the kingdom. But that when it imported to a greater
value than it exported, a contrary balance became due to foreign
nations, which was necessarily paid to them in the same manner, and
thereby diminished that quantity. That in this case to prohibit the
exportation of those metals could not prevent it, but only by making it
more dangerous, render it more expensive. That the exchange was thereby
turned more against the country which owed the balance, than it
otherwise might have been; the merchant who purchased a bill upon the
foreign country being obliged to pay the banker who sold it, not only
for the natural risk, trouble and expence of sending the money thither,
but for the extraordinary risk arising from the prohibition. But that
the more the exchange was against any country, the more the balance of
trade became necessarily against it; the money of that country becoming
necessarily of so much less value, in comparison with that of the
country to which the balance was due. That if the exchange between
England and Holland, for example, was five per cent. against England, it
 would require a hundred and five ounces of silver in England to
purchase a bill for a hundred ounces of silver in Holland: that a
hundred and five ounces of silver in England, therefore, would be worth
only a hundred ounces of silver in Holland, and would purchase only a
proportionable quantity of Dutch goods: but that a hundred ounces of
silver in Holland, on the contrary, would be worth a hundred and five
ounces in England, and would purchase a proportionable quantity of
English goods: that the English goods which were sold to Holland would
be sold so much cheaper; and the Dutch goods which were sold to England,
 so much dearer, by the difference of the exchange; that the one would
draw so much less Dutch money to England, and the other so much more
English money to Holland, as this difference amounted to: and that the
balance of trade, therefore, would necessarily be so much more against
England, and would require a greater balance of gold and silver to be
exported to Holland.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>400<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1166"><span class="type-margin"><span>Their arguments were partly sophistical,</span></span>Those
 arguments were partly solid and partly sophistical. They were solid so
far as they asserted that the exportation of gold and silver in trade
might frequently be advantageous to the country. They were solid too, in
 asserting that no prohibition could prevent their exportation, when
private people found any advantage in exporting them. But they were
sophistical in supposing, that either to preserve or to augment the
quantity of those metals required more the attention of government, than
 to preserve or to augment the quantity of any other useful commodities,
 which the freedom of trade, without any such attention, never fails to
supply in the proper quantity. They were sophistical too, perhaps, in
asserting that the high price of exchange necessarily increased, what
they called, the unfavourable balance of trade, or occasioned the
exportation of a greater quantity of gold and silver. That high price,
indeed, was extremely disadvantageous to the merchants who had any money
 to pay in foreign countries. They paid so much dearer for the bills
which their bankers granted them upon those countries. But though the
risk arising from the prohibition might occasion some extraordinary
expence to the bankers, it would not necessarily carry any more money
out of the country. This expence would generally be all laid out in the
country, in smuggling the money out of it, and could seldom occasion the
 exportation of a single six-pence beyond the precise sum drawn for. The
 high price of exchange too would naturally dispose the merchants to
endeavour to make their exports nearly balance their imports, in order
that they might have this high exchange to pay upon as small a sum as
possible. The high price of exchange, besides, must necessarily have
operated as a tax, in raising the price of foreign goods, and thereby
diminishing their consumption.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt835" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt835_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 It would tend, therefore, not to increase, but to diminish, what they
called, the unfavourable balance of trade, and consequently the
exportation of gold and silver.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1167"><span class="type-margin"><span>but they convinced parliaments and councils.</span></span>Such
 as they were, however, those arguments convinced the people to whom
they were addressed. They were addressed by merchants to parliaments,
and to the councils of princes, to nobles, and to country gentlemen; by
those who were supposed to understand trade, to those who were conscious
 to themselves that they knew nothing about the matter. That foreign
trade enriched the country, experience demonstrated to the nobles and
country gentlemen, as well as to the merchants; but how, or in what
manner, none of them well knew. The merchants knew perfectly in what
manner it enriched themselves. <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>401<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 It was their business to know it. But to know in what manner it
enriched the country, was no part of their business. This subject never
came into their consideration, but when they had occasion to apply to
their country for some change in the laws relating to foreign trade. It
then became necessary to say something about the beneficial effects of
foreign trade, and the manner in which those effects were obstructed by
the laws as they then stood. To the judges who were to decide the
business, it appeared a most satisfactory account of the matter, when
they were told that foreign trade brought money into the country, but
that the laws in question hindered it from bringing so much as it
otherwise would do. Those arguments therefore produced<span class="type-margin"><span>The exportation of foreign coin and bullion was permitted by France and England, and the exportation of Dutch coin by Holland.</span></span>
 the wished-for effect. The prohibition of exporting gold and silver was
 in France and England confined to the coin of those respective
countries. The exportation of foreign coin and of bullion was made free.
 In Holland, and in some other places, this liberty was extended even to
 the coin of the country. The attention of government was turned away
from guarding against the exportation of gold and silver, to watch over
the balance of trade, as the only cause which could occasion any
augmentation or diminution of those metals. From one fruitless care it
was turned away to another care much more intricate, much more
embarrassing, and just equally fruitless. The<span class="type-margin"><span>That treasure was obtained by foreign trade became a received maxim.</span></span> title of Mun’s book, England’s Treasure in<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt836" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt836_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Foreign Trade, became a fundamental maxim in the political œconomy, not
 of England only, but of all other commercial countries. The inland or
home trade, the most important of all, the trade in which an equal
capital affords the greatest revenue, and creates the greatest
employment to the people of the country, was considered as subsidiary
only to foreign trade. It neither brought money into the country, it was
 said, nor carried any out of it. The country therefore could never
become either richer or poorer by means of it, except so far as its
prosperity or decay might indirectly influence the state of foreign
trade.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1168">A country that has no mines of its own must undoubtedly draw its<span class="type-margin"><span>Gold and silver will be imported without any attention of government,</span></span>
 gold and silver from foreign countries, in the same manner as one that
has no vineyards of its own must draw its wines. It does not seem
necessary, however, that the attention of government should be more
turned towards the one than towards the other object. A country that has
 wherewithal to buy wine, will always get the wine which it has occasion
 for; and a country that has wherewithal to buy gold and silver, will
never be in want of those metals. They are to be bought for a certain
price like all other commodities, and as they are the price <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>402<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of all other commodities, so all other commodities are the price of
those metals. We trust with perfect security that the freedom of trade,
without any attention of government, will always supply us with the wine
 which we have occasion for: and we may trust with equal security that
it will always supply us with all the gold and silver which we can
afford to purchase or to employ, either in circulating our commodities,
or in other uses.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1169"><span class="type-margin"><span>They can be imported more easily than other commodities when there is an effectual demand.</span></span>The
 quantity of every commodity which human industry can either purchase or
 produce, naturally regulates itself in every country according to the
effectual demand, or according to the demand of those who are willing to
 pay the whole rent, labour and profits which must be paid in order to
prepare and bring it to market. But no commodities regulate themselves
more easily or more exactly according to this effectual demand than gold
 and silver; because, on account of the small bulk and great value of
those metals, no commodities can be more easily transported from one
place to another, from the places where they are cheap, to those where
they are dear, from the places where they exceed, to those where they
fall short of this effectual demand. If there were in England, for
example, an effectual demand for an additional quantity of gold, a
packet-boat could bring from Lisbon, or from wherever else it was to be
had, fifty tuns of gold, which could be coined into more than five
millions of guineas. But if there were<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt837" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt837_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 an effectual demand for grain to the same value, to import it would
require, at five guineas a tun, a million of tuns of shipping, or a
thousand ships of a thousand tuns each. The navy of England would not be
 sufficient.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1170"><span class="type-margin"><span>When their quantity exceeds the demand it is impossible to prevent their exportation,</span></span>When
 the quantity of gold and silver imported into any country exceeds the
effectual demand, no vigilance of government can prevent their
exportation. All the sanguinary laws of Spain and Portugal are not able
to keep their gold and silver at home. The continual importations from
Peru and Brazil exceed the effectual demand of those countries, and sink
 the price of those metals there below that in the neighbouring
countries. If, on the contrary, in any particular country their quantity
 fell short of the effectual demand, so as to raise their price above
that of<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt838" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt838_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> the neighbouring countries, the government would<span class="type-margin"><span>and it would be equally impossible to prevent their importation if the supply fell short of the effectual demand.</span></span> have no occasion to take any pains to import them. If it were<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt839" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt839_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 even to take pains to prevent their importation, it would not be able
to effectuate it. Those metals, when the Spartans had got wherewithal to
 purchase them, broke through all the barriers which the laws of
Lycurgus <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>403<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 opposed to their entrance into Lacedemon. All the sanguinary laws of
the customs are not able to prevent the importation of the teas of the
Dutch and Gottenburgh East India companies; because somewhat cheaper
than those of the British company. A pound of tea, however, is about a
hundred times the bulk of one of the highest prices, sixteen shillings,
that is commonly paid for it in silver, and more than two thousand times
 the bulk of the same price in gold, and consequently just so many times
 more difficult to smuggle.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1171">It is partly owing to the easy transportation of gold and silver from<span class="type-margin"><span>It is this ease of transportation which makes the value of gold and silver so uniform.</span></span>
 the places where they abound to those where they are wanted, that the
price of those metals does not fluctuate continually like that of the
greater part of other commodities, which are hindered by their bulk from
 shifting their situation, when the market happens to be either over or
under-stocked with them. The price of those metals, indeed, is not
altogether exempted from variation, but the changes to which it is
liable are generally slow, gradual, and uniform. In Europe, for example,
 it is supposed, without much foundation, perhaps, that, during the
course of the present and preceding century, they have been constantly,
but gradually, sinking in their value, on account of the continual
importations from the Spanish West Indies.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt840" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt840_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 But to make any sudden change in the price of gold and silver, so as to
 raise or lower at once, sensibly and remarkably, the money price of all
 other commodities, requires such a revolution in commerce as that
occasioned by the discovery of America.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1172">If, notwithstanding all this, gold and silver should at any time fall<span class="type-margin"><span>If they did fall short, their place could be supplied by paper.</span></span>
 short in a country which has wherewithal to purchase them, there are
more expedients for supplying their place, than that of almost any other
 commodity. If the materials of manufacture are wanted, industry must
stop. If provisions are wanted, the people must starve. But if money is
wanted, barter will supply its place, though with a good deal of
inconveniency. Buying and selling upon credit, and the different dealers
 compensating their credits with one another, once a month or once a
year, will supply it with less inconveniency. A well-regulated paper
money will supply it, not only without any inconveniency, but, in some
cases, with some advantages.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt841" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt841_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 Upon every account, therefore, the attention of government never was so
 unnecessarily employed, as when directed to watch over the preservation
 or increase of the quantity of money in any country.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>404<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1173"><span class="type-margin"><span>The common complaint of scarcity of money only means difficulty in borrowing.</span></span>No
 complaint, however, is more common than that of a scarcity of money.
Money, like wine, must always be scarce with those who have neither
wherewithal to buy it, nor credit to borrow it. Those who have either,
will seldom be in want either of the money, or of the wine which they
have occasion for. This complaint, however, of the scarcity of money, is
 not always confined to improvident spendthrifts. It is sometimes
general through a whole mercantile town, and the country in its
neighbourhood. Over-trading is the common cause of it. Sober men, whose
projects have been disproportioned to their capitals, are as likely to
have neither wherewithal to buy money, nor credit to borrow it, as
prodigals whose expence has been disproportioned to their revenue.
Before their projects can be brought to bear, their stock is gone, and
their credit with it. They run about everywhere to borrow money, and
every body tells them that they have none to lend. Even such general
complaints of the scarcity of money do not always prove that the usual
number of gold and silver pieces are not circulating in the country, but
 that many people want those pieces who have nothing to give for them.
When the profits of trade happen to be greater than ordinary,
over-trading becomes a general error both among great and small dealers.
 They do not always send more money abroad than usual, but they buy upon
 credit both at home and abroad, an unusual quantity of goods, which
they send to some distant market, in hopes that the returns will come in
 before the demand for payment. The demand comes before the returns, and
 they have nothing at hand, with which they can either purchase money,
or give solid security for borrowing. It is not any scarcity of gold and
 silver, but the difficulty which such people find in borrowing, and
which their creditors find in getting payment, that occasions the
general complaint of the scarcity of money.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1174"><span class="type-margin"><span>Money makes but a small part of the national capital.</span></span>It
 would be too ridiculous to go about seriously to prove, that wealth
does not consist in money, or in gold and silver; but in what money
purchases, and is valuable only for purchasing. Money, no doubt, makes
always a part of the national capital; but it has already been shown<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt842" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt842_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> that it generally makes but a small part, and always the most unprofitable part of it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1175"><span class="type-margin"><span>It is easier to buy than to sell simply because money is the instrument of commerce.</span></span>It
 is not because wealth consists more essentially in money than in goods,
 that the merchant finds it generally more easy to buy goods with money,
 than to buy money with goods; but because money is the known and
established instrument of commerce, for which every <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>405<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 thing is readily given in exchange, but which is not always with equal
readiness to be got in exchange for every thing. The greater part of
goods besides are more perishable than money, and he may frequently
sustain a much greater loss by keeping them. When his goods are upon
hand too, he is more liable to such demands for money as he may not be
able to answer, than when he has got their price in his coffers. Over
and above all this, his profit arises more directly from selling than
from buying, and he is upon all these accounts generally much more
anxious to exchange his goods for money, than his money for goods. But
though a particular merchant, with abundance of goods in his warehouse,
may sometimes be ruined by not being able to sell them in time, a nation
 or country is not liable to the same accident. The whole capital of a
merchant frequently consists in perishable goods destined for purchasing
 money. But it is but a very small part of the annual produce of the
land and labour of a country which can ever be destined for purchasing
gold and silver from their neighbours. The far greater part is
circulated and consumed among themselves; and even of the surplus which
is sent abroad, the greater part is generally destined for the purchase
of other foreign goods. Though gold and silver, therefore, could not be
had in exchange for the goods destined to purchase them, the nation
would not be ruined. It might, indeed, suffer some loss and
inconveniency, and be forced upon some of those expedients which are
necessary for supplying the place of money. The annual produce of its
land and labour, however, would be the same, or very nearly the same, as
 usual, because the same, or very nearly the same consumable capital
would be employed in maintaining it. And though goods do not always draw
 money so readily as money draws goods, in the long-run they draw it
more necessarily than even it draws them. Goods can serve many other
purposes besides purchasing money, but money can serve no other purpose
besides purchasing goods. Money, therefore, necessarily runs after
goods, but goods do not always or necessarily run after money. The man
who buys, does not always mean to sell again, but frequently to use or
to consume; whereas he who sells, always means to buy again. The one may
 frequently have done the whole, but the other can never have done more
than the one-half of his business. It is not for its own sake that men
desire money, but for the sake of what they can purchase with it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1176">Consumable commodities, it is said, are soon destroyed; whereas<span class="type-margin"><span>The durability of a commodity is no reason for accumulating more of it than is wanted.</span></span>
 gold and silver are of a more durable nature, and, were it not for this
 continual exportation, might be accumulated for ages together, to the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>406<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 incredible augmentation of the real wealth of the country. Nothing,
therefore, it is pretended, can be more disadvantageous to any country,
than the trade which consists in the exchange of such lasting for such
perishable commodities. We do not, however, reckon that trade
disadvantageous which consists in the exchange of the hard-ware of
England for the wines of France; and yet hard-ware is a very durable
commodity, and were it not<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt843" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt843_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 for this continual exportation, might too be accumulated for ages
together, to the incredible augmentation of the pots and pans of the
country. But it readily occurs that the number of such utensils is in
every country necessarily limited by the use which there is for them;
that it would be absurd to have more pots and pans than were necessary
for cooking the victuals usually consumed there; and that if the
quantity of victuals were to increase, the number of pots and pans would
 readily increase along with it, a part of the increased quantity of
victuals being employed in purchasing them, or in maintaining an
additional number of workmen whose business it was to make them. It
should as readily occur that the quantity of gold and silver is in every
 country limited by the use which there is for those metals; that their
use consists in circulating commodities as coin, and in affording a
species of houshold furniture as plate; that the quantity of coin in
every country is regulated by the value of the commodities which are to
be circulated by it: increase that value, and immediately a part of it
will be sent abroad to purchase, wherever it is to be had, the
additional quantity of coin requisite for circulating them: that the
quantity of plate is regulated by the number and wealth of those private
 families who chuse to indulge themselves in that sort of magnificence:
increase the number and wealth of such families, and a part of this
increased wealth will most probably be employed in purchasing, wherever
it is to be found, an additional quantity of plate: that to attempt to
increase the wealth of any country, either by introducing or by
detaining in it an unnecessary quantity of gold and silver, is as absurd
 as it would be to attempt to increase the good cheer of private
families, by obliging them to keep an unnecessary number of kitchen
utensils. As the expence of purchasing those unnecessary utensils would
diminish instead of increasing either the quantity or goodness of the
family provisions; so the expence of purchasing an unnecessary quantity
of gold and silver must, in every country, as necessarily diminish the
wealth which feeds, clothes, and lodges, which maintains and employs the
 people. Gold and silver, whether in the shape of coin or of plate, are
utensils, it must be <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>407<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 remembered, as much as the furniture of the kitchen. Increase the use
for them, increase the consumable commodities which are to be
circulated, managed, and prepared by means of them, and you will
infallibly increase the quantity; but if you attempt, by extraordinary
means, to increase the quantity, you will as infallibly diminish the use
 and even the quantity too, which in those metals can never be greater
than what the use requires. Were they ever to be accumulated beyond this
 quantity, their transportation is so easy, and the loss which attends
their lying idle and unemployed so great, that no law could prevent
their being immediately sent out of the country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1177">It is not always necessary to accumulate gold and silver, in order to<span class="type-margin"><span>Accumulation of gold and silver is not necessary for carrying on distant wars,</span></span>
 enable a country to carry on foreign wars, and to maintain fleets and
armies in distant countries. Fleets and armies are maintained, not with
gold and silver, but with consumable goods. The nation which, from the
annual produce of its domestic industry, from the annual revenue arising
 out of its lands, labour, and consumable stock, has wherewithal to
purchase those consumable goods in distant countries, can maintain
foreign wars there.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1178">A nation may purchase the pay and provisions of an army in a<span class="type-margin"><span>which may be paid for by exporting: (1) gold and silver, (2) manufactures, or (3) rude produce</span></span>
 distant country three different ways; by sending abroad either, first,
some part of its accumulated gold and silver; or secondly, some part of
the annual produce of its manufactures; or last of all, some part of its
 annual rude produce.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1179">The gold and silver which can properly be
considered as accumulated or stored up in any country, may be
distinguished into three parts; first, the circulating money; secondly,
the plate of private families;<span class="type-margin"><span>The gold and silver consists of money in circulation, plate, and money in the treasury.</span></span> and last of all, the money which may have been collected by many years parsimony, and laid up in the treasury of the prince.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1180">It can seldom happen that much can be spared
from the circulating money of the country; because in that there can
seldom be much redundancy.<span class="type-margin"><span>Little can be spared from the money in circulation;</span></span>
 The value of goods annually bought and sold in any country requires a
certain quantity of money to circulate and distribute them to their
proper consumers, and can give employment to no more. The channel of
circulation necessarily draws to itself a sum sufficient to fill it, and
 never admits any more. Something, however, is generally withdrawn from
this channel in the case of foreign war. By the great number of people
who are maintained abroad, fewer are maintained at home. Fewer goods are
 circulated there, and less money becomes necessary to circulate them.
An extraordinary quantity of paper money, of some sort or other too,
such as exchequer notes, navy bills, and bank bills in England, is
generally issued upon such occasions, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>408<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 and by supplying the place of circulating gold and silver, gives an
opportunity of sending a greater quantity of it abroad. All this,
however, could afford but a poor resource for maintaining a foreign war,
 of great expence and several years duration.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1181"><span class="type-margin"><span>plate has never yielded much;</span></span>The
 melting down the plate of private families, has upon every occasion
been found a still more insignificant one. The French, in the beginning
of the last war, did not derive so much advantage from this expedient as
 to compensate the loss of the fashion.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1182"><span class="type-margin"><span>accumulation in the treasury has been abandoned.</span></span>The
 accumulated treasures of the prince have, in former times, afforded a
much greater and more lasting resource. In the present times, if you
except the king of Prussia, to accumulate treasure seems to be no part
of the policy of European princes.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1183"><span class="type-margin"><span>The foreign wars of the century have evidently not been paid for from the money in circulation,</span></span>The
 funds which maintained the foreign wars of the present century, the
most expensive perhaps which history records, seem to have had little
dependency upon the exportation either of the circulating money, or of
the plate of private families, or of the treasure of the prince. The
last French war cost Great Britain upwards of ninety millions, including
 not only the seventy-five millions of new debt that was contracted,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt844" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt844_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 but the additional two shillings in the pound land tax, and what was
annually borrowed of the sinking fund. More than two-thirds of this
expence were<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt845" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt845_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 laid out in distant countries; in Germany, Portugal, America, in the
ports of the Mediterranean, in the East and West Indies. The kings of
England had no accumulated treasure. We never heard of any extraordinary
 quantity of plate being melted down. The circulating gold and silver of
 the country had not been supposed to exceed eighteen millions. Since
the late recoinage of the gold, however, it is believed to have been a
good deal under-rated. Let us suppose, therefore, according to the most
exaggerated computation which I remember to have either seen or heard
of,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt846" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt846_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> that, gold and silver together, it amounted to thirty millions.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt847" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt847_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 Had the war been carried on, by means of our money, the whole of it
must, even according to this computation, have been sent out and
returned again at least twice, in a period of between six and seven
years. Should this be supposed, it would afford the most decisive
argument to demonstrate how unnecessary it is for government to watch
over the preservation of money, since upon this supposition the whole
money of the country must have gone from it and returned to it again,
two different times in so short a period, without any body’s knowing any
 thing of the matter. <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>409<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 The channel of circulation, however, never appeared more empty than
usual during any part of this period. Few people wanted money who had
wherewithal to pay for it. The profits of foreign trade, indeed, were
greater than usual during the whole war; but especially towards the end
of it. This occasioned, what it always occasions, a general over-trading
 in all the ports of Great Britain; and this again occasioned the usual
complaint of the scarcity of money, which always follows over-trading.
Many people wanted it, who had neither wherewithal to buy it, nor credit
 to borrow it; and because the debtors found it difficult to borrow, the
 creditors found it difficult to get payment. Gold and silver, however,
were generally to be had for their value, by those who had that value to
 give for them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1184">The enormous expence of the late war, therefore, must have been<span class="type-margin"><span>but by commodities.</span></span>
 chiefly defrayed, not by the exportation of gold and silver, but by
that of British commodities of some kind or other. When the government,
or those who acted under them, contracted with a merchant for a
remittance to some foreign country, he would naturally endeavour to pay
his foreign correspondent, upon whom he had granted a bill, by sending
abroad rather commodities than gold and silver. If the commodities of
Great Britain were not in demand in that country, he would endeavour to
send them to some other country, in which he could purchase a bill upon
that country. The transportation of commodities, when properly suited to
 the market, is always attended with a considerable profit; whereas that
 of gold and silver is scarce ever attended with any. When those metals
are sent abroad in order to purchase foreign commodities, the merchant’s
 profit arises, not from the purchase, but from the sale of the returns.
 But when they are sent abroad merely to pay a debt, he gets no returns,
 and consequently no profit. He naturally, therefore, exerts his
invention to find out a way of paying his foreign debts, rather by the
exportation of commodities than by that of gold and silver. The great
quantity of British goods exported during the course of the late war,
without bringing back any returns, is accordingly remarked by the author
 of The Present State of the Nation.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt848" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt848_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1185">Besides the three sorts of gold and silver above mentioned, there is<span class="type-margin"><span>Part
 of the bullion which circulates from country to country may have been
employed, but it must have been purchased with commodities.</span></span>
 in all great commercial countries a good deal of bullion alternately
imported and exported for the purposes of foreign trade. This bullion,
as it circulates among different commercial countries in the same manner
 as the national coin circulates in every particular country, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>410<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 may be considered as the money of the great mercantile republic. The
national coin receives its movement and direction from the commodities
circulated within the precincts of each particular country: the money of
 the mercantile republic, from those circulated between different
countries. Both are employed in facilitating exchanges, the one between
different individuals of the same, the other between those of different
nations. Part of this money of the great mercantile republic may have
been, and probably was, employed in carrying on the late war. In time of
 a general war, it is natural to suppose that a movement and direction
should be impressed upon it, different from what it usually follows in
profound peace; that it should circulate more about the seat of the war,
 and be more employed in purchasing there, and in the neighbouring
countries, the pay and provisions of the different armies. But whatever
part of this money of the mercantile republic, Great Britain may have
annually employed in this manner, it must have been annually purchased,
either with British commodities, or with something else that had been
purchased with them; which still brings us back to commodities, to the
annual produce of the land and labour of the country, as the ultimate
resources which enabled us to carry on the war. It is natural indeed to
suppose, that so great an annual expence must have been defrayed from a
great annual produce. The expence of 1761, for example, amounted to more
 than nineteen millions. No accumulation could have supported so great
an annual profusion. There is no annual produce even of gold and silver
which could have supported it. The whole gold and silver annually
imported into both Spain and Portugal, according to the best accounts,
does not commonly much exceed six millions sterling,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt849" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt849_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> which, in some years, would scarce have paid four months expence of the late war.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1186"><span class="type-margin"><span>The finer manufactures are the most convenient commodities for the purpose.</span></span>The
 commodities most proper for being transported to distant countries, in
order to purchase there, either the pay and provisions of an army, or
some part of the money of the mercantile republic to be employed in
purchasing them, seem to be the finer and more improved manufactures;
such as contain a great value in a small bulk, and can, therefore, be
exported to a great distance at little expence. A country whose industry
 produces a great annual surplus of such manufactures, which are usually
 exported to foreign countries, may carry on for many years a very
expensive foreign war, without either exporting any considerable
quantity of gold and silver, or even having any such quantity to export.
 A considerable part of the annual surplus of its manufactures must,
indeed, in this case be exported, without bringing back <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>411<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 any returns to the country, though it does to the merchant; the
government purchasing of the merchant his bills upon foreign countries,
in order to purchase there the pay and provisions of an army. Some part
of this surplus, however, may still continue to bring back a return.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt850" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt850_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The manufacturers, during the war, will have a double demand upon them,
 and be called upon, first, to work up goods to be sent abroad, for
paying the bills drawn upon foreign countries for the pay and provisions
 of the army; and, secondly, to work up such as are necessary for
purchasing the common returns that had usually been consumed in the
country. In the midst of the most destructive foreign war, therefore,
the greater part of manufactures may frequently flourish greatly; and,
on the contrary, they may decline on the return of the peace. They may
flourish amidst the ruin of their country, and begin to decay upon the
return of its prosperity. The different state of many different branches
 of the British manufactures during the late war, and for some time
after the peace, may serve as an illustration of what has been just now
said.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1187">No foreign war of great expence or duration could conveniently be<span class="type-margin"><span>Rude produce is inconvenient.</span></span>
 carried on by the exportation of the rude produce of the soil. The
expence of sending such a quantity of it to a foreign country as might
purchase the pay and provisions of an army, would be too great. Few
countries too produce much more rude produce than what is sufficient for
 the subsistence of their own inhabitants. To send abroad any great
quantity of it, therefore, would be to send abroad a part of the
necessary subsistence of the people. It is otherwise with the
exportation of manufactures. The maintenance of the people employed in
them is kept at home, and only the surplus part of their work is
exported. Mr. Hume frequently takes notice of the inability of the
ancient kings of England to carry on, without interruption, any foreign
war of long duration.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt851" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt851_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 The English, in those days, had nothing wherewithal to purchase the pay
 and provisions of their armies in foreign countries, but either the
rude produce of the soil, of which no considerable part could be spared
from the home consumption, or a few manufactures of the coarsest kind,
of which, as well as of the rude produce, the transportation was too
expensive. This inability did not arise from the want of money, but of
the finer and more improved manufactures. Buying and selling was
transacted by means of money in England then, as well as now. The
quantity of circulating money <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>412<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 must have borne the same proportion to the number and value of
purchases and sales usually transacted at that time, which it does to
those transacted at present; or rather it must have borne a greater
proportion, because there was then no paper, which now occupies a great
part of the employment of gold and silver. Among nations to whom
commerce and manufactures are little known, the sovereign, upon
extraordinary occasions, can seldom draw any considerable aid from his
subjects, for reasons which shall be explained hereafter.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt852" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt852_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 It is in such countries, therefore, that he generally endeavours to
accumulate a treasure, as the only resource against such emergencies.
Independent of this necessity, he is in such a situation naturally
disposed to the parsimony requisite for accumulation. In that simple
state, the expence even of a sovereign is not directed by the vanity
which delights in the gaudy finery of a court, but is employed in bounty
 to his tenants, and hospitality to his retainers. But bounty and
hospitality very seldom lead to extravagance; though vanity almost
always does.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt853" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt853_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 Every Tartar chief, accordingly, has a treasure. The treasures of
Mazepa, chief of the Cossacks in the Ukraine, the famous ally of Charles
 the XIIth, are said to have been very great. The French kings of the
Merovingian race had all treasures. When they divided their kingdom
among their different children, they divided their treasure too. The
Saxon princes, and the first kings after the conquest, seem likewise to
have accumulated treasures. The first exploit of every new reign was
commonly to seize the treasure of the preceding king, as the most
essential measure for securing the succession. The sovereigns of
improved and commercial countries are not under the same necessity of
accumulating treasures, because they can generally draw from their
subjects extraordinary aids upon extraordinary occasions. They are
likewise less disposed to do so. They naturally, perhaps necessarily,
follow the mode of the times, and their expence comes to be regulated by
 the same extravagant vanity which directs that of all the other great
proprietors in their dominions. The insignificant pageantry of their
court becomes every day more brilliant, and the expence of it not only
prevents accumulation, but frequently encroaches upon the funds destined
 for more necessary expences. What Dercyllidas said of the court of
Persia, may be applied to that of several European princes, that he saw
there much splendor but little strength, and many servants but few
soldiers.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt854" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt854_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>

<p id="Smith_0206-01_1188">The importation of gold and silver is not the principal, much less the<span class="type-margin"><span>The
 principal benefit of foreign trade is not the importation of gold and
silver, but the carrying out of surplus produce for which there is no

sole benefit which a nation derives from its foreign trade. Between
whatever places foreign trade is carried on, they all of them derive two
 distinct benefits from it. It carries out that surplus part of the
produce of their land and labour for which there is no demand among
them, and brings back in return for it something else for which there is
 a demand. It gives a value to their superfluities, by exchanging them
for something else, which may satisfy a part of their wants, and
increase their enjoyments. By means of it, the narrowness of the home
market does not hinder the division of labour in any particular branch
of art or manufacture from being carried to the highest perfection. By
opening a more extensive market for whatever part of the produce of
their labour may exceed the home consumption, it encourages them to
improve its productive powers, and to augment its annual produce to the
utmost, and thereby to increase<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt855" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt855_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 the real revenue and wealth of the society. These great and important
services foreign trade is continually occupied in performing, to all the
 different countries between which it is carried on. They all derive
great benefit from it, though that in which the merchant resides
generally derives the greatest, as he is generally more employed in
supplying the wants, and carrying out the superfluities of his own, than
 of any other particular country. To import the gold and silver which
may be wanted, into the countries which have no mines, is, no doubt, a
part of the business of foreign commerce. It is, however, a most
insignificant part of it. A country which carried on foreign trade
merely upon this account, could scarce have occasion to freight a ship
in a century.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1189">It is not by the importation of gold and silver, that the discovery of<span class="type-margin"><span>The discovery of America has benefited Europe not by the cheapening of gold and silver,</span></span>
 America has enriched Europe. By the abundance of the American mines,
those metals have become cheaper. A service of plate can now be
purchased for about a third part of the corn, or a third part of the
labour, which it would have cost in the fifteenth century. With the same
 annual expence of labour and commodities, Europe can annually purchase
about three times the quantity of plate which it could have purchased at
 that time. But when a commodity comes to be sold for a third part of
what had been its usual price, not only those who purchased it before
can purchase three times their former quantity, but it is brought down
to the level of a much greater number of purchasers, perhaps to more
than ten, perhaps to more than twenty times the former number. So that
there may be in Europe at present not only more than three times, but
more than twenty or thirty times the quantity <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>414<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of plate which would have been in it, even in its present state of
improvement, had the discovery of the American mines never been made. So
 far Europe has, no doubt, gained a real conveniency, though surely a
very trifling one. The cheapness of gold and silver renders those metals
 rather less fit for the purposes of money than they were before. In
order to make the same purchases, we must load ourselves with a greater
quantity of them, and carry about a shilling in our pocket where a groat
 would have done before. It is difficult to say which is most trifling,
this inconveniency, or the opposite conveniency. Neither the one nor the
 other could have made any very essential change in the state of Europe.
 The discovery of America, however,<span class="type-margin"><span>but by opening up of a new market which improved the productive powers of labour.</span></span>
 certainly made a most essential one. By opening a new and inexhaustible
 market to all the commodities of Europe, it gave occasion to new
divisions of labour and improvements of art, which, in the narrow circle
 of the ancient commerce, could never have taken place for want of a
market to take off the greater part of their produce. The productive
powers of labour were improved, and its produce increased in all the
different countries of Europe, and together with it the real revenue and
 wealth of the inhabitants. The commodities of Europe were almost all
new to America, and many of those of America were new to Europe. A new
set of exchanges, therefore, began to take place which had never been
thought of before, and which should naturally have proved as
advantageous to the new, as it certainly did to the old continent. The
savage injustice of the Europeans rendered an event, which ought to have
 been beneficial to all, ruinous and destructive to several of those
unfortunate countries.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1190"><span class="type-margin"><span>The discovery
 of the sea passage to the East Indies would have been still more
advantageous if the trade to the East Indies had been free.</span></span>The
 discovery of a passage to the East Indies, by the Cape of Good Hope,
which happened much about the same time, opened, perhaps, a still more
extensive range to foreign commerce than even that of America,
notwithstanding the greater distance. There were but two nations in
America, in any respect superior to savages, and these were destroyed
almost as soon as discovered. The rest were mere savages. But the
empires of China, Indostan, Japan, as well as several others in the East
 Indies, without having richer mines of gold or silver, were in every
other respect much richer, better cultivated, and more advanced in all
arts and manufactures than either Mexico or Peru, even though we should
credit, what plainly deserves no credit, the exaggerated accounts of the
 Spanish writers, concerning the ancient state of those empires. But
rich and civilized nations can always exchange to a much greater value
with one another, than with savages and barbarians. Europe, however, has
 hitherto derived much less advantage from its commerce <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>415<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 with the East Indies, than from that with America. The Portuguese
monopolized the East India trade to themselves for about a century, and
it was only indirectly and through them, that the other nations of
Europe could either send out or receive any goods from that country.
When the Dutch, in the beginning of the last century, began to encroach
upon them, they vested their whole East India commerce in an exclusive
company. The English, French, Swedes, and Danes, have all followed their
 example, so that no great nation in Europe has ever yet had the benefit
 of a free commerce to the East Indies. No other reason need be assigned
 why it has never been so advantageous as the trade to America, which,
between almost every nation of Europe and its own colonies, is free to
all its subjects. The exclusive privileges of those East India
companies, their great riches, the great favour and protection which
these have procured them from their respective governments, have excited
 much envy against them. This envy has<span class="type-margin"><span>The exportation of silver to the East Indies is not harmful.</span></span>
 frequently represented their trade as altogether pernicious, on account
 of the great quantities of silver, which it every year exports from the
 countries from which it is carried on. The parties concerned have
replied, that their trade, by this continual exportation of silver,
might, indeed, tend to impoverish Europe in general, but not the
particular country from which it was carried on; because, by the
exportation of a part of the returns to other European countries, it
annually brought home a much greater quantity of that metal than it
carried out. Both the objection and the reply are founded in the popular
 notion which I have been just now examining. It is, therefore,
unnecessary to say any thing further about either. By the annual
exportation of silver to the East Indies, plate is probably somewhat
dearer in Europe than it otherwise might have been; and coined silver
probably purchases a larger quantity both of labour and commodities. The
 former of these two effects is a very small loss, the latter a very
small advantage; both too insignificant to deserve any part of the
public attention. The trade to the East Indies, by opening a market to
the commodities of Europe, or, what comes nearly to the same thing, to
the gold and silver which is purchased with those commodities, must
necessarily tend to increase the annual production of European
commodities, and consequently the real wealth and revenue of Europe.
That it has hitherto increased them so little, is probably owing to the
restraints which it every-where labours under.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1191">I thought it necessary, though at the hazard of being tedious, to<span class="type-margin"><span>Writers who begin by including lands, houses and consumable goods in wealth often forget them later.</span></span>
 examine at full length this popular notion that wealth consists in
money, or in gold and silver. Money in common language, as I have <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>416<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 already observed, frequently signifies wealth; and this ambiguity of
expression has rendered this popular notion so familiar to us, that even
 they, who are convinced of its absurdity, are very apt to forget their
own principles, and in the course of their reasonings to take it for
granted as a certain and undeniable truth. Some of the best English
writers upon commerce set out with observing, that the wealth of a
country consists, not in its gold and silver only, but in its lands,
houses, and consumable goods of all different kinds. In the course of
their reasonings, however, the lands, houses, and consumable goods seem
to slip out of their memory, and the strain of their argument frequently
 supposes that all wealth consists in gold and silver, and that to
multiply those metals is the great object of national industry and
commerce.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1192"><span class="type-margin"><span>Wealth being supposed to consist in gold and silver, political economy endeavoured to diminish imports and encourage exports,</span></span>The
 two principles being established, however, that wealth consisted in
gold and silver, and that those metals could be brought into a country
which had no mines only by the balance of trade, or by exporting to a
greater value than it imported; it necessarily became the great object
of political œconomy to diminish as much as possible the importation of
foreign goods for home consumption, and to increase as much as possible
the exportation of the produce of domestic industry. Its two great
engines for enriching the country, therefore, were restraints upon
importation, and encouragements to exportation.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1193">The restraints upon importation were of two kinds.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1194"><span class="type-margin"><span>by restraints upon importation</span></span>First,
 Restraints upon the importation of such foreign goods for home
consumption as could be produced at home, from whatever country they
were imported.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1195">Secondly, Restraints upon the importation of
goods of almost all kinds from those particular countries with which the
 balance of trade was supposed to be disadvantageous.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1196">Those different restraints consisted sometimes in high duties, and sometimes in absolute prohibitions.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1197"><span class="type-margin"><span>and encouragements to exportation,</span></span>Exportation
 was encouraged sometimes by drawbacks, sometimes by bounties, sometimes
 by advantageous treaties of commerce with foreign states, and sometimes
 by the establishment of colonies in distant countries.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1198">Drawbacks were given upon two different
occasions. When the home-manufactures were subject to any duty or
excise, either the whole or a part of it was frequently drawn back upon
their exportation; and when foreign goods liable to a duty were imported
 in order to be exported again, either the whole or a part of this duty
was sometimes given back upon such exportation.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>417<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1199">Bounties were given for the encouragement
either of some beginning manufactures, or of such sorts of industry of
other kinds as were supposed to deserve particular favour.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1200">By advantageous treaties of commerce,
particular privileges were procured in some foreign state for the goods
and merchants of the country, beyond what were granted to those of other
 countries.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1201">By the establishment of colonies in distant
countries, not only particular privileges, but a monopoly was frequently
 procured for the goods and merchants of the country which established
them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1202">The two sorts of restraints upon importation above-mentioned,<span class="type-margin"><span>which restraints and encouragements will be considered in the next six chapters.</span></span>
 together with these four encouragements to exportation, constitute the
six principal means by which the commercial system proposes to increase
the quantity of gold and silver in any country by turning the balance of
 trade in its favour. I shall consider each of them in a particular
chapter, and without taking much further notice of their supposed
tendency to bring money into the country, I shall examine chiefly what
are likely to be the effects of each of them upon the annual produce of
its industry. According as they tend either to increase or diminish the
value of this annual produce, they must evidently tend either to
increase or diminish the real wealth and revenue of the country.</p>

<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-01_1203"><span class="type-margin"><span>High duties and prohibitions giving a monopoly to a particular home industry are very common.</span></span>BY
 restraining, either by high duties, or by absolute prohibitions, the
importation of such goods from foreign countries as can be produced at
home, the monopoly of the home market is more or less secured to the
domestic industry employed in producing them. Thus the prohibition of
importing either live cattle<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt856" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt856_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 or salt provisions from foreign countries secures to the graziers of
Great Britain the monopoly of the home market for butcher’s meat. The
high duties upon the importation of corn,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt857" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt857_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 which in times of moderate plenty amount to a prohibition, give a like
advantage to the growers of that commodity. The prohibition of the
importation of foreign woollens is equally favourable to the woollen
manufacturers.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt858" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt858_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> The silk manufacture, though altogether employed upon foreign materials, has lately obtained the same advantage.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt859" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt859_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> The linen manufacture has not yet obtained it, but is making great strides towards it.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt860" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt860_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a> Many other sorts of manufacturers<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt861" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt861_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">6</a>
 have, in the same manner, obtained in Great Britain, either altogether,
 or very nearly a monopoly against their countrymen. The variety of
goods of which the importation into Great Britain is prohibited, either
absolutely, or under certain circumstances, greatly exceeds what can
easily be suspected by those who are not well acquainted with the laws
of the customs.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt862" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt862_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">7</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1204"><span class="type-margin"><span>They encourage the particular industry, but neither increase general industry nor give it the best direction.</span></span>That
 this monopoly of the home-market frequently gives great encouragement
to that particular species of industry which enjoys it, and frequently
turns towards that employment a greater share of both the labour and
stock of the society than would otherwise have gone to it, cannot be
doubted. But whether it tends either to increase the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>419<span class="bracket">]</span></span> general industry of the society, or to give it the most advantageous direction, is not, perhaps, altogether so evident.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt863" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt863_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1205">The general industry of the society never can
 exceed what the capital of the society can employ. As the number of
workmen that can be kept in employment by any particular person must
bear a certain proportion to his capital,<span class="type-margin"><span>The number of persons employed cannot exceed a certain proportion to the capital of the society,</span></span>
 so the number of those that can be continually employed by all the
members of a great society, must bear a certain proportion to the whole
capital of that society, and never can exceed that proportion. No
regulation of commerce can increase the quantity of industry in any
society beyond what its capital can maintain. It can only divert a part
of it into a direction into which it might not otherwise have gone; and
it is by no means certain that this artificial direction is likely to be
 more advantageous to the society than that into which it would have
gone of its own accord.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1206">Every individual is continually exerting himself to find out the most<span class="type-margin"><span>and every man’s interest leads him to seek that employment of capital which is most advantageous to the society.</span></span>
 advantageous employment for whatever capital he can command. It is his
own advantage, indeed, and not that of the society, which he has in
view. But the study of his own advantage naturally, or rather
necessarily leads him to prefer that employment which is most
advantageous to the society.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1207">First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home<span class="type-margin"><span>(1) He tries to employ it as near home as possible</span></span>
 as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of
domestic industry; provided always that he can thereby obtain the
ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1208">Thus, upon equal or nearly equal profits,
every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home-trade to the foreign
 trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the
carrying trade. In the home-trade his capital is never so long out of
his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. He
can know better the character and situation of the persons whom he
trusts, and if he should happen to be deceived, he knows better the laws
 of the country from which he must seek redress. In the carrying trade,
the capital of the merchant is, as it were, divided between two foreign
countries, and no part of it is ever necessarily brought home, or placed
 under his own immediate view and command. The capital which an
Amsterdam merchant employs in carrying corn from Konnigsberg to Lisbon,
and fruit and wine from Lisbon to Konnigsberg, must generally be the
one-half of it at Konnigsberg and the other half at Lisbon. No part of
it need ever come to Amsterdam. The natural residence of such a merchant
 should either be at Konnigsberg or Lisbon, and it can only <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>420<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 be some very particular circumstances which can make him prefer the
residence of Amsterdam. The uneasiness, however, which he feels at being
 separated so far from his capital, generally determines him to bring
part both of the Konnigsberg goods which he destines for the market of
Lisbon, and of the Lisbon goods which he destines for that of
Konnigsberg, to Amsterdam: and though this necessarily subjects him to a
 double charge of loading and unloading, as well as to the payment of
some duties and customs, yet for the sake of having some part of his
capital always under his own view and command, he willingly submits to
this extraordinary charge; and it is in this manner that every country
which has any considerable share of the carrying trade, becomes always
the emporium, or general market, for the goods of all the different
countries whose trade it carries on. The merchant, in order to save a
second loading and unloading, endeavours always to sell in the
home-market as much of the goods of all those different countries as he
can, and thus, so far as he can, to convert his carrying trade into a
foreign trade of consumption. A merchant, in the same manner, who is
engaged in the foreign trade of consumption, when he collects goods for
foreign markets, will always be glad, upon equal or nearly equal
profits, to sell as great a part of them at home as he can. He saves
himself the risk and trouble of exportation, when, so far as he can, he
thus converts his foreign trade of consumption into a home-trade. Home
is in this manner the center, if I may say so, round which the capitals
of the inhabitants of every country are continually circulating, and
towards which they are always tending, though by particular causes they
may sometimes be driven off and repelled from it towards more distant
employments. But a capital employed in the home-trade, it has already
been shown,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt864" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt864_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 necessarily puts into motion a greater quantity of domestic industry,
and gives revenue and employment to a greater number of the inhabitants
of the country, than an equal capital employed in the foreign trade of
consumption: and one employed in the foreign trade of consumption has
the same advantage over an equal capital employed in the carrying trade.
 Upon equal, or only nearly equal profits, therefore, every individual
naturally inclines to employ his capital in the manner in which it is
likely to afford the greatest support to domestic industry, and to give
revenue and employment to the greatest number of<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt865" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt865_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> people of his own country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1209"><span class="type-margin"><span>(2) He endeavours to produce the greatest possible value.</span></span>Secondly,
 every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic
industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its
produce may be of the greatest possible value.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>421<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1210">The produce of industry is what it adds to
the subject or materials upon which it is employed. In proportion as the
 value of this produce is great or small, so will likewise be the
profits of the employer. But it is only for the sake of profit that any
man employs a capital in the support of industry; and he will always,
therefore, endeavour to employ it in the support of that industry of
which the produce is likely to be of the greatest value, or to exchange
for the greatest quantity either of money or of other goods.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1211">But the annual revenue of every society is
always precisely equal to the exchangeable value of the whole annual
produce of its industry, or rather is precisely the same thing with that
 exchangeable value. As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much
as he can both to employ his capital in the support of domestic
industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the
greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the
annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed,
neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is
 promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign
industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that
industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value,
he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases,
 led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his
intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no
part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of
the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I
 have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the
public good. It is an affectation, indeed, not very common among
merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from
it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1212">What is the species of domestic industry which his capital can employ,<span class="type-margin"><span>He can judge of this much better than the statesman.</span></span>
 and of which the produce is likely to be of the greatest value, every
individual, it is evident, can, in his local situation, judge much
better than any statesman or lawgiver can do for him. The statesman, who
 should attempt to direct private people in what manner they ought to
employ their capitals, would not only load himself with a most
unnecessary attention, but assume an authority which could safely be
trusted, not only to no single person, but to no council or senate
whatever, and which would no-where be so dangerous as in the hands of a
man who had folly and presumption enough to fancy himself fit to
exercise it.</p>

 industry, in any particular art or manufacture, is in some measure to

 capitals, and must, in almost all cases, be either a useless or a
hurtful regulation. If the produce of domestic can be brought there as
cheap as that of foreign industry, the regulation is evidently useless.
If it cannot, it must generally be hurtful. It is the maxim of every
prudent master of a family, never to attempt to make at home what it
will cost him more to make than to buy. The taylor does not attempt to
make his own shoes, but buys them of the shoemaker. The shoemaker does
not attempt to make his own clothes, but employs a taylor. The farmer
attempts to make neither the one nor the other, but employs those
different artificers. All of them find it for their interest to employ
their whole industry in a way in which they have some advantage over
their neighbours, and to purchase with a part of its produce, or what is
 the same thing, with the price of a part of it, whatever else they have
 occasion for.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1214"><span class="type-margin"><span>It is as foolish for a nation as for an individual to make what can be bought cheaper.</span></span>What
 is prudence in the conduct of every private family, can scarce be folly
 in that of a great kingdom. If a foreign country can supply us with a
commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them
with some part of the produce of our own industry, employed in a way in
which we have some advantage. The general industry of the country, being
 always in proportion to the capital which employs it, will not thereby
be diminished, no more than that of the above-mentioned artificers; but
only left to find out the way in which it can be employed with the
greatest advantage. It is certainly not employed to the greatest
advantage, when it is thus directed towards an object which it can buy
cheaper than it can make. The value of its annual produce is certainly
more or less diminished, when it is thus turned away from producing
commodities evidently of more value than the commodity which it is
directed to produce. According to the supposition, that commodity could
be purchased from foreign countries cheaper than it can be made at home.
 It could, therefore, have been purchased with a part only of the
commodities, or, what is the same thing, with a part only of the price
of the commodities, which the industry employed by an equal capital
would have produced at home, had it been left to follow its natural
course. The industry of the country, therefore, is thus turned away from
 a more, to a less advantageous employment, and the exchangeable value
of its annual produce, instead of being increased, according to the
intention of the lawgiver, must necessarily be diminished by every such
regulation.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1215"><span class="type-margin"><span>Sometimes by
such regulations a manufacture may be established earlier than it would
otherwise have been, but this would make capital accumulate slower,</span></span>By
 means of such regulations, indeed, a particular manufacture may
sometimes be acquired sooner than it could have been otherwise, and <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>423<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 after a certain time may be made at home as cheap or cheaper than in
the foreign country. But though the industry of the society may be thus
carried with advantage into a particular channel sooner than it could
have been otherwise, it will by no means follow that the sum total,
either of its industry, or of its revenue, can ever be augmented by any
such regulation. The industry of the society can augment only in
proportion as its capital augments, and its capital can augment only in
proportion to what can be gradually saved out of its revenue. But the
immediate effect of every such regulation is to diminish its revenue,
and what diminishes its revenue is certainly not very likely to augment
its capital faster than it would have augmented of its own accord, had
both capital and industry been left to find out their natural
employments.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1216">Though for want of such regulations the society should never acquire<span class="type-margin"><span>and the country might always be just as rich if it never acquired the manufacture.</span></span>
 the proposed manufacture, it would not, upon that account, necessarily
be the poorer in any one period of its duration. In every period of its
duration its whole capital and industry might still have been employed,
though upon different objects, in the manner that was most advantageous
at the time. In every period its revenue might have been the greatest
which its capital could afford, and both capital and revenue might have
been augmented<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt866" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt866_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> with the greatest possible rapidity.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1217">The natural advantages which one country has over another in<span class="type-margin"><span>No
 one proposes that a country should strive against great natural
advantages, but it is also absuid to strive against smaller advantages
whether natural or acquired.</span></span> producing particular
commodities are sometimes so great, that it is acknowledged by all the
world to be in vain to struggle with them. By means of glasses, hotbeds,
 and hotwalls, very good grapes can be raised in Scotland, and very good
 wine too can be made of them at about thirty times the expence for
which at least equally good can be brought from foreign countries. Would
 it be a reasonable law to prohibit the importation of all foreign
wines, merely to encourage the making of claret and burgundy in
Scotland? But if there would be a manifest absurdity in turning towards
any employment, thirty times more of the capital and industry of the
country, than would be necessary to purchase from foreign countries an
equal quantity of the commodities wanted, there must be an absurdity,
though not altogether so glaring, yet exactly of the same kind, in
turning towards any such employment a thirtieth, or even a three
hundredth part more of either. Whether the advantages which one country
has over another, be natural or acquired, is in this respect of no
consequence. As long as the one country has those advantages, and the
other wants them, it will always be more advantageous for the latter,
rather to buy of the former than to make. It is an acquired advantage
only, which one <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>424<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 artificer has over his neighbour, who exercises another trade; and yet
they both find it more advantageous to buy of one another, than to make
what does not belong to their particular trades.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1218"><span class="type-margin"><span>Merchants and manufacturers get the most benefit from high duties and prohibitions.</span></span>Merchants
 and manufacturers are the people who derive the greatest advantage from
 this monopoly of the home-market. The prohibition of the importation of
 foreign cattle, and of salt provisions, together with the high duties
upon foreign corn, which in times of moderate plenty amount to a
prohibition,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt867" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt867_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 are not near so advantageous to the graziers and farmers of Great
Britain, as other regulations of the same kind are to its merchants and
manufacturers. Manufactures, those of the finer kind especially, are
more easily transported from one country to another than corn or cattle.
 It is in the fetching and carrying manufactures, accordingly, that
foreign trade is chiefly employed. In manufactures, a very small
advantage will enable foreigners to undersell our own workmen, even in
the home market. It will require a very great one to enable them to do
so in the rude produce of the soil. If the free importation of foreign
manufactures were<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt868" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt868_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 permitted, several of the home manufactures would probably suffer, and
some of them, perhaps, go to ruin altogether, and a considerable part of
 the stock and industry at present employed in them, would be forced to
find out some other employment. But the freest importation of the rude
produce of the soil could have no such effect upon the agriculture of
the country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1219"><span class="type-margin"><span>The free importation of foreign cattle would make no great difference to British graziers.</span></span>If
 the importation of foreign cattle, for example, were made ever so free,
 so few could be imported, that the grazing trade of Great Britain could
 be little affected by it. Live cattle are, perhaps, the only commodity
of which the transportation is more expensive by sea than by land. By
land they carry themselves to market. By sea, not only the cattle, but
their food and their water too, must be carried at no small expence and
inconveniency. The short sea between Ireland and Great Britain, indeed,
renders the importation of Irish cattle more easy. But though the free
importation of them, which was lately permitted only for a limited time,
 were rendered perpetual, it could have no considerable effect upon the
interest of the graziers of Great Britain. Those parts of Great Britain
which border upon the Irish sea are all grazing countries. Irish cattle
could never be imported for their use, but must be drove through those
very extensive countries, at no small expence and inconveniency, before
they could arrive at their proper market. Fat cattle could not be drove
so far. Lean cattle, therefore, only could be imported, and such
importation could interfere, not with <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>425<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 the interest of the feeding or fattening countries, to which, by
reducing the price of lean cattle, it would rather be advantageous, but
with that of the breeding countries only. The small number of Irish
cattle imported since their importation was permitted, together with the
 good price at which lean cattle still continue to sell, seem to
demonstrate that even the breeding countries of Great Britain are never
likely to be much affected by the free importation of Irish cattle. The
common people of Ireland, indeed, are said to have sometimes opposed
with violence the exportation of their cattle. But if the exporters had
found any great advantage in continuing the trade, they could easily,
when the law was on their side, have conquered this mobbish opposition.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1220">Feeding and fattening countries, besides, must always be highly<span class="type-margin"><span>It might even benefit the cultivated plains at the expense of the rugged mountainous districts.</span></span>
 improved, whereas breeding countries are generally uncultivated. The
high price of lean cattle, by augmenting the value of uncultivated land,
 is like a bounty against improvement. To any country which was highly
improved throughout, it would be more advantageous to import its lean
cattle than to breed them. The province of Holland, accordingly, is said
 to follow this maxim at present. The mountains of Scotland, Wales and
Northumberland, indeed, are countries not capable of much improvement,
and seem destined by nature to be the breeding countries of Great
Britain. The freest importation of foreign cattle could have no other
effect than to hinder those breeding countries from taking advantage of
the increasing population and improvement of the rest of the kingdom,
from raising their price to an exorbitant height, and from laying a real
 tax upon all the more improved and cultivated parts of the country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1221">The freest importation of salt provisions, in the same manner, could<span class="type-margin"><span>The free importation of salt provisions also would make little difference to the graziers,</span></span>
 have as little effect upon the interest of the graziers of Great
Britain as that of live cattle. Salt provisions are not only a very
bulky commodity, but when compared with fresh meat, they are a commodity
 both of worse quality, and as they cost more labour and expence, of
higher price. They could never, therefore, come into competition with
the fresh meat, though they might with the salt provisions of the
country. They might be used for victualling ships for distant voyages,
and such like uses, but could never make any considerable part of the
food of the people. The small quantity of salt provisions imported from
Ireland since their importation was rendered free, is an experimental
proof that our graziers have nothing to apprehend from it. It does not
appear that the price of butcher’s-meat has ever been sensibly affected
by it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1222">Even the free importation of foreign corn could very little affect the<span class="type-margin"><span>and even the free importation of corn would not much affect the farmers.</span></span> interest of the farmers of Great Britain. Corn is a much more bulky <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>426<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 commodity than butcher’s-meat. A pound of wheat at a penny is as dear
as a pound of butcher’s-meat at fourpence. The small quantity of foreign
 corn imported even in times of the greatest scarcity, may satisfy our
farmers that they can have nothing to fear from the freest importation.
The average quantity imported one year with another, amounts only,
according to the very well informed author of the tracts upon the corn
trade, to twenty-three thousand seven hundred and twenty-eight quarters
of all sorts of grain, and does not exceed the five hundredth and
seventy-one part of the annual consumption.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt869" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt869_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 But as the bounty upon corn occasions a greater exportation in years of
 plenty, so it must of consequence occasion a greater importation in
years of scarcity, than in the actual state of tillage<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt870" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt870_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 would otherwise take place. By means of it, the plenty of one year does
 not compensate the scarcity of another, and as the average quantity
exported is necessarily augmented by it, so must likewise, in the actual
 state of tillage, the average quantity imported. If there were<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt871" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt871_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 no bounty, as less corn would be exported, so it is probable that, one
year with another, less would be imported than at present. The corn
merchants, the fetchers and carriers of corn between Great Britain and
foreign countries, would have much less employment, and might suffer
considerably; but the country gentlemen and farmers could suffer very
little. It is in the corn merchants accordingly, rather than in the
country gentlemen and farmers, that I have observed the greatest anxiety
 for the renewal and continuation of the bounty.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1223"><span class="type-margin"><span>Country gentlemen and farmers are less subject to the spirit of monopoly than merchants and manufacturers.</span></span>Country
 gentlemen and farmers are, to their great honour, of all people, the
least subject to the wretched spirit of monopoly. The undertaker of a
great manufactory is sometimes alarmed if another work of the same kind
is established within twenty miles of him. The Dutch undertaker of the
woollen manufacture at Abbeville<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt872" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt872_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 stipulated, that no work of the same kind should be established within
thirty leagues of that city. Farmers and country gentlemen, on the
contrary, are generally disposed rather to promote than to obstruct the
cultivation and improvement of their neighbours farms and estates. They
have no secrets, such as those of the greater part of manufacturers, but
 are generally rather fond of communicating to their neighbours, and of
extending as far as possible any new practice which they have <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>427<span class="bracket">]</span></span> found to be advantageous. <span class="ital">Pius Questus,</span> says old Cato, <span class="ital">stabilissimusque, minimeque invidiosus; minimeque male cogitantes sunt, qui in eo studio occupati sunt.</span><a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt873" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt873_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 Country gentlemen and farmers, dispersed in different parts of the
country, cannot so easily combine as merchants and manufacturers, who
being collected into towns, and accustomed to that exclusive corporation
 spirit which prevails in them, naturally endeavour to obtain against
all their countrymen, the same exclusive privilege which they generally
possess against the inhabitants of their respective towns. They
accordingly seem to have been the original inventors of those restraints
 upon the importation of foreign goods, which secure to them the
monopoly of the home-market. It was probably in imitation of them, and
to put themselves upon a level with those who, they found, were disposed
 to oppress them, that the country gentlemen and farmers of Great
Britain so far forgot the generosity which is natural to their station,
as to demand the exclusive privilege of supplying their countrymen with
corn and butcher’s-meat. They did not perhaps take time to consider, how
 much less their interest could be affected by the freedom of trade,
than that of the people whose example they followed.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1224">To prohibit by a perpetual law the importation of foreign corn and<span class="type-margin"><span>The prohibition of foreign corn and cattle restraints the population.</span></span>
 cattle, is in reality to enact, that the population and industry of the
 country shall at no time exceed what the rude produce of its own soil
can maintain.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1225">There seem, however, to be two cases in which it will generally be<span class="type-margin"><span>There are two cases which are exceptional,</span></span> advantageous to lay some burden upon foreign, for the encouragement of domestic industry.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1226">The first is, when some particular sort of industry is necessary for<span class="type-margin"><span>(1)
 when a particular industry is necessary for the defence of the country,
 like shipping, which is properly encouraged by the act of navigation,</span></span>
 the defence of the country. The defence of Great Britain, for example,
depends very much upon the number of its sailors and shipping. The act
of navigation,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt874" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt874_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 therefore, very properly endeavours to give the sailors and shipping of
 Great Britain the monopoly of the trade of their own country, in some
cases, by absolute prohibitions, and in others by heavy burdens upon the
 shipping of foreign countries. The following are the principal
dispositions of this act.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1227">First, all ships, of which the owners,
masters, and three-fourths of the mariners are not British subjects, are
 prohibited, upon pain of forfeiting ship and cargo, from trading to the
 British settlements and plantations, or from being employed in the
coasting trade of Great Britain.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt875" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt875_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>428<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1228">Secondly, a great variety of the most bulky
articles of importation can be brought into Great Britain only, either
in such ships as are above described, or in ships of the country where
those goods are produced, and of which the owners, masters, and
three-fourths of the mariners, are of that particular country; and when
imported even in ships of this latter kind, they are subject to double
aliens duty. If imported in ships of any other country, the penalty is
forfeiture of ship and goods.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt876" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt876_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 When this act was made, the Dutch were, what they still are, the great
carriers of Europe, and by this regulation they were entirely excluded
from being the carriers to Great Britain, or from importing to us the
goods of any other European country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1229">Thirdly, a great variety of the most bulky
articles of importation are prohibited from being imported, even in
British ships, from any country but that in which they are produced;
under pain of forfeiting ship and cargo.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt877" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt877_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 This regulation too was probably intended against the Dutch. Holland
was then, as now, the great emporium for all European goods, and by this
 regulation, British ships were hindered from loading in Holland the
goods of any other European country.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1230">Fourthly, salt fish of all kinds, whale-fins,
 whale-bone, oil, and blubber, not caught by and cured on board British
vessels, when imported into Great Britain, are subjected to double
aliens duty.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt878" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt878_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 The Dutch, as they are still the principal, were then the only fishers
in Europe that attempted to supply foreign nations with fish. By this
regulation, a very heavy burden was laid upon their supplying Great
Britain.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1231"><span class="type-margin"><span>a wise act, though dictated by animosity,</span></span>When
 the act of navigation was made, though England and Holland were not
actually at war, the most violent animosity subsisted between the two
nations. It had begun during the government of the long parliament,
which first framed this act,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt879" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt879_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a>
 and it broke out soon after in the Dutch wars during that of the
Protector and of Charles the Second. It is not impossible, therefore,
that some of the regulations of this famous act may have proceeded from
national animosity. They are as wise, however, as if they had all been
dictated by the most deliberate wisdom. National animosity at that
particular time aimed at the very same object which the most deliberate
wisdom would have <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>429<span class="bracket">]</span></span> recommended, the diminution of the naval power of Holland, the only naval power which could endanger the security of England.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1232">The act of navigation is not favourable to foreign commerce, or to<span class="type-margin"><span>and unfavourable to foreign commerce;</span></span>
 the growth of that opulence which can arise from it. The interest of a
nation in its commercial relations to foreign nations is, like that of a
 merchant with regard to the different people with whom he deals, to buy
 as cheap and to sell as dear as possible. But it will be most likely to
 buy cheap, when by the most perfect freedom of trade it encourages all
nations to bring to it the goods which it has occasion to purchase; and,
 for the same reason, it will be most likely to sell dear, when its
markets are thus filled with the greatest number of buyers. The act of
navigation, it is true, lays no burden upon foreign ships that come to
export the produce of British industry. Even the ancient aliens duty,
which used to be paid upon all goods exported as well as imported, has,
by several subsequent acts, been taken off from the greater part of the
articles of exportation.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt880" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt880_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 But if foreigners, either by prohibitions or high duties, are hindered
from coming to sell, they cannot always afford to come to buy; because
coming without a cargo, they must lose the freight from their own
country to Great Britain. By diminishing the number of sellers,
therefore, we necessarily diminish that of buyers, and are thus likely
not only to buy foreign goods dearer, but to sell our own cheaper, than
if there was a more perfect freedom of trade. As defence, however, is of
 much more importance than opulence, the act of navigation is, perhaps,
the wisest of all the commercial regulations of England.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1233">The second case, in which it will generally be advantageous to lay<span class="type-margin"><span>and (2) when there is a tax on the produce of the like home manufacture.</span></span>
 some burden upon foreign for the encouragement of domestic industry,
is, when some tax is imposed at home upon the produce of the latter. In
this case, it seems reasonable that an equal tax should be imposed upon
the like produce of the former. This would not give the monopoly of the
home market to domestic industry, nor turn towards a particular
employment a greater share of the stock and labour of the country, than
what would naturally go to it. It would only hinder any part of what
would naturally go to it from being turned away by the tax, into a less
natural direction, and would leave the competition between foreign and
domestic industry, after the tax, as nearly as possible upon the same
footing as before it. In Great Britain, when any such tax is laid upon
the produce of domestic industry, it is usual at the same time, in order
 to stop the clamorous complaints of our <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>430<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 merchants and manufacturers, that they will be undersold at home, to
lay a much heavier duty upon the importation of all foreign goods of the
 same kind.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1234"><span class="type-margin"><span>Some people
say that this principle justifies a general imposition of duties on
imports to counterbalance taxes levied at home on necessaries,</span></span>This
 second limitation of the freedom of trade according to some people
should, upon some occasions, be extended much farther than to the
precise foreign commodities which could come into competition with those
 which had been taxed at home. When the necessaries of life have been
taxed in any country, it becomes proper, they pretend, to tax not only
the like necessaries of life imported from other countries, but all
sorts of foreign goods which can come into competition with any thing
that is the produce of domestic industry. Subsistence, they say, becomes
 necessarily dearer in consequence of such taxes; and the price of
labour must always rise with the price of the labourers subsistence.
Every commodity, therefore, which is the produce of domestic industry,
though not immediately taxed itself, becomes dearer in consequence of
such taxes, because the labour which produces it becomes so. Such taxes,
 therefore, are really equivalent, they say, to a tax upon every
particular commodity produced at home. In order to put domestic upon the
 same footing with foreign industry, therefore, it becomes necessary,
they think, to lay some duty upon every foreign commodity, equal to this
 enhancement of the price of the home commodities with which it can come
 into competition.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1235"><span class="type-margin"><span>but there is a difference,</span></span>Whether taxes upon the necessaries of life, such as those in Great Britain upon<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt881" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt881_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 soap, salt, leather, candles, &amp;c. necessarily raise the price of
labour, and consequently that of all other commodities, I shall consider
 hereafter,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt882" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt882_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 when I come to treat of taxes. Supposing, however, in the mean time,
that they have this effect, and they have it undoubtedly, this general
enhancement of the price of all commodities, in consequence of that of
labour, is a case which differs in the two following respects from that
of a particular commodity, of which the price was enhanced by a
particular tax immediately imposed upon it.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1236"><span class="type-margin"><span>since (<span class="ital">a</span>) the effect of taxes on necessaries cannot be exactly known,</span></span>First,
 it might always be known with great exactness how far the price of such
 a commodity could be enhanced by such a tax: but how far the general
enhancement of the price of labour might affect that of every different
commodity about which labour was employed, could never be known with any
 tolerable exactness. It would be impossible, therefore, to proportion
with any tolerable exactness the tax upon every foreign, to this
enhancement of the price of every home commodity.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>431<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1237">Secondly, taxes upon the necessaries of life have nearly the same<span class="type-margin"><span>and (<span class="ital">b</span>) taxes on necessaries are like poor soil or bad climate: they cannot justify an attempt to give capital an unnatural direction.</span></span>
 effect upon the circumstances of the people as a poor soil and a bad
climate. Provisions are thereby rendered dearer in the same manner as if
 it required extraordinary labour and expence to raise them. As in the
natural scarcity arising from soil and climate, it would be absurd to
direct the people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals and
 industry, so is it<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt883" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt883_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 likewise in the artificial scarcity arising from such taxes. To be left
 to accommodate, as well as they could, their industry to their
situation, and to find out those employments in which, notwithstanding
their unfavourable circumstances, they might have some advantage either
in the home or in the foreign market, is what in both cases would
evidently be most for their advantage. To lay a new tax upon them,
because they are already overburdened with taxes, and because they
already pay too dear for the necessaries of life, to make them likewise
pay too dear for the greater part of other commodities, is certainly a
most absurd way of making amends.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1238">Such taxes, when they have grown up to a certain height, are a curse<span class="type-margin"><span>Taxes on necessaries are commonest in the richest countries because no others could support them</span></span>
 equal to the barrenness of the earth and the inclemency of the heavens;
 and yet it is in the richest and most industrious countries that they
have been most generally imposed. No other countries could support so
great a disorder. As the strongest bodies only can live and enjoy
health, under an unwholesome regimen; so the nations only, that in every
 sort of industry have the greatest natural and acquired advantages, can
 subsist and prosper under such taxes. Holland is the country in Europe
in which they abound most, and which from peculiar circumstances
continues to prosper, not by means of them, as has been most absurdly
supposed, but in spite of them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1239">As there are two cases in which it will generally be advantageous to<span class="type-margin"><span>There are two other possible exceptions to the general principle</span></span>
 lay some burden upon foreign, for the encouragement of domestic
industry; so there are two others in which it may sometimes be a matter
of deliberation; in the one, how far it is proper to continue the free
importation of certain foreign goods; and in the other, how far, or in
what manner, it may be proper to restore that free importation after it
has been for some time interrupted.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1240">The case in which it may sometimes be a matter of deliberation how<span class="type-margin"><span>(1) Retaliation</span></span>
 far it is proper to continue the free importation of certain foreign
goods, is, when some foreign nation restrains by high duties or
prohibitions the importation of some of our manufactures into their
country. Revenge in this case naturally dictates retaliation, and that
we should impose the like duties and prohibitions upon the importation
of some or all <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>432<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 of their manufactures into ours. Nations accordingly seldom fail to
retaliate in this manner. The French have been particularly forward to
favour their own manufactures by restraining the importation of such
foreign goods as could come into competition with them. In this
consisted a great part of the policy of Mr. Colbert, who,
notwithstanding his great abilities, seems in this case to have been
imposed upon by the sophistry of merchants and manufacturers, who are
always demanding a monopoly against their countrymen. It is at present
the opinion of the most intelligent men in France that his operations of
 this kind have not been beneficial to his country. That minister, by
the tarif of 1667, imposed very high duties upon a great number of
foreign manufactures. Upon his refusing to moderate them in favour of
the Dutch, they in 1671 prohibited the importation of the wines,
brandies and manufactures of France. The war of 1672 seems to have been
in part occasioned by this commercial dispute. The peace of Nimeguen put
 an end to it in 1678, by moderating some of those duties in favour of
the Dutch, who in consequence took off their prohibition. It was about
the same time that the French and English began mutually to oppress each
 other’s industry, by the like duties and prohibitions, of which the
French, however, seem to have set the first example. The spirit of
hostility which has subsisted between the two nations ever since, has
hitherto hindered them from being moderated on either side. In 1697 the
English prohibited the importation of bonelace, the manufacture of
Flanders. The government of that country, at that time under the
dominion of Spain, prohibited in return the importation of English
woollens. In 1700, the prohibition of importing bonelace into England,
was taken off upon condition that the importation of English woollens
into Flanders should be put on the same footing as before.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt884" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt884_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1241"><span class="type-margin"><span>may be good policy where it is likely to secure the abolition of foreign restraints.</span></span>There
 may be good policy in retaliations of this kind, when there is a
probability that they will procure the repeal of the high duties or
prohibitions complained of. The recovery of a great foreign market will
generally more than compensate the transitory inconveniency of paying
dearer during a short time for some sorts of goods. To judge whether
such retaliations are likely to produce such an effect, does not,
perhaps, belong so much to the science of a legislator, whose
deliberations ought to be governed by general principles which are
always the same, as to the skill of that insidious and crafty animal,
vulgarly called a statesman or politician, whose councils are directed
by the momentary <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>433<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 fluctuations of affairs. When there is no probability that any such
repeal can be procured, it seems a bad method of compensating the injury
 done to certain classes of our people, to do another injury ourselves,
not only to those classes, but to<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt885" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt885_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 almost all the other classes of them. When our neighbours prohibit some
 manufacture of ours, we generally prohibit, not only the same, for that
 alone would seldom affect them considerably, but some other manufacture
 of theirs. This may no doubt give encouragement to some particular
class of workmen among ourselves, and by excluding some of their rivals,
 may enable them to raise their price in the home-market. Those workmen,
 however, who suffered by our neighbours prohibition will not be
benefited by ours. On the contrary, they and almost all the other
classes of our citizens will thereby be obliged to pay dearer than
before for certain goods. Every such law, therefore, imposes a real tax
upon the whole country, not in favour of that particular class of
workmen who were injured by our neighbours prohibition, but of some
other class.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1242">The case in which it may sometimes be a matter of deliberation, how<span class="type-margin"><span>(2) It may be desirable to introduce freedom of trade by slow gradations.</span></span>
 far, or in what manner, it is proper to restore the free importation of
 foreign goods, after it has been for some time interrupted, is, when
particular manufactures, by means of high duties or prohibitions upon
all foreign goods which can come into competition with them, have been
so far extended as to employ a great multitude of hands. Humanity may in
 this case require that the freedom of trade should be restored only by
slow gradations, and with a good deal of reserve and circumspection.
Were those high duties and prohibitions taken away all at once, cheaper
foreign goods of the same kind might be poured so fast into the home
market, as to deprive all at once many thousands<span class="type-margin"><span>But the disorder occasioned by its sudden introduction would be less than is supposed since</span></span>
 of our people of their ordinary employment and means of subsistence.
The disorder which this would occasion might no doubt be very
considerable. It would in all probability, however, be much less than is
 commonly imagined, for the two following reasons:</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1243">First, all those manufactures, of which any
part is commonly exported to other European countries without a bounty,
could be very little affected by the freest importation of foreign
goods. Such manufactures must be sold as cheap abroad as any other
foreign goods of the same quality and kind,<span class="type-margin"><span>(<span class="ital">a</span>) no manufacture which is now exported would be affected;</span></span>
 and consequently must be sold cheaper at home. They would still,
therefore, keep possession of the home market, and though a capricious
man of fashion might sometimes prefer foreign wares, merely because they
 were foreign, to cheaper and better goods of the same kind that were
made at home, this folly could, from the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>434<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 nature of things, extend to so few, that it could make no sensible
impression upon the general employment of the people. But a great part
of all the different branches of our woollen manufacture, of our tanned
leather, and of our hard-ware, are annually exported to other European
countries without any bounty, and these are the manufactures which
employ the greatest number of hands. The silk, perhaps, is the
manufacture which would suffer the most by this freedom of trade, and
after it the linen, though the latter much less than the former.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1244"><span class="type-margin"><span>(<span class="ital">b</span>) the people thrown out of one employment would easily find another,</span></span>Secondly,
 though a great number of people should, by thus restoring the freedom
of trade, be thrown all at once out of their ordinary employment and
common method of subsistence, it would by no means follow that they
would thereby be deprived either of employment or subsistence. By the
reduction of the army and navy at the end of the late war, more than a
hundred thousand soldiers and seamen, a number equal to what is employed
 in the greatest manufactures, were all at once thrown out of their
ordinary employment; but, though they no doubt suffered some
inconveniency, they were not thereby deprived of all employment and
subsistence. The greater part of the seamen, it is probable, gradually
betook themselves to the merchant-service as they could find occasion,
and in the meantime both they and the soldiers were absorbed in the
great mass of the people, and employed in a great variety of
occupations. Not only no great convulsion, but no sensible disorder
arose from so great a change in the situation of more than a hundred
thousand men, all accustomed to the use of arms, and many of them to
rapine and plunder. The number of vagrants was scarce any-where sensibly
 increased by it, even the wages of labour were not reduced by it in any
 occupation, so far as I have been able to learn, except in that of
seamen in the merchant-service. But if we compare together the habits of
 a soldier and of any sort of manufacturer, we shall find that those of
the latter do not tend so much to disqualify him from being employed in a
 new trade, as those of the former from being employed in any. The
manufacturer has always been accustomed to look for his subsistence from
 his labour only: the soldier to expect it from his pay. Application and
 industry have been familiar to the one; idleness and dissipation to the
 other. But it is surely much easier to change the direction of industry
 from one sort of labour to another, than to turn idleness and
dissipation to any. To the greater part of manufactures besides, it has
already been observed,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt886" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt886_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 there are other collateral manufactures of so similar a nature, that a
workman can easily transfer his industry from one of them to another.
The <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>435<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 greater part of such workmen too are occasionally employed in country
labour. The stock which employed them in a particular manufacture
before, will still remain in the country to employ an equal number of
people in some other way. The capital of the country remaining the same,
 the demand for labour will likewise be the same, or very nearly the
same, though it may be exerted in different places and for different
occupations. Soldiers and seamen, indeed, when discharged from the
king’s service, are at liberty to exercise any trade, within any town or
 place of Great Britain or Ireland.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt887" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt887_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> Let the same natural liberty of<span class="type-margin"><span>especially if the privileges of corporations and the law of settlement were abolished.</span></span>
 exercising what species of industry they please, be restored to all his
 majesty’s subjects, in the same manner as to soldiers and seamen; that
is, break down the exclusive privileges of corporations, and repeal the
statute of apprenticeship, both which are real encroachments upon
natural liberty, and add to these the repeal of the law of settlements,
so that a poor workman, when thrown out of employment either in one
trade or in one place, may seek for it in another trade or in another
place, without the fear either of a prosecution or of a removal, and
neither the public nor the individuals will suffer much more from the
occasional disbanding some particular classes of manufacturers, than
from that of soldiers. Our manufacturers have no doubt great merit with
their country, but they cannot have more than those who defend it with
their blood, nor deserve to be treated with more delicacy.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1245">To expect, indeed, that the freedom of trade should ever be entirely<span class="type-margin"><span>Private interests are too strong to allow of the restoration of freedom of trade in Great Britain.</span></span> restored in Great Britain, is as absurd as to expect that an Oceana or Utopia<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt888" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt888_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 should ever be established in it. Not only the prejudices of the
public, but what is much more unconquerable, the private interests of
many individuals, irresistibly oppose it. Were the officers of the army
to oppose with the same zeal and unanimity any reduction in the number
of forces, with which master manufacturers set themselves against every
law that is likely to increase the number of their rivals in the home
market; were the former to animate their soldiers, in the same manner as
 the latter enflame their workmen, to attack with violence and outrage
the proposers of any such regulation; to attempt to reduce the army
would be as dangerous as it has now become to attempt to diminish in any
 respect the monopoly which our manufacturers have obtained against us.
This monopoly has so much increased the number of some particular tribes
 of them, that, like an overgrown standing army, they have become
formidable to the government, and upon many <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>436<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 occasions intimidate the legislature. The member of parliament who
supports every proposal for strengthening this monopoly, is sure to
acquire not only the reputation of understanding trade, but great
popularity and influence with an order of men whose numbers and wealth
render them of great importance. If he opposes them, on the contrary,
and still more if he has authority enough to be able to thwart them,
neither the most acknowledged probity, nor the highest rank, nor the
greatest public services, can protect him from the most infamous abuse
and detraction, from personal insults, nor sometimes from real danger,
arising from the insolent outrage of furious and disappointed
monopolists.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1246"><span class="type-margin"><span>The fact that
 equitable regard is due to the manufacturer who has fixed capital in
his business is an argument against the establishment of new monopolies.</span></span>The
 undertaker of a great manufacture, who, by the home markets being
suddenly laid open to the competition of foreigners, should be obliged
to abandon his trade, would no doubt suffer very considerably. That part
 of his capital which had usually been employed in purchasing materials
and in paying his workmen, might, without much difficulty, perhaps, find
 another employment. But that part of it which was fixed in workhouses,
and in the instruments of trade, could scarce be disposed of without
considerable loss. The equitable regard, therefore, to his interest
requires that changes of this kind should never be introduced suddenly,
but slowly, gradually, and after a very long warning. The legislature,
were it possible that its deliberations could be always directed, not by
 the clamorous importunity of partial interests, but by an extensive
view of the general good, ought upon this very account, perhaps, to be
particularly careful neither to establish any new monopolies of this
kind, nor to extend further those which are already established. Every
such regulation introduces some degree of real disorder into the
constitution of the state, which it will be difficult afterwards to cure
 without occasioning another disorder.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1247"><span class="type-margin"><span>Customs duties imposed for revenue remain to be considered hereafter</span></span>How
 far it may be proper to impose taxes upon the importation of foreign
goods, in order, not to prevent their importation, but to raise a

 Taxes imposed with a view to prevent, or even to diminish importation,
are evidently as destructive of the revenue of the customs as of the
freedom of trade.</p>

 almost all kinds, from those particular countries with which the
balance of trade is supposed to be disadvantageous, is the second
expedient by which the commercial system proposes to increase the
quantity of gold and silver. Thus in Great Britain, Silesia lawns may be
 imported for home consumption, upon paying certain duties. But French
cambrics and lawns are prohibited to be imported, except into the port
of London, there to be warehoused for exportation.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt891" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt891_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 Higher duties are imposed upon the wines of France than upon those of
Portugal, or indeed of any other country. By what is called the impost
1692,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt892" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt892_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 a duty of five and twenty per cent., of the rate or value, was laid
upon all French goods; while the goods of other nations were, the
greater part of them, subjected to much lighter duties, seldom exceeding
 five per cent. The wine, brandy, salt and vinegar of France were indeed
 excepted; these commodities being subjected to other heavy duties,
either by other laws, or by particular clauses of the same law. In 1696,
 a second duty of twenty-five per cent., the first not having been
thought a sufficient discouragement, was imposed upon all French goods,
except brandy; together with a new duty of five and twenty pounds upon
the ton of French wine, and another of fifteen pounds upon the ton of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>438<span class="bracket">]</span></span> French vinegar.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt893" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt893_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 French goods have never been omitted in any of those general subsidies,
 or duties of five per cent., which have been imposed upon all, or the
greater part of the goods enumerated in the book of rates. If we count
the one third and two third subsidies as making a complete subsidy
between them, there have been five of these general subsidies;<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt894" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt894_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 so that before the commencement of the present war seventy-five per
cent. may be considered as the lowest duty, to which the greater part of
 the goods of the growth, produce, or manufacture of France were liable.
 But upon the greater part of goods, those duties are equivalent to a
prohibition. The French in their turn have, I believe, treated our goods
 and manufactures just as hardly; though I am not so well acquainted
with the particular hardships which they have imposed upon them. Those
mutual restraints have put an end to almost all fair commerce between
the two nations, and smugglers are now the principal importers, either
of British goods into France, or of French goods into Great Britain. The
 principles which I have been examining in the foregoing chapter took
their origin from private interest and the spirit of monopoly;<span class="type-margin"><span>Such restraints are unreasonable on the principles of the mercantile system, since</span></span> those which I am going to examine in this, from national prejudice and animosity.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt895" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt895_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 They are, accordingly, as might well be expected, still more
unreasonable. They are so, even upon the principles of the commercial
system.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1249"><span class="type-margin"><span>(1) if free trade with France did lead to an unfavourable balance with France, it might yet not do so with the world in general,</span></span>First,
 though it were certain that in the case of a free trade between France
and England, for example, the balance would be in favour of France, it
would by no means follow that such a trade would be disadvantageous to
England, or that the general balance of its whole trade would thereby be
 turned more against it. If the wines of France are better and cheaper
than those of Portugal, or its linens than those of Germany, it would be
 more advantageous for Great Britain to purchase both the wine and the
foreign linen which it had occasion for of France, than of Portugal and
Germany. Though the value of the annual importations from France would
thereby be greatly augmented, the value of the whole annual importations
 would be diminished, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>439<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 in proportion as the French goods of the same quality were cheaper than
 those of the other two countries. This would be the case, even upon the
 supposition that the whole French goods imported were to be consumed in
 Great Britain.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1250">But, secondly, a great part of them might be re-exported to other<span class="type-margin"><span>(2) a part of French imports might be re-exported and bring back gold and silver,</span></span>
 countries, where, being sold with profit, they might bring back a
return equal in value, perhaps, to the prime cost of the whole French
goods imported. What has frequently been said of the East India trade<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt896" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt896_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 might possibly be true of the French; that though the greater part of
East India goods were bought with gold and silver, the re-exportation of
 a part of them to other countries, brought back more gold and silver to
 that which carried on the trade than the prime cost of the whole
amounted to. One of the most important branches of the Dutch trade, at
present, consists in the carriage of French goods to other European
countries. Some part<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt897" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt897_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 even of the French wine drank in Great Britain is clandestinely
imported from Holland and Zealand. If there was either a free trade
between France and England, or if French goods could be imported upon
paying only the same duties as those of other European nations, to be
drawn back upon exportation, England might have some share of a trade
which is found so advantageous to Holland.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1251">Thirdly, and lastly, there is no certain criterion by which we can<span class="type-margin"><span>and (3) the balance cannot be certainly known:</span></span>
 determine on which side what is called the balance between any two
countries lies, or which of them exports to the greatest value. National
 prejudice and animosity, prompted always by the private interest of
particular traders, are the principles which generally direct our
judgment upon all questions concerning it. There are two criterions,
however, which have frequently been appealed to upon such occasions, the
 custom-house books and the course of exchange. The custom-house<span class="type-margin"><span>custom-house books are useless,</span></span>
 books, I think, it is now generally acknowledged, are a very uncertain
criterion, on account of the inaccuracy of the valuation at which the
greater part of goods are rated in them. The course of exchange<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt898" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt898_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> is, perhaps, almost equally so.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1252"><span class="type-margin"><span>and the course of exchange is little better.</span></span>When
 the exchange between two places, such as London and Paris, is at par,
it is said to be a sign that the debts due from London to Paris are
compensated by those due from Paris to London. On the contrary, when a
premium is paid at London for a bill upon Paris, it is said to be a sign
 that the debts due from London to Paris are not compensated <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>440<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 by those due from Paris to London, but that a balance in money must be
sent out from the latter place; for the risk, trouble, and expence of
exporting which, the premium is both demanded and given. But the
ordinary state of debt and credit between those two cities must
necessarily be regulated, it is said, by the ordinary course of their
dealings with one another. When neither of them imports from the other
to a greater amount than it exports to that other, the debts and credits
 of each may compensate one another. But when one of them imports from
the other to a greater value than it exports to that other,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt899" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt899_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 the former necessarily becomes indebted to the latter in a greater sum
than the latter becomes indebted to it: the debts and credits of each do
 not compensate one another, and money must be sent out from that place
of which the debts over-balance the credits. The ordinary<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt900" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt900_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 course of exchange, therefore, being an indication of the ordinary
state of debt and credit between two places, must likewise be an
indication of the ordinary course of their exports and imports, as these
 necessarily regulate that state.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1253"><span class="type-margin"><span>A favourable exchange with a particular country does not prove a favourable balance with that country.</span></span>But
 though the ordinary course of exchange should be allowed to be a
sufficient indication of the ordinary state of debt and credit between
any two places, it would not from thence follow, that the balance of
trade was in favour of that place which had the ordinary state of debt
and credit in its favour. The ordinary state of debt and credit between
any two places is not always entirely regulated by the ordinary course
of their dealings with one another; but is often influenced by that of
the dealings of either with many other places. If it is usual, for
example, for the merchants of England to pay for the goods which they
buy of Hamburgh, Dantzic, Riga, &amp;c. by bills upon Holland, the
ordinary state of debt and credit between England and Holland will not
be regulated entirely by the ordinary course of the dealings of those
two countries with one another, but will be influenced by that of the
dealings of England with those other places. England may be obliged to
send out every year money to Holland, though its annual exports to that
country may exceed very much the annual value of its imports from
thence; and though what is called the balance of trade may be very much
in favour of England.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt901" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt901_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1254"><span class="type-margin"><span>Besides, the ordinary computation of exchange is often misleading, since</span></span>In
 the way, besides, in which the par of exchange has hitherto been
computed, the ordinary course of exchange can afford no sufficient
indication that the ordinary state of debt and credit is in favour of
that <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>441<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 country which seems to have, or which is supposed to have, the ordinary
 course of exchange in its favour: or, in other words, the real exchange
 may be, and, in fact, often is so very different from the computed one,
 that from the course of the latter, no certain conclusion can, upon
many occasions, be drawn concerning that of the former.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt902" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt902_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1255">When for a sum of money paid in England,

to be at par between England and France. When you pay more, you are

premium, and exchange is said to be against France, and in favour of
England.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1256">But, first, we cannot always judge of the value of the current money<span class="type-margin"><span>(1) money is often below its nominal standard,</span></span> of different countries by the standard<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt903" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt903_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 of their respective mints. In some it is more, in others it is less
worn, clipt, and otherwise degenerated from that standard. But the value
 of the current coin of every country, compared with that of any other
country, is in proportion not to the quantity of pure silver which it
ought to contain, but to that which it actually does contain. Before the
 reformation of the silver coin in king William’s time, exchange between
 England and Holland, computed, in the usual manner, according to the
standard of their respective mints, was five and twenty per cent.
against England. But the value of the current coin of England, as we
learn from Mr. Lowndes, was at that time rather more than five and
twenty per cent. below its standard value.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt904" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt904_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a>
 The real exchange, therefore, may even at that time have been in favour
 of England, notwithstanding the computed exchange was so much against
it; a smaller number of ounces of pure silver, actually paid in England,
 may have purchased a bill for a greater number of ounces of pure silver
 to be paid in Holland, and the man who was supposed to give, may in
reality have got the premium. The French coin was, before the late
reformation of the English gold coin, much less worn than the English,
and was, perhaps, two or three per cent. nearer its standard. If the
computed exchange with France, therefore, was not more than two or three
 per cent. against England, the real exchange might have been in its
favour. <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>442<span class="bracket">]</span></span> Since the reformation of the gold coin, the exchange has been constantly in favour of England, and against France.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1257"><span class="type-margin"><span>(2) coin is sometimes raised by seignorage above the value of the bullion contained in it,</span></span>Secondly,
 in some countries, the expence of coinage is defrayed by the
government; in others, it is defrayed by the private people who carry
their bullion to the mint, and the government even derives some revenue
from the coinage. In England, it is defrayed by the government, and if
you carry a pound weight of standard silver to the mint, you get back
sixty-two shillings, containing a pound weight of the like standard
silver. In France, a duty of eight per cent. is deducted for the
coinage, which not only defrays the expence of it, but affords a small
revenue to the government.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt905" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt905_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 In England, as the coinage costs nothing, the current coin can never be
 much more valuable than the quantity of bullion which it actually
contains. In France, the workmanship, as you pay for it, adds to the
value, in the same manner as to that of wrought plate. A sum of French
money, therefore, containing a certain weight of pure silver, is more
valuable than a sum of English money containing an equal weight of pure
silver, and must require more bullion, or other commodities, to purchase
 it. Though the current coin of the two countries, therefore, were
equally near the standards of their respective mints, a sum of English
money could not well purchase a sum of French money, containing an equal
 number of ounces of pure silver, nor consequently a bill upon France
for such a sum. If for such a bill no more additional money was paid
than what was sufficient to compensate the expence of the French
coinage, the real exchange might be at par between the two countries,
their debts and credits might mutually compensate one another, while the
 computed exchange was considerably in favour of France. If less than
this was paid, the real exchange might be in favour of England, while
the computed was in favour of France.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1258"><span class="type-margin"><span>and (3) bank money bears an agio.</span></span>Thirdly,
 and lastly, in some places, as at Amsterdam, Hamburgh, Venice, &amp;c.
foreign bills of exchange are paid in what they call bank money; while
in others, as at London, Lisbon, Antwerp, Leghorn, &amp;c. they are paid
 in the common currency of the country. What is called bank money is
always of more value than the same nominal sum of common currency. A
thousand guilders in the bank of Amsterdam, for example, are of more
value than a thousand guilders of Amsterdam currency. The difference
between them is called the agio of the bank,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt906" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt906_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> which, at Amsterdam, is generally about five per cent. Supposing the current <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>443<span class="bracket">]</span></span> money of two<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt907" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt907_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 countries equally near to the standard of their respective mints, and
that the one pays foreign bills in this common currency, while the other
 pays them in bank money, it is evident that the computed exchange may
be in favour of that which pays in bank money, though the real exchange
should be in favour of that which pays in current money; for the same
reason that the computed exchange may be in favour of that which pays in
 better money, or in money nearer to its own standard, though the real
exchange should be in favour of that which pays in worse. The computed
exchange, before the late reformation of the gold coin, was generally
against London with Amsterdam, Hamburgh, Venice, and, I believe, with
all other places which pay in what is called bank money. It will by no
means follow, however, that the real exchange was against it. Since the
reformation of the gold coin, it has been in favour of London even with
those places. The computed exchange has generally been in favour of
London with Lisbon, Antwerp, Leghorn, and, if you except France, I
believe, with most other parts of Europe that pay in common currency;
and it is not improbable that the real exchange was so too.</p>

<p class="indent-no" id="Smith_0206-01_1259">THE currency of a great state, such as France or England, generally<span class="type-margin"><span>Small states must admit foreign coin, which is of uncertain value.</span></span>
 consists almost entirely of its own coin. Should this currency,
therefore, be at any time worn, clipt, or otherwise degraded below its
standard value, the state by a reformation of its coin can effectually
re-establish its currency. But the currency of a small state, such as
Genoa or Hamburgh, can seldom consist altogether in its own coin, but
must be made up, in a great measure, of the coins of all the
neighbouring states with which its inhabitants have a continual
intercourse. Such a state, therefore, by reforming its coin, will not
always be able to reform its currency. If foreign bills of exchange are
paid in this currency, the uncertain value of any sum, of what is in its
 own nature so uncertain, must render the exchange always very much
against such a state, its currency being, in all foreign states,
necessarily valued even below what it is worth.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1260">In order to remedy the inconvenience to which this disadvantageous<span class="type-margin"><span>Banks are then established to pay in standard money regardless of the condition of the coin, and this money bears an agio.</span></span>
 exchange must have subjected their merchants, such small states, when
they began to attend to the interest of trade, have frequently enacted, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>444<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 that foreign bills of exchange of a certain value should be paid, not
in common currency, but by an order upon, or by a transfer in the books
of a certain bank, established upon the credit, and under the protection
 of the state; this bank being always obliged to pay, in good and true
money, exactly according to the standard of the state. The banks of
Venice, Genoa, Amsterdam, Hamburgh, and Nuremberg, seem to have been all
 originally established with this view, though some of them may have
afterwards been made subservient to other purposes. The money of such
banks being better than the common currency of the country, necessarily
bore an agio, which was greater or smaller, according as the currency
was supposed to be more or less degraded below the standard of the
state. The agio of the bank of Hamburgh, for example, which is said to
be commonly about fourteen per cent. is the supposed difference between
the good standard money of the state, and the clipt, worn, and
diminished currency poured into it from all the neighbouring states.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1261"><span class="type-margin"><span>Before 1609 the common currency of Amsterdam was 9 per cent. below the standard.</span></span>Before
 1609 the great quantity of clipt and worn foreign coin, which the
extensive trade of Amsterdam brought from all parts of Europe, reduced
the value of its currency about nine per cent. below that of good money
fresh from the mint. Such money no sooner appeared than it was melted
down or carried away, as it always is in such circumstances. The
merchants, with plenty of currency, could not always find a sufficient
quantity of good money to pay their bills of exchange; and the value of
those bills, in spite of several regulations which were made to prevent
it, became in a great measure uncertain.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1262"><span class="type-margin"><span>The bank was then established to receive and pay coin at its intrinsic value in good standard money.</span></span>In
 order to remedy these inconveniencies, a bank was established in 1609
under the guarantee of the city. This bank received both foreign coin,
and the light and worn coin of the country at its real intrinsic value
in the good standard money of the country, deducting only so much as was
 necessary for defraying the expence of coinage, and the other necessary
 expence of management. For the value which remained, after this small
deduction was made, it gave a credit in its books. This credit was
called bank money, which, as it represented money exactly according to
the standard of the mint, was always of the same real value, and
intrinsically worth more than current money. It was at the same time
enacted, that all bills drawn upon or negotiated at Amsterdam of the
value of six hundred guilders and upwards should be paid in bank money,
which at once took away all uncertainty in the value of those bills.
Every merchant, in consequence of this regulation, was obliged to keep
an account with the bank in order to <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>445<span class="bracket">]</span></span> pay his foreign bills of exchange, which necessarily occasioned a certain demand for bank money.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1263">Bank money, over and above both its intrinsic superiority to currency,<span class="type-margin"><span>Money in the bank was not only up to the standard, but also secure and easily transferred, so that it bore an agio.</span></span>
 and the additional value which this demand necessarily gives it, has
likewise some other advantages. It is secure from fire, robbery, and
other accidents; the city of Amsterdam is bound for it; it can be paid
away by a simple transfer, without the trouble of counting, or the risk
of transporting it from one place to another. In consequence of those
different advantages, it seems from the beginning to have borne an agio,
 and it is generally believed that all the money originally deposited in
 the bank was allowed to remain there, nobody caring to demand payment
of a debt which he could sell for a premium in the market. By demanding
payment of the bank, the owner of a bank credit would lose this premium.
 As a shilling fresh from the mint will buy no more goods in the market
than one of our common worn shillings, so the good and true money which
might be brought from the coffers of the bank into those of a private
person, being mixed and confounded with the common currency of the
country, would be of no more value than that currency, from which it
could no longer be readily distinguished. While it remained in the
coffers of the bank, its superiority was known and ascertained. When it
had come into those of a private person, its superiority could not well
be ascertained without more trouble than perhaps the difference was
worth. By being brought from the coffers of the bank, besides, it lost
all the other advantages of bank money; its security, its easy and safe
transferability, its use in paying foreign bills of exchange. Over and
above all this, it could not be brought from those coffers, as it will
appear by and by, without previously paying for the keeping.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1264">Those deposits of coin, or those deposits which<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt909" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt909_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> the bank was bound<span class="type-margin"><span>The bank receives bullion as well as coin, giving in exchange a credit in bank money to 95 per cent of the value.</span></span>
 to restore in coin, constituted the original capital of the bank, or
the whole value of what was represented by what is called bank money. At
 present they are supposed to constitute but a very small part of it. In
 order to facilitate the trade in bullion, the bank has been for these
many years in the practice of giving credit in its books upon deposits
of gold and silver bullion. This credit is generally about five per
cent. below the mint price of such bullion. The bank grants at the same
time what is called a recipice or receipt, intitling the person who
makes the deposit, or the bearer,<span class="type-margin"><span>It also
 gives a receipt which entitles the bearer to recover the bullion on
repaying the sum advanced and paying ¼ per cent. for silver and ½ per
cent. for gold.</span></span> to take out the bullion again at any time
within six months, upon retransferring to the bank a quantity of bank
money equal to that for which credit had been given in its books <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>446<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 when the deposit was made, and upon paying one-fourth per cent. for the
 keeping, if the deposit was in silver; and one-half per cent. if it was
 in gold; but at the same time declaring, that in default of such
payment, and upon the expiration of this term, the deposit should belong
 to the bank at the price at which it had been received, or for which
credit had been given in the transfer books. What is thus paid for the
keeping of the deposit may be considered as a sort of warehouse rent;
and why this warehouse rent should be so much dearer for gold than for
silver, several different reasons have been assigned. The fineness of
gold, it has been said, is more difficult to be ascertained than that of
 silver. Frauds are more easily practised, and occasion a greater loss
in the more precious metal. Silver, besides, being the standard metal,
the state, it has been said, wishes to encourage more the making of
deposits of silver than those of gold.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt910" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt910_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1265"><span class="type-margin"><span>The receipts are generally worth something, and are renewed at the end of each six months.</span></span>Deposits
 of bullion are most commonly made when the price is somewhat lower than
 ordinary; and they are taken out again when it happens to rise. In
Holland the market price of bullion is generally above the mint price,
for the same reason that it was so in England before the late
reformation of the gold coin. The difference is said to be commonly from
 about six to sixteen stivers upon the mark, or eight ounces of silver
of eleven parts fine, and one part alloy. The bank price, or the credit
which the bank gives for deposits of such silver (when made in foreign
coin, of which the fineness is well known and ascertained, such as
Mexico dollars), is twenty-two guilders the mark; the mint price is
about twenty-three guilders, and the market price is from twenty-three
guilders six, to twenty-three guilders sixteen stivers, or from two to
three per cent. above the mint price.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt911" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt911_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> The proportions <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>447<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 between the bank price, the mint price, and the market price of gold
bullion, are nearly the same. A person can generally sell his receipt
for the difference between the mint price of bullion and the market
price. A receipt for bullion is almost always worth something, and it
very seldom happens, therefore, that any body suffers his receipt to
expire, or allows his bullion to fall to the bank at the price at which
it had been received, either by not taking it out before the end of the
six months, or by neglecting to pay the one-fourth or one-half per cent.
 in order to obtain a new receipt for another six months. This, however,
 though it happens seldom, is said to happen sometimes, and more
frequently with regard to gold, than with regard to silver, on account
of the higher warehouse-rent which is paid for the keeping of the more
precious metal.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1266">The person who by making a deposit of bullion obtains both a bank<span class="type-margin"><span>The depositor usually parts with his receipt.</span></span>
 credit and a receipt, pays his bills of exchange as they become due
with his bank credit; and either sells or keeps his receipt according as
 he judges that the price of bullion is likely to rise or to fall. The
receipt and the bank credit seldom keep long together, and there is no
occasion that they should. The person who has a receipt, and who wants
to take out bullion, finds always plenty of bank credits, or bank money
to buy at the ordinary price; and the person who has bank money, and
wants to take out bullion, finds receipts always in equal abundance.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1267">The owners of bank credits, and the holders of receipts, constitute<span class="type-margin"><span>The bank money and the receipt together equal in value the bullion deposited.</span></span>
 two different sorts of creditors against the bank. The holder of a
receipt cannot draw out the bullion for which it is granted, without
re-assigning to the bank a sum of bank money equal to the price at which
 the bullion had been received. If he has no bank money of his own, he
must purchase it of those who have it. The owner of bank money cannot
draw out bullion without producing to the bank receipts for the quantity
 which he wants. If he has none of his own, he must buy them of those
who have them. The holder of a receipt, when he purchases bank money,
purchases the power of taking out a quantity of bullion, of which the
mint price is five per cent. above the bank price. The agio of five per
cent. therefore, which he commonly pays for it, is paid, not for an
imaginary, but for a real value. The owner of bank money, when he
purchases a receipt, purchases the power of taking out a quantity of
bullion of which the market price is commonly <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>448<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 from two to three per cent. above the mint price. The price which he
pays for it, therefore, is paid likewise for a real value. The price of
the receipt, and the price of the bank money, compound or make up
between them the full value or price of the bullion.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1268"><span class="type-margin"><span>Receipts for current coin are also given, but these are often of no value and are allowed to expire.</span></span>Upon
 deposits of the coin current in the country, the bank grants receipts
likewise as well as bank credits; but those receipts are frequently of
no value, and will bring no price in the market. Upon ducatoons, for
example, which in the currency pass for three guilders three stivers
each, the bank gives a credit of three guilders only, or five per cent.
below their current value. It grants a receipt likewise intitling the
bearer to take out the number of ducatoons deposited at any time within
six months, upon paying one-fourth per cent. for the keeping. This
receipt will frequently bring no price in the market. Three guilders
bank money generally sell in the market for three guilders three
stivers, the full value of the ducatoons, if they were taken out of the
bank; and before they can be taken out, one-fourth per cent. must be
paid for the keeping, which would be mere loss to the holder of the
receipt. If the agio of the bank, however, should at any time fall to
three per cent. such receipts might bring some price in the market, and
might sell for one and three-fourths per cent. But the agio of the bank
being now generally about five per cent. such receipts are frequently
allowed to expire, or, as they express it, to fall to the bank. The
receipts which are given for deposits of gold ducats fall to it yet more
 frequently, because a higher warehouse-rent, or one-half per cent. must
 be paid for the keeping of them before they can be taken out again. The
 five per cent. which the bank gains, when deposits either of coin or
bullion are allowed to fall to it, may be considered as the
warehouse-rent for the perpetual keeping of such deposits.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1269"><span class="type-margin"><span>So there is a considerable sum of bank money for which the receipts have expired, but it is not a large proportion of the whole.</span></span>The
 sum of bank money for which the receipts are expired must be very
considerable. It must comprehend the whole original capital of the bank,
 which, it is generally supposed, has been allowed to remain there from
the time it was first deposited, nobody caring either to renew his
receipt or to take out his deposit, as, for the reasons already
assigned, neither the one nor the other could be done without loss. But
whatever may be the amount of this sum, the proportion which it bears to
 the whole mass of bank money is supposed to be very small. The bank of
Amsterdam has for these many years past been the great warehouse of
Europe for bullion, for which the receipts are very seldom allowed to
expire, or, as they express it, to fall to the bank. The far greater
part of the bank money, or of the credits upon the books of the bank, is
 supposed to have been created, for these many years past, by <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>449<span class="bracket">]</span></span> such deposits which the dealers in bullion are continually both making and withdrawing.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1270">No demand can be made upon the bank but by means of a recipice<span class="type-margin"><span>This cannot be drawn out of the bank.</span></span>
 or receipt. The smaller mass of bank money, for which the receipts are
expired, is mixed and confounded with the much greater mass for which
they are still in force; so that, though there may be a considerable sum
 of bank money, for which there are no receipts, there is no specific
sum or portion of it, which may not at any time be demanded by one. The
bank cannot be debtor to two persons for the same thing; and the owner
of bank money who has no receipt, cannot demand payment of the bank till
 he buys one. In ordinary and quiet times, he can find no difficulty in
getting one to buy at the market price, which generally corresponds with
 the price at which he can sell the coin or bullion it intitles him to
take out of the bank.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1271">It might be otherwise during a public calamity; an invasion, for<span class="type-margin"><span>So that if all the holders of bank money desired to exchange it for coin and bullion receipts might command an exorbitant price.</span></span>
 example, such as that of the French in 1672. The owners of bank money
being then all eager to draw it out of the bank, in order to have it in
their own keeping, the demand for receipts might raise their price to an
 exorbitant height. The holders of them might form extravagant
expectations, and, instead of two or three per cent. demand half the
bank money for which credit had been given upon the deposits that the
receipts had respectively been granted for. The enemy, informed of the
constitution of the bank, might even buy them up, in order to prevent
the carrying away of the treasure. In such emergencies, the bank, it is
supposed, would break through its ordinary rule of making payment only
to the holders of receipts. The holders of receipts, who had no bank
money, must have received within two or three per cent. of the value of
the deposit for which their respective receipts had been granted. The
bank, therefore, it is said, would in this case make no scruple of
paying, either with money or bullion, the full value of what the owners
of bank money who could get no receipts were credited for in its books;
paying at the same time two or three per cent. to such holders of
receipts as had no bank money, that being the whole value which in this
state of things could justly be supposed due to them.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1272">Even in ordinary and quiet times it is the interest of the holders of<span class="type-margin"><span>Of late years the bank has always sold bank money at 5 per cent. agio and bought at 4 per cent.</span></span>
 receipts to depress the agio, in order either to buy bank money (and
consequently the bullion, which their receipts would then enable them to
 take out of the bank) so much cheaper, or to sell their receipts to
those who have bank money, and who want to take out bullion, so much
dearer; the price of a receipt being generally equal to the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>450<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 difference between the market price of bank money, and that of the coin
 or bullion for which the receipt had been granted. It is the interest
of the owners of bank money, on the contrary, to raise the agio, in
order either to sell their bank money so much dearer, or to buy a
receipt so much cheaper. To prevent the stock-jobbing tricks which those
 opposite interests might sometimes occasion, the bank has of late years
 come to the resolution to sell at all times bank money for currency, at
 five per cent. agio, and to buy it in again at four per cent. agio. In
consequence of this resolution, the agio can never either rise above
five, or sink below four per cent. and the proportion between the market
 price of bank and that of current money, is kept at all times very near
 to the proportion between their intrinsic values. Before this
resolution was taken, the market price of bank money used sometimes to
rise so high as nine per cent. agio, and sometimes to sink so low as
par, according as opposite interests happened to influence the market.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1273"><span class="type-margin"><span>It professes to lend out no part of the deposits.</span></span>The
 bank of Amsterdam professes to lend out no part of what is deposited
with it, but, for every guilder for which it gives credit in its books,
to keep in its repositories the value of a guilder either in money or
bullion. That it keeps in its repositories all the money or bullion for
which there are receipts in force, for which it is at all times liable
to be called upon, and which, in reality, is continually going from it
and returning to it again, cannot well be doubted. But whether it does
so likewise with regard to that part of its capital, for which the
receipts are long ago expired, for which in ordinary and quiet times it
cannot be called upon, and which in reality is very likely to remain
with it for ever, or as long as the States of the United Provinces
subsist, may perhaps appear more uncertain. At Amsterdam, however, no
point of faith is better established than that for every guilder,
circulated as bank money, there is a correspondent guilder in gold or
silver to be found in the treasure of the bank. The city is guarantee
that it should be so. The bank is under the direction of the four
reigning burgomasters, who are changed every year. Each new set of
burgomasters visits the treasure, compares it with the books, receives
it upon oath, and delivers it over, with the same awful solemnity, to
the set which succeeds<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt912" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt912_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>;
 and in that sober and religious country oaths are not yet disregarded. A
 rotation of this kind seems alone a sufficient security against any
practices which cannot be avowed. Amidst all the revolutions which
faction has ever occasioned in the government of Amsterdam, the
prevailing party has at no time accused their predecessors of infidelity
 in the administration of the bank. No accusation <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>451<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 could have affected more deeply the reputation and fortune of the
disgraced party, and if such an accusation could have been supported, we
 may be assured that it would have been brought. In 1672, when the
French king was at Utrecht, the bank of Amsterdam paid so readily as
left no doubt of the fidelity with which it had observed its
engagements. Some of the pieces which were then brought from its
repositories appeared to have been scorched with the fire which happened
 in the town-house soon after the bank was established.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt913" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt913_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> Those pieces, therefore, must have lain there from that time.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1274">What may be the amount of the treasure in the bank, is a question<span class="type-margin"><span>The amount of treasure in the bank is a subject of conjecture.</span></span>
 which has long employed the speculations of the curious. Nothing but
conjecture can be offered concerning it. It is generally reckoned that
there are about two thousand people who keep accounts with the bank, and
 allowing them to have, one with another, the value of fifteen hundred
pounds sterling lying upon their respective accounts (a very large
allowance), the whole quantity of bank money, and consequently of
treasure in the bank, will amount to about three millions sterling, or,
at eleven guilders the pound sterling, thirty-three millions of
guilders;<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt914" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt914_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 a great sum, and sufficient to carry on a very extensive circulation;
but vastly below the extravagant ideas which some people have formed of
this treasure.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1275">The city of Amsterdam derives a considerable revenue from the<span class="type-margin"><span>The city derives a considerable revenue from the various profits of the bank.</span></span>
 bank. Besides what may be called the warehouse-rent above mentioned,
each person, upon first opening an account with the bank, pays a fee of
ten guilders; and for every new account three guilders three stivers;
for every transfer two stivers; and if the transfer is for less than
three hundred guilders, six stivers, in order to discourage the
multiplicity of small transactions. The person who neglects to balance
his account twice in the year forfeits twenty-five guilders. The person
who orders a transfer for more than is upon his account, is obliged to
pay three per cent. for the sum overdrawn, and his order is set aside
into the bargain. The bank is supposed too to make a considerable profit
 by the sale of the foreign coin or bullion which sometimes falls to it
by the expiring of receipts, and which is always kept till it can be
sold with advantage. It makes a profit likewise by selling bank money at
 five per cent. agio, and buying it in at four. These different
emoluments amount to a good deal more than what is necessary for <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>452<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 paying the salaries of officers, and defraying the expence of
management. What is paid for the keeping of bullion upon receipts, is
alone supposed to amount to a neat annual revenue of between one hundred
 and fifty thousand and two hundred thousand guilders. Public utility,
however, and not revenue, was the original object of this institution.
Its object was to relieve the merchants from the inconvenience of a
disadvantageous exchange. The revenue which has arisen from it was
unforeseen, and may be considered as accidental. But it is now time to
return from this long digression, into which I have been insensibly led
in endeavouring to explain the reasons why the exchange between the
countries which pay in what is called bank money, and those which pay in
 common currency, should generally appear to be in favour of the former,
 and against the latter. The former pay in a species of money of which
the intrinsic value is always the same, and exactly agreeable to the
standard of their respective mints; the latter in a species of money of
which the intrinsic value is continually varying, and is almost always
more or less below that standard.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt915" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt915_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>

 even upon the principles of the commercial system, how unnecessary it

 the balance of trade, upon which, not only these restraints, but almost
 all the other regulations of commerce are founded. When two places
trade with one another, this doctrine supposes that, if the balance be
even, neither of them either loses or gains; but if it leans in any
degree to one side, that one of them loses, and the other gains in
proportion to its declension from the exact equilibrium. Both
suppositions are false. A trade which is forced by means of bounties and
 monopolies, may be, and commonly is disadvantageous to the country in
whose favour it is meant to be established, as I shall endeavour to shew
 hereafter.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt918" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt918_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 But that trade which, without force or constraint, is naturally and
regularly carried on between any two places, is always advantageous,
though not always equally so, to both.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1278">By advantage or gain, I understand, not the
increase of the quantity of gold and silver, but that of the
exchangeable value of the annual produce of the land and labour of the
country, or the increase of the annual revenue of its inhabitants.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1279">If the balance be even, and if the trade between the two places<span class="type-margin"><span>Where
 there is an even balance and the exchange consists wholly of native

 consist altogether in the exchange of their native commodities, they
will, upon most occasions, not only both gain, but they will gain
equally, or very near equally: each will in this case afford a market
for a part of the surplus produce of the other: each will replace a
capital which had been employed in raising and preparing for the market<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt919" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt919_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 this part of the surplus produce of the other, and which had been
distributed among, and given revenue and maintenance to a certain number
 of its inhabitants. Some part of the inhabitants of each, therefore,
will indirectly derive their revenue and maintenance from the other. As
the commodities exchanged too are supposed to be of equal value, so the
two capitals employed in the trade will, upon most occasions, be equal,
or very nearly equal; and both being employed in raising the native
commodities of the two countries, the revenue and maintenance which
their distribution will afford to the inhabitants of each will be equal,
 or very nearly equal. This revenue and maintenance, thus mutually
afforded, will be greater or smaller in proportion to the extent of
their dealings. If these should annually amount to an hundred thousand
pounds, for example, or to a million on each side, each of them would
afford an annual revenue in the one case of an hundred thousand pounds,
in the other, of a million, to the inhabitants of the other.</p>

<p id="Smith_0206-01_1280"><span class="type-margin"><span>If one
exported nothing but native commodities, and the other nothing but
foreign, both would gain, but the first would gain most.</span></span>If
 their trade should be of such a nature that one of them exported to the
 other nothing but native commodities, while the returns of that other
consisted altogether in foreign goods; the balance, in this case, would
still be supposed even, commodities being paid for with commodities.
They would, in this case too, both gain, but they would not gain
equally; and the inhabitants of the country which exported nothing but
native commodities would derive the greatest revenue from the trade. If
England, for example, should import from France nothing but the native
commodities of that country, and, not having such commodities of its own
 as were in demand there, should annually repay them by sending thither a
 large quantity of foreign goods, tobacco, we shall suppose, and East
India goods; this trade, though it would give some revenue to the
inhabitants of both countries, would give more to those of France than
to those of England. The whole French capital annually employed in it
would annually be distributed among the people of France. But that part
of the English capital only which was employed in producing the English
commodities with which those foreign goods were purchased, would be
annually distributed among the people of England. The greater part of it
 would replace the capitals which had been employed in Virginia,
Indostan, and China, and which had given revenue and maintenance to the
inhabitants of those distant countries. If the capitals were equal, or
nearly equal, therefore, this employment of the French capital would
augment much more the revenue of the people of France, than that of the
English capital would the revenue of the people of England. France would
 in this case carry on a direct foreign trade of consumption with
England; whereas England would carry on a round-about trade of the same
kind with France. The different effects of a capital employed in the
direct, and of one employed in the round-about foreign trade of
consumption, have already been fully explained.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt920" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt920_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1281"><span class="type-margin"><span>Mixed cases conform to the principle.</span></span>There
 is not, probably, between any two countries, a trade which consists
altogether in the exchange either of native commodities on both sides,
or of native commodities on one side and of foreign goods on the other.
Almost all countries exchange with one another partly native and partly
foreign goods. That country, however, in whose cargoes there is the
greatest proportion of native, and the least of foreign goods, will
always be the principal gainer.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1282"><span class="type-margin"><span>It would be no worse for England to pay in gold and silver than in tobacco.</span></span>If
 it was not with tobacco and East India goods, but with gold and silver,
 that England paid for the commodities annually imported from France,
the balance, in this case, would be supposed uneven, commodities <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>455<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 not being paid for with commodities, but with gold and silver. The
trade, however, would, in this case, as in the foregoing, give some
revenue to the inhabitants of both countries, but more to those of
France than to those of England. It would give some revenue to those of
England. The capital which had been employed in producing the English
goods that purchased this gold and silver, the capital which had been
distributed among, and given revenue to, certain inhabitants of England,
 would thereby be replaced, and enabled to continue that employment. The
 whole capital of England would no more be diminished by this
exportation of gold and silver, than by the exportation of an equal
value of any other goods. On the contrary, it would, in most cases, be
augmented. No goods are sent abroad but those for which the demand is
supposed to be greater abroad than at home, and of which the returns
consequently, it is expected, will be of more value at home than the
commodities exported. If the tobacco which, in England, is worth only a
hundred thousand pounds, when sent to France will purchase wine which
is, in England, worth a hundred and ten thousand pounds, the exchange
will augment the capital of England by ten thousand pounds. If a hundred
 thousand pounds of English gold, in the same manner, purchase French
wine, which, in England, is worth a hundred and ten thousand, this
exchange will equally augment the capital of England by ten thousand
pounds. As a merchant who has a hundred and ten thousand pounds worth of
 wine in his cellar, is a richer man than he who has only a hundred
thousand pounds worth of tobacco in his warehouse, so is he likewise a
richer man than he who has only a hundred thousand pounds worth of gold
in his coffers. He can put into motion a greater quantity of industry,
and give revenue, maintenance, and employment, to a greater number of
people than either of the other two. But the capital of the country is
equal to the capitals of all its different inhabitants, and the quantity
 of industry which can be annually maintained in it, is equal to what
all those different capitals can maintain. Both the capital of the
country, therefore, and the quantity of industry which can be annually
maintained in it, must generally be augmented by this exchange. It
would, indeed, be more advantageous for England that it could purchase
the wines of France with its own hard-ware and broad-cloth, than with
either the tobacco of Virginia, or the gold and silver of Brazil and
Peru. A direct foreign trade of consumption is always more advantageous
than a round-about one. But a round-about foreign trade of consumption,
which is carried on with gold and silver, does not seem to be less <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>456<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 advantageous than any other equally round-about one. Neither is a
country which has no mines, more likely to be exhausted of gold and
silver by this annual exportation of those metals, than one which does
not grow tobacco by the like annual exportation of that plant. As a
country which has where-withal to buy tobacco will never be long in want
 of it, so neither will one be long in want of gold and silver which has
 wherewithal to purchase those metals.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1283"><span class="type-margin"><span>The arguments against the French wine trade are fallacious.</span></span>It
 is a losing trade, it is said, which a workman carries on with the
alehouse; and the trade which a manufacturing nation would naturally
carry on with a wine country, may be considered as a trade of the same
nature. I answer, that the trade with the alehouse is not necessarily a
losing trade. In its own nature it is just as advantageous as any other,
 though, perhaps, somewhat more liable to be abused. The employment of a
 brewer, and even that of a retailer of fermented liquors, are as
necessary divisions of labour as any other. It will generally be more
advantageous for a workman to buy of the brewer the quantity he has
occasion for, than to brew<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt921" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt921_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 it himself, and if he is a poor workman, it will generally be more
advantageous for him to buy it, by little and little, of the retailer,
than a large quantity of the brewer. He may no doubt buy too much of
either, as he may of any other dealers in his neighbourhood, of the
butcher, if he is a glutton, or of the draper, if he affects to be a
beau among his companions. It is advantageous to the great body of
workmen, notwithstanding, that all these trades should be free, though
this freedom may be abused in all of them, and is more likely to be so,
perhaps, in some than in others. Though individuals, besides, may
sometimes ruin their fortunes by an excessive consumption of fermented
liquors, there seems to be no risk that a nation should do so. Though in
 every country there are many people who spend upon such liquors more
than they can afford, there are always many more who spend less. It
deserves to be remarked too, that, if we consult experience, the
cheapness of wine seems to be a cause, not of drunkenness, but of
sobriety. The inhabitants of the wine countries are in general the
soberest people in Europe; witness the Spaniards, the Italians, and the
inhabitants of the southern provinces of France. People are seldom
guilty of excess in what is their daily fare. Nobody affects the
character of liberality and good fellowship, by being profuse of a
liquor which is as cheap as small beer. On the contrary, in the
countries which, either from<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt922" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt922_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 excessive heat or cold, produce no grapes, and where wine consequently
is dear and a rarity, drunkenness is a common vice, as among the
northern <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>457<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 nations, and all those who live between the tropics, the negroes, for
example, on the coast of Guinea. When a French regiment comes from some
of the northern provinces of France, where wine is somewhat dear, to be
quartered in the southern, where it is very cheap, the soldiers, I have
frequently heard it observed, are at first debauched by the cheapness
and novelty of good wine; but after a few months residence, the greater
part of them become as sober as the rest of the inhabitants. Were the
duties upon foreign wines, and the excises upon malt, beer, and ale, to
be taken away all at once, it might, in the same manner, occasion in
Great Britain a pretty general and temporary drunkenness among the
middling and inferior ranks of people, which would probably be soon
followed by a permanent and almost universal sobriety. At present
drunkenness is by no means the vice of people of fashion, or of those
who can easily afford the most expensive liquors. A gentleman drunk with
 ale, has scarce ever been seen among us.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt923" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt923_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>
 The restraints upon the wine trade in Great Britain, besides, do not so
 much seem calculated to hinder the people from going, if I may say so,
to the alehouse, as from going where they can buy the best and cheapest
liquor. They favour the wine trade of Portugal, and discourage that of
France. The Portuguese, it is said, indeed, are better customers for our
 manufactures than the French, and should therefore be encouraged in
preference to them. As they give us their custom, it is pretended, we
should give them ours. The sneaking arts of underling<span class="type-margin"><span>The
 sneaking arts of underling tradesmen have been erected into political
maxims and commerce has become a source of discord instead of unity.</span></span>
 tradesmen are thus erected into political maxims for the conduct of a
great empire; for it is the most underling tradesmen only who make it a
rule to employ chiefly their own customers. A great trader purchases his
 goods always where they are cheapest and best, without regard to any
little interest of this kind.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1284">By such maxims as these, however, nations
have been taught that their interest consisted in beggaring all their
neighbours. Each nation has been made to look with an invidious eye upon
 the prosperity of all the nations with which it trades, and to consider
 their gain as its own loss. Commerce, which ought naturally to be,
among nations, as among individuals, a bond of union and friendship, has
 become the most fertile source of discord and animosity. The capricious
 ambition of kings and ministers has not, during the present and the
preceding century, been more fatal to the repose of Europe, than the
impertinent jealousy of merchants and manufacturers. The violence and
injustice of the rulers of mankind is an ancient evil, for which, I am
afraid, the nature of human affairs can scarce admit of a remedy. But
the mean <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>458<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 rapacity, the monopolizing spirit of merchants and manufacturers, who
neither are, nor ought to be, the rulers of mankind, though it cannot
perhaps be corrected, may very easily be prevented from disturbing the
tranquillity of any body but themselves.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1285"><span class="type-margin"><span>The sophistry of merchants inspired by the spirit of monopoly has confounded the common-sense of mankind.</span></span>That
 it was the spirit of monopoly which originally both invented and
propagated this doctrine, cannot be doubted; and they who first taught
it were by no means such fools as they who believed it. In every country
 it always is and must be the interest of the great body of the people
to buy whatever they want of those who sell it cheapest. The proposition
 is so very manifest, that it seems ridiculous to take any pains to
prove it; nor could it ever have been called in question, had not the
interested sophistry of merchants and manufacturers confounded the
common sense of mankind. Their interest is, in this respect, directly
opposite to that of the great body of the people. As it is the interest
of the freemen of a corporation to hinder the rest of the inhabitants
from employing any workmen but themselves, so it is the interest of the
merchants and manufacturers of every country to secure to themselves the
 monopoly of the home market. Hence in Great Britain, and in most other
European countries, the extraordinary duties upon almost all goods
imported by alien merchants. Hence the high duties and prohibitions upon
 all those foreign manufactures which can come into competition with our
 own. Hence too the extraordinary restraints upon the importation of
almost all sorts of goods from those countries with which the balance of
 trade is supposed to be disadvantageous; that is, from those against
whom national animosity happens to be most violently inflamed.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1286"><span class="type-margin"><span>Wealthy neighbours are an advantage to a nation as well as an individual.</span></span>The
 wealth of a neighbouring nation, however, though dangerous in war and
politics, is certainly advantageous in trade. In a state of hostility it
 may enable our enemies to maintain fleets and armies superior to our
own; but in a state of peace and commerce it must likewise enable them
to exchange with us to a greater value, and to afford a better market,
either for the immediate produce of our own industry, or for whatever is
 purchased with that produce. As a rich man is likely to be a better
customer to the industrious people in his neighbourhood, than a poor, so
 is likewise a rich nation. A rich man, indeed, who is himself a
manufacturer, is a very dangerous neighbour to all those who deal in the
 same way. All the rest of the neighbourhood, however, by far the
greatest number, profit by the good market which his expence affords
them. They even profit by his underselling the poorer workmen who deal
in the same way with him. The manufacturers of a rich nation, in the
same manner, may no doubt be <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>459<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 very dangerous rivals to those of their neighbours. This very
competition, however, is advantageous to the great body of the people,
who profit greatly besides by the good market which the great expence of
 such a nation affords them in every other way. Private people who want
to make a fortune, never think of retiring to the remote and poor
provinces of the country, but resort either to the capital, or to some
of the great commercial towns. They know, that, where little wealth
circulates, there is little to be got, but that where a great deal is in
 motion, some share of it may fall to them. The same maxims which would
in this manner direct the common sense of one, or ten, or twenty
individuals, should regulate the judgment of one, or ten, or twenty
millions, and should make a whole nation regard the riches of its
neighbours, as a probable cause and occasion for itself to acquire
riches. A nation that would enrich itself by foreign trade, is certainly
 most likely to do so when its neighbours are all rich, industrious, and
 commercial nations. A great nation surrounded on all sides by wandering
 savages and poor barbarians might, no doubt, acquire riches by the
cultivation of its own lands, and by its own interior commerce, but not
by foreign trade. It seems to have been in this manner that the ancient
Egyptians and the modern Chinese acquired their great wealth. The
ancient Egyptians, it is said, neglected foreign commerce,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt924" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt924_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> and the modern Chinese, it is known, hold it in the utmost contempt,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt925" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt925_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 and scarce deign to afford it the decent protection of the laws. The
modern maxims of foreign commerce, by aiming at the impoverishment of
all our neighbours, so far as they are capable of producing their
intended effect, tend to render that very commerce insignificant and
contemptible.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1287">It is in consequence of these maxims that the commerce between<span class="type-margin"><span>The French trade, if not restrained, would be much more advantageous to Great Britain than the American.</span></span>
 France and England has in both countries been subjected to so many
discouragements and restraints. If those two countries, however, were to
 consider their real interest, without either mercantile jealousy or
national animosity, the commerce of France might be more advantageous to
 Great Britain than that of any other country, and for the same reason
that of Great Britain to France. France is the nearest neighbour to
Great Britain. In the trade between the southern coast of England and
the northern and north-western coasts of France, the returns might be
expected, in the same manner as in the inland trade, four, five, or six
times in the year. The capital, therefore, employed in this trade, could
 in each of the two countries keep in motion four, five, or six times
the quantity of industry, and afford employment and <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>460<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
 subsistence to four, five, or six times the number of people, which an
equal capital could do in the greater part of the other branches of
foreign trade. Between the parts of France and Great Britain most remote
 from one another, the returns might be expected, at least, once in the
year, and even this trade would so far be at least equally advantageous
as the greater part of the other branches of our foreign European trade.
 It would be, at least, three times more advantageous, than the boasted
trade with our North American colonies, in which the returns were seldom
 made in less than three years, frequently not in less than four or five
 years. France, besides, is supposed to contain twenty-four millions of
inhabitants.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt926" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt926_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> Our North American colonies were never supposed to contain more than three millions:<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt927" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt927_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a>
 And France is a much richer country than North America; though, on
account of the more unequal distribution of riches, there is much more
poverty and beggary in the one country, than in the other. France
therefore could afford a market at least eight times more extensive,
and, on account of the superior frequency of the returns, four and
twenty times more advantageous, than that which our North American
colonies ever afforded. The trade of Great Britain would be just as
advantageous to France, and, in proportion to the wealth, population and
 proximity of the respective countries, would have the same superiority
over that which France carries on with her own colonies. Such is the
very great difference between that trade which the wisdom of both
nations has thought proper to discourage, and that which it has favoured
 the most.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1288"><span class="type-margin"><span>But the traders of France and England are jealous of each other.</span></span>But
 the very same circumstances which would have rendered an open and free
commerce between the two countries so advantageous to both, have
occasioned the principal obstructions to that commerce. Being
neighbours, they are necessarily enemies, and the wealth and power of
each becomes, upon that account, more formidable to the other; and what
would increase the advantage of national friendship, serves only to
inflame the violence of national animosity. They are both rich and
industrious nations; and the merchants and manufacturers of each, dread
the competition of the skill and activity of those of the other.
Mercantile jealousy is excited, and both inflames, and is itself
inflamed, by the violence of national animosity: And the traders of both
 countries have announced, with all the passionate confidence of
interested falsehood, the certain ruin of each, in consequence of that
unfavourable balance of trade, which, they pretend, would be the
infallible effect of an unrestrained commerce with the other.<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt928" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt928_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>

<p id="Smith_0206-01_1289">There is no commercial country in Europe of which the approaching<span class="type-margin"><span>No
 country has ever been impoverished by an unfavourable balance, and
those which have the freest trade have been the most enriched by foreign
 trade</span></span> ruin has not frequently been foretold by the
pretended doctors of this system, from an unfavourable balance of trade.
 After all the anxiety, however, which they have excited about this,
after all the vain attempts of almost all trading nations to turn that
balance in their own favour and against their neighbours, it does not
appear that any one nation in Europe has been in any respect
impoverished by this cause. Every town and country, on the contrary, in
proportion as they have opened their ports to all nations, instead of
being ruined by this free trade, as the principles of the commercial
system would lead us to expect, have been enriched by it. Though there
are in Europe, indeed, a few towns which in some respects deserve the
name of free ports, there is no country which does so. Holland, perhaps,
 approaches the nearest to this character of any, though still very
remote from it; and Holland, it is acknowledged, not only derives its
whole wealth, but a great part of its necessary subsistence, from
foreign trade.</p>
<p id="Smith_0206-01_1290">There is another balance, indeed, which has already been explained,<a href="#lf0206-01_footnote_nt929" id="lf0206-01_footnote_nt929_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a><span class="type-margin"><span>Prosperity and decay depend on the balance of produce and consumption,</span></span>
 very different from the balance of trade, and which, according as it
happens to be either favourable or unfavourable, necessarily occasions
the prosperity or decay of every nation. This is the balance of the
annual produce and consumption. If the exchangeable value of the annual
produce, it has already been observed, exceeds that of the annual
consumption, the capital of the society must annually increase in
proportion to this excess. The society in this case lives within its
revenue, and what is annually saved out of its revenue, is naturally
added to its capital, and employed so as to increase still further the
annual produce. If the exchangeable value of the annual produce, on the
contrary, fall short of the annual consumption, the capital of the
society must annually decay in proportion to this deficiency. The
expence of the society in this case exceeds its revenue, and necessarily
 encroaches upon its capital. Its capital, therefore, must necessarily
decay, and, together with it, the exchangeable value of the annual
produce of its industry.</p>

which had no foreign trade, but which was entirely separated from all

the wealth, population, and improvement may be either gradually
increasing or gradually decaying.</p>

half a century, perhaps, together; the gold and silver which comes into
it during all this time may be all immediately sent out of it; its
circulating coin may gradually decay, different sorts of paper money
being substituted in its place, and even the debts too which it
contracts in the principal nations with whom it deals, may be gradually
increasing; and yet its real wealth, the exchangeable value of the
annual produce of its lands and labour, may, during the same period,
have been increasing in a much greater proportion. The state of our

 to ‘Hope’ in edition 5. The celebrated firm of Hope, merchant-bankers
in Amsterdam, was founded by a Scotchman in the seventeenth century (see
 Sir Thomas Hope in the <span class="ital">Dictionary of National Biography</span>).
 Henry Hope was born in Boston, Mass., in 1736, and passed six years in a
 banking house in England before he joined his relatives in Amsterdam.
He became a partner with them, and on the death of Adrian Hope the
conduct of the whole of the business of the firm devolved upon him. When
 the French invaded Holland in 1794 he retired to England. He died on
25th February, 1811, leaving £1,160,000 (<span class="ital">Gentleman’s Magazine,</span> March, 1811).</p></div>

 modern editions are copied from the fourth edition. Thorold Rogers’
edition, however, though said in the preface to be copied from the
fourth, as a matter of fact follows the third. In one instance, indeed,
the omission of ‘so’ before ‘as long as’ at vol. i., p. 43, line 25 (in
the present edition), Rogers’ text agrees with that of the fourth
edition rather than the third, but this is an accidental coincidence in
error; the error is a particularly easy one to make and it is actually
corrected in the errata to the fourth edition, so that it is not really
the reading of that edition. The fifth edition must not be confused with
 a spurious ‘fifth edition with additions’ in 2 vols., 8vo, published in
 Dublin in 1793 with the ‘Advertisement’ to the third edition
deliberately falsified by the substitution of ‘fifth’ for ‘third’ in the
 sentence ‘To this third edition however I have made several additions’.
 It is perhaps the existence of this spurious ‘fifth edition’ which has
led several writers (<span class="ital">e.g.,</span> Rae, <span class="ital">Life of Adam Smith,</span> p. 293) to ignore the genuine fifth edition. The sixth edition is dated 1791.</p></div>

 phrase, if used at all before this time, was not a familiar one. Its

 . . . When once men come to be governed by written laws, all the rest
comes on apace . . . No number of men, when once they enjoy quiet, and
no man needs to fear his neighbour, will be long without learning to
divide and subdivide their labour. <span class="csc">Hor.</span> I don’t understand you. <span class="csc">Cleo.</span>
 Man, as I have hinted before, naturally loves to imitate what he sees
others do, which is the reason that savage people all do the same thing:
 this hinders them from meliorating their condition, though they are
always wishing for it: but if one will wholly apply himself to the
making of bows and arrows, whilst another provides food, a third builds
huts, a fourth makes garments, and a fifth utensils, they not only
become useful to one another, but the callings and employments
themselves will, in the same number of years, receive much greater
improvements, than if all had been promiscuously followed by every one
of the five. <span class="csc">Hor.</span> I believe you are perfectly
right there; and the truth of what you say is in nothing so conspicuous
as it is in watch-making, which is come to a higher degree of perfection
 than it would have been arrived at yet, if the whole had always
remained the employment of one person; and I am persuaded that even the
plenty we have of clocks and watches, as well as the exactness and
beauty they may be made of, are chiefly owing to the division that has
been made of that art into many branches.’ The index contains, ‘Labour,
The usefulness of dividing and subdividing it’. Joseph Harris, <span class="ital">Essay upon Money and Coins,</span>
 1757, pt. i., § 12, treats of the ‘usefulness of distinct trades,’ or
‘the advantages accruing to mankind from their betaking themselves
severally to different occupations,’ but does not use the phrase

 pretty story is largely, at any rate, mythical. It appears to have
grown out of a misreading (not necessarily by Smith) of the following
passage: ‘They used before to work with a buoy in the cylinder enclosed
in a pipe, which buoy rose when the steam was strong, and opened the
injection, and made a stroke; thereby they were capable of only giving
six, eight or ten strokes in a minute, till a boy, Humphry Potter, who
attended the engine, added (what he called scoggan) a catch that the
beam Q always opened; and then it would go fifteen or sixteen strokes in
 a minute. But this being perplexed with catches and strings, Mr. Henry
Beighton, in an engine he had built at Newcastle-on-Tyne in 1718, took
them all away, the beam itself simply supplying all much better.’—J. T.
Desaguliers, <span class="ital">Course of Experimental Philosophy,</span> vol. ii., 1744, p. 533. From pp. 469, 471, it appears that hand labour was originally used before the ‘buoy’ was devised.]</p></div>

are very seldom the same sort of people, those that invent arts and
improvements in them and those that inquire into the reason of things:
this latter is most commonly practised by such as are idle and indolent,

fact that men naturally fell upon one commodity with which to compare
the value of all other commodities. When this commodity was once
selected it became the medium of exchange. In this chapter money comes
into use from the first as a medium of exchange, and its use as a
measure of value is not mentioned. The next chapter explains that it is

 England and this part of the world, wheat being the constant and most

together: though perhaps the scarcity of one year, caused by the
accidents of the season, may very much vary it from the immediately
precedent or following. Wheat, therefore, in this part of the world (and
 that grain which is the constant general food of any other country) is
the fittest measure to judge of the altered value of things in any long
tract of time: and therefore wheat here, rice in Turkey, etc., is the
fittest thing to reserve a rent in, which is designed to be constantly
the same for all future ages. But money is the best measure of the
altered value of things in a few years: because its vent is the same and
 its quantity alters slowly. But wheat, or any other grain, cannot serve

England then stood in the names of foreigners,’ which is also in
Sinclair, <span class="ital">History of the Public Revenue,</span> pt.
iii., 1790, p. 366. From this it appears that foreigners held £4,627,858
 of Bank stock and £10,328,537 in the other funds, which did not include
 South Sea and East India stock. Fairman had reason to believe that the
South Sea holding amounted to £2,500,000 and the East Indian to more
than £500,000, which would make in all about £18,000,000. In 1806, he
says, the total claiming exemption from income tax (foreigners were
exempt) was £18,500,000, but this did not include Bank stock.]</p></div>

assumed either that profits mean profits on turn-over and not on capital

 account of the provisions of the Acts regarding settlement, though not
incorrect, inverts the order of the ideas which prompted them. The
preamble complains that owing to defects in the law ‘poor people are not
 restrained from going from one parish to another, and therefore do
endeavour to settle themselves in those parishes where there is the best
 stock,’ and so forth, and the Act therefore gives the justices power,
‘within forty days after any such person or persons coming so to settle
as aforesaid,’ to remove them ‘to such parish where he or they were last
 legally settled either as a native, householder, sojourner, apprentice

 Act, 13 &amp; 14 Car. II., c. 12, giving the justices power to remove

by making the attainment of a settlement more difficult, would appear to
 have made it less necessary for a parish to put in force the power of
removal, and therefore to have assisted rather than obstructed the free
circulation of labour. The poor law commissioners of 1834, long after
the power of removal had been abolished in 1795, found the law of
settlement a great obstruction to the free circulation of labour,
because men were afraid of gaining a new settlement, not because a new

tax upon silver, the price of that metal might not, upon that account,
sink immediately in the European market. As long as the quantity brought
 thither continued the same as before, it would still continue to sell
at the same price. The first and immediate effect of this change, would
be to increase the profits of mining, the undertaker of the mine now
gaining all that he had been used to pay to the king. These great
profits would soon tempt a greater number of people to undertake the
working of new mines. Many mines would be wrought which cannot be
wrought at present, because they cannot afford to pay this tax, and the
quantity of silver brought to market would, in a few years be so much
augmented, probably, as to sink its price about one-fifth below its
present standard. This diminution in the value of silver would again
reduce the profits of mining nearly to their present rate.’]</p></div>

any more.” This eminent author adds “that King Henry VIII., that
magnificent and expensive Prince, wore ordinarily cloth hose, except
there came from Spain, by great chance, a pair of silk stockings; for
Spain very early abounded in silk. His son, King Edward VI., was
presented with a pair of long Spanish silk stockings by his merchant,
Sir Thomas Gresham, and the present was then much taken notice of.” Thus
 it is plain that the invention of knit silk stockings originally came
from Spain. Others relate that one William Rider, an apprentice on
London Bridge, seeing at the house of an Italian merchant a pair of knit
 worsted stockings from Mantua, made with great skill a pair exactly
like them, which he presented in the year 1564 to William Earl of
Pembroke, and were the first of that kind worn in England.’—Adam

 method described in the text was by no means either the most common or
the most expensive one in which those adventurers sometimes raised money
 by circulation. It frequently happened that A in Edinburgh would enable
 B in London to pay the first bill of exchange by drawing, a few days
before it became due, a second bill at three months date upon the same B
 in London. This bill, being payable to his own order, A sold in
Edinburgh at par; and with its contents purchased bills upon London
payable at sight to the order of B, to whom he sent them by the post.
Towards the end of the late war, the exchange between Edinburgh and
London was frequently three per cent. against Edinburgh, and those bills
 at sight must frequently have cost A that premium. This transaction
therefore being repeated at least four times in the year, and being
loaded with a commission of at least one half per cent. upon each
repetition, must at that period have cost A at least fourteen per cent.
in the year. At other times A would enable B to discharge the first bill
 of exchange by drawing, a few days before it became due, a second bill
at two months date; not upon B, but upon some third person, C, for
example, in London. This other bill was made payable to the order of B,
who, upon its being accepted by C, discounted it with some banker in
London; and A enabled C to discharge it by drawing, a few days before it
 became due, a third bill, likewise at two months date, sometimes upon
his first correspondent B, and sometimes upon some fourth or fifth
person, D or E, for example. This third bill was made payable to the
order of C; who, as soon as it was accepted, discounted it in the same
manner with some banker in London. Such operations being repeated at
least six times in the year, and being loaded with a commission of at
least one-half per cent. upon each repetition, together with the legal
interest of five per cent., this method of raising money, in the same
manner as that described in the text, must have cost A something more
than eight per cent. By saving, however, the exchange between Edinburgh
and London it was less expensive than that mentioned in the foregoing
part of this note; but then it required an established credit with more
houses than one in London, an advantage which many of these adventurers
could not always find it easy to procure. [This note appears first in
ed. 2. Playfair observes that the calculation of the loss of 14 per
cent. by the first method is wrong, since ‘if A at Edinburgh negotiated
his bills on London at 3 per cent. loss, he would gain as much in
purchasing bills on London with the money.’—Ed. of <span class="ital">Wealth of Nations,</span> vol. i., p. 483, note.]</p></div>

appears that Smith’s account of the proceedings of the bank is extremely
 accurate, a fact which is doubtless due to his old pupil, the Duke of
Buccleuch, having been one of the principal shareholders. Writing to
Pulteney on 5th September, 1772, Smith says, ‘though I have had no
concern myself in the public calamities, some of the friends in whom I
interest myself the most have been deeply concerned in them; and my
attention has been a good deal occupied about the most proper method of
extricating them’. The extrication was effected chiefly by the sale of
redeemable annuities. See Rae, <span class="ital">Life of Adam Smith,</span> 1895, pp. 253-255; David Macpherson, <span class="ital">Annals of Commerce,</span> vol. iii., pp. 525, 553; <span class="ital">House of Commons’ Journals,</span>

favour of that place which had the ordinary course of exchange in its
favour. The ordinary course of exchange might, indeed, in this case, be a
 tolerable indication of the ordinary state of debt and credit between
them, and show which of the two countries usually had occasion to send
out money to the other. But the ordinary state of debt and credit
between any two places is not always entirely regulated by the ordinary
course of their dealings with one another, but is influenced by that of
the dealings of both with many other countries. If it was usual, for
example, for the merchants of England to pay the goods which they buy
from Hamburgh, Dantzick, Riga, &amp;c., by bills upon Holland, the
ordinary state of debt and credit between England and Holland would not
be entirely regulated by the ordinary course of the dealings of those
two countries with one another, but would be influenced by that of
England with those other places. England might, in this case, be
annually obliged to send out money to Holland, though its annual exports
 to that country exceeded the annual value of its imports from it, and
though what is called the balance of trade was very much in favour of
England.</p><p id="Smith_0206-01_2202">‘Hitherto I have been endeavouring to shew.’ See above, p. 440, note 3.]</p></div>

 paragraph was written in the year 1775. [But not exactly as it stands,
since ed. 1 reads ‘the late disturbances’ instead of ‘the present
disturbances’. We can only conjecture that Smith thought that the
disturbances were past either when he was writing or when he returned
the proof to the printers, or that they would be past by the time his
book was published. The alteration of ‘late’ to ‘present’ was made in
ed. 2, and the footnote added in ed. 3. In vol. ii. all eds. read
‘present disturbances’ on pp. 75, 86 and 115 and ‘late disturbances’ on
p. 79. The two expressions could scarcely have been used at the same
time, so we must suppose that ‘late’ was corrected into ‘present’ on pp.
 75, 86 and 115, or that ‘present’ was corrected into ‘late’ on p. 79,
but we cannot tell for certain which of the two things happened.]</p></div>
